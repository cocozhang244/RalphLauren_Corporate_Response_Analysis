Ralph Lauren Corporation - Water Security 2022
W0. Introduction
W0.1
(W0.1) Give a general description of and introduction to your organization.
Founded in 1967 by Mr. Ralph Lauren, we are a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear,
accessories, home furnishings, fragrances, and hospitality. For more than 50 years, Ralph Lauren has sought to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and
timeless style. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products, brands, distribution channels, and international
markets. We believe that our global reach, breadth of lifestyle product offerings, and multi-channel distribution are unique among luxury and apparel companies. Our global
reach is extensive, as we sell directly to customers throughout the world via our 504 retail stores and 684 concession-based shop-within-shops, as well as through our own
digital commerce sites and those of various third-party digital partners. Merchandise is also available through our wholesale distribution channels at approximately 9,000
doors worldwide, the majority in specialty stores, as well as through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers. In addition to our directly operated stores
and shops, our international licensing partners operate 148 Ralph Lauren stores and shops.  
We’ve stood for values and things that last — things that are timeless and enduring; things to cherish as they age and that never fall out of style. This belief remains central to
who we are today. It is with this core belief that we have reimagined our pursuit of a more equitable and sustainable future. We are taking what it means to create timeless
style and creating a business and products that are not only enduring but can inspire the dream of a better life with a plan for a better future. We call this evolution Timeless by
Design. With Timeless by Design, we are taking our philosophy of creating products that are meant to be passed down through generations and applying it to everything that
we do — from how we make our products, to how we impact the Earth, and how we champion our people and our communities. Our Timeless by Design approach is
supported by three pillars: Create with Intent, Protect the Environment and Champion Better Lives.  
Create With Intent – We’ve always created products that are meant to be loved and passed down through generations. Now, we are making those pieces more responsibly:
with more sustainable materials, according to circular design principles, and by instilling cultural sustainability practices. By designing timelessness in from the start, we’ll
enable all our products to live on responsibly. 
Protect The Environment – Creating timeless products goes beyond their design. It means creating them and operating our business in ways that respect our planet, such as
using renewable energy, managing our waste properly and using our water responsibly. By adopting practices that help preserve the world’s natural sources, we can be
stewards in protecting our environment for generations to come. 
Champion Better Lives – Creating a business that is timeless and has a positive impact on tomorrow means building relationships that stand the test of time — ensuring
everyone is included, respected and empowered. That’s why we’re committed to supporting our employees, our partners and those within our communities today and working
to find more ways to help them build a brighter future.

Direct use: We identified water availability in our direct operations as ‘not very important’ given that currently, use of freshwater in our owned and operated facilities is only
related to domestic purposes that do not represent high water intensity, and we expect this to continue to be the case in the future. Indirect use: Currently, the use of
freshwater in our indirect operations is vital for our raw materials input (e.g. cotton growing) as well as manufacturing processes (e.g. fabric and garment dyeing and washing)
in our value chain, and we expect this to continue in the future. Our approach to water stewardship includes actions that address overall use and quality, protecting
watersheds and ensuring access. We partner with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to advance our work in this area and set a comprehensive strategy for water stewardship
and water use reductions in our value chain. We analyzed our value chain through the WWF Water Risk Filter to map key areas of water risk and develop a comprehensive
value chain water footprint. The analysis also identified opportunities for watershed conservation, reduced water consumption and improved community access. Our goal to
reduce water use by at least 20 percent by 2025 relates to manufacturing and processing in our supply chain and water use in our owned and operated facilities, compared to
a FY20 baseline. In our direct operations, we will seek opportunities to decrease water use intensity in landscaping at our distribution centers and through application of low-
flow fixtures in our distribution centers, offices, and stores. In our manufacturing supply chain, we focus on improving water use efficiency while also considering the shared
basin-level water needs where our suppliers’ fabric mills, factories, and laundries are located. In priority water-stressed locations, we are contributing to collective action
projects with WWF, local partners and experts to scale water use assessments and reduction strategies.

Important
Direct use (current): We identified the water availability in our direct operations as ‘not very important’ given the use of water in Ralph Lauren’s owned and operated facilities is
only related to domestic purposes that do not represent high water intensity. The use of recycled water in our business operations is largely dependent upon the availability
and adoption of water recycling technology in the leased, multi-tenant buildings that we largely occupy. Indirect use (current): Our manufacturing supply chain uses recycled
and process water in the production processes (e.g., dyeing and washing to decrease dependency on freshwater resources and costs). Due to the limited scale and
application, the usage of recycled and process water is currently not as high as compared to freshwater. There are geographies where our products and materials are
manufactured that have regulations related to the Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) or the use of recycled water. As such, the availability of water resources and our
manufacturers’ ability to recycle and reuse process water is therefore identified as an important factor in our indirect use. Direct use (future): The use of recycled and process
water in our owned and operated facilities is likely to remain constant. However, our use of recycled and process water could increase if there are improvements in the
availability and adoption of water recycling technology in the leased, multi-tenant buildings that we largely occupy. Indirect use (future): We also foresee the more urgent need
to promote water recycling in our manufacturing supply chain. As water recycling technologies mature in our sourcing regions, it has the potential to become a common
practice in the manufacturing facilities globally, and thus help reduce our manufacturing dependency on freshwater resources.

Water use in our owned and operated facilities is only related to domestic purposes that don’t represent high water intensity. Reduction in water use in our business
operations is largely dependent upon the availability and adoption of water efficiency technology in the leased multi-tenant buildings we largely occupy. As such, we do
not expect total water withdrawal volumes to change substantively going forward; however, total water withdrawal efficiency may change depending on company
revenue.

Rationale for this coverage
We request water usage and management data reporting and verification from all our finished goods and material manufacturing suppliers through the Sustainable Apparel
Coalition’s (SAC) Higg Index Facility Environmental Module. In FY22, we fully integrated sustainability key performance indicators into our vendor scorecard, with specific
focuses on carbon, water and sustainable chemical management performance, which now sit alongside other business-critical issues, such as quality. Our vendor
scorecard links supplier capacity and performance to purchasing decisions.
Impact of the engagement and measures of success
We have a public goal to achieve at least a 20% reduction in total water use across our operations and value chain by 2025. Suppliers are requested to report on facility-
level water consumption, water sources, water use management, potential water-stress risks, and wastewater management processes, on an annual basis. In FY22, our
manufacturing and processing water footprint was 11,087,765 m3 — a 23.9% reduction compared to FY20. This decrease was primarily driven by COVID-19-related
business impacts, such as production volumes decreasing by over 25.6% compared to FY20. We continue to measure success towards our water targets with the data
provided by suppliers (verified by third party) through the Higg Index Facility Environmental Module (FEM). In FY22, we expanded the rollout of the Sustainable Apparel
Coalition’s (SAC) Higg Index FEM to cover our broader supply chain and increased visibility of our supply chain’s environmental performance data. We collected data from
273 Tier 1 facilities, representing 92% of our supply chain spend — an increase from 77% last year.
Comment
Within the reporting facilities, 229 (87% of our business spend) have completed data verification by an SAC-approved third party. Based on the verified data, the reporting
facilities scored an average of 46 points across all sections, with an average of 59 points in the water management section.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
We collaborate with the Apparel Impact Institute to support our top raw material suppliers to establish water reduction roadmaps that focus on efficiency and optimization.
Impact of the engagement and measures of success
We continued our partnership with the Apparel Impact Institute (Aii) to pilot the Mill/Impact Program and roll out the Carbon Leadership Program. Through the Carbon
Leadership Program, we invested in technical support for each participating manufacturing facility to develop their bespoke 2025 and 2030 carbon and water reduction
roadmaps and clear action plans with near-, medium-, and long-term priorities that align with broader industry ambitions and best practices. We enrolled fabric mill and
vertically integrated facilities, representing approximately 45% of our raw material business spend, as well as strategic finished goods facilities into our first cohort of the
Program. In FY22, the nominated facilities set water reduction targets ranging up to 72% by 2030 against their 2019 baseline. Based on the developed roadmaps for the
nominated facilities, it is estimated that the aggregate annual carbon and water savings at the facility level will reach 800,000 tons of CO2 equivalent and 8 million m3 of
water, respectively, by the end of the decade. 
We are expanding the roll out of the Carbon Leadership Program to our broader supply chain to support our suppliers in setting science-backed energy, carbon, as well as
water targets and monitoring implementation. In FY20, we nominated Tier 2 fabric mills in the Aii Mill/Impact Program to help reduce their overall environmental impact,
including carbon, energy, and water use. In FY22, the mills completed an 18-month program focusing on efficiency and optimization. On average, the facilities completed
90% of all recommended measures, including 46 projects in total with an average investment payback period of 7.9 months. Through the completion of these optimization
projects, our facilities achieved an estimated annual total savings of 679,637 m3 of water and 80,489 tons of steam, in addition to reduced carbon emissions, and energy
consumption. 
In addition, we continued to collaborate directly with our manufacturers in improving water use efficiency. Since FY20, we have been working closely with our suppliers to
adopt more water-efficient processing for our materials and product manufacturing. These transitions have helped our suppliers avoid an estimated 169,992 cubic meters
of water use in FY22. We also continued to reduce the use of water-intensive chemicals and processing in the production of our core Polo and Lauren denim products.
Comment
Freshwater is an essential resource that the apparel industry is heavily reliant on — from growing cotton to dyeing and washing fabric. We commit to reducing water
consumption across our value chain to achieve at least 20% reduction in total water use across our operations and value chain by 2025, compared to FY20 baseline.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Each of our suppliers is required to sign our Vendor Compliance Packet (VCP) which details our code of conduct. This legal document also features our sustainability
policy. We incorporated our water stewardship commitment into our supply chain and materials sustainability policy which covers all suppliers and licensees.
Impact of the engagement and measures of success
The success of our water stewardship strategy requires engagement with our suppliers to manage and reduce water use in our supply chain. Through our Vendor
Compliance Packet (VCP), our suppliers are made aware of our sustainability policy, and are expected to comply with the requirements set therein as they sign the
agreement. We explicitly state in our Vendor Compliance and Operating Standards that all suppliers are required to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations of the
regions where they operate, including, but not limited to, the local environmental standards. We have the right to terminate our business relationship should the supplier fail
to comply with the applicable laws and regulations. 
In addition to that, we are screening our supply base for any potential significant environmental impacts through the Higg Index Facility Environmental Module and the
Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) Supervision platform (the latter is specific to China-based facilities). If an issue is found, we require the supplier to take
corrective action and put in place preventive measures to avoid recurrence. Specifically, on any violation record found on the IPE platform, we also require the facilities—at
a minimum—to publish enterprise feedback onto the platform, which details the corrective and preventive measures taken.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) aims to achieve mutual, long-term, positive impacts across our supply chain. This requires enduring partnerships based on
transparency and trust. The SES provides a framework for us in building and maintaining these partnerships. It enables us to develop performance-based supply chain
segmentation, as well as drive continuous improvement and positive impact that are based on shared transparency, accountability and value creation. In FY22, we
expanded our SES and supplier performance evaluation to all suppliers. We communicate our expectations of responsible practices with all suppliers, and seek feedback
from our strategic and key partners on their expectations of responsible purchasing practices. The sustainability performance is a contributor to the supplier’s overall
performance evaluation scorecard, which is used to inform business decisions and segmentation.
Impact of the engagement and measures of success
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) provides a framework for us to build and maintain mutual, long-term partnerships with our suppliers. The performance-based
supply chain segmentation takes into account the supplier’s performance in sustainability metrics, including climate, water stewardship, and sustainable chemicals
management. Our strategic and key supplier segments are held to a higher degree of expectations and are incentivized through growing business and transparency.
Currently, 53% of our business is with the strategic and key suppliers (21% of suppliers by number), and we are aiming to grow to 80% by 2025. We integrated
sustainability into our supplier performance evaluation scorecard where climate, water stewardship, and chemical management performance sit alongside other business-
critical issues such as quality. We rely on our partnership with the suppliers to drive reductions in our manufacturing water use. We also continue to invest in programs and
initiatives that support our supply partners in setting up and implementing a sustainability and water stewardship roadmap that aligns with or exceeds our goals.
Comment
W1.4c
(W1.4c) What is your organization’s rationale and strategy for prioritizing engagements with customers or other partners in its value chain?
 Our rationale for prioritizing engagements with value chain partners is to understand our water footprint and water risk assessment. Our strategy includes engagements with
manufacturing partners and local communities and entities where we operate. An example of this is our participation in WWF’s Noyyal-Bhavani Collective Action Program to
help address industry impacts on freshwater in the region. The goal of the program is that by 2030, the Noyyal and Bhavani sub-basins are healthy river ecosystems that
ensure water security for people and nature. We nominated six manufacturing facilities in the area to identify opportunities to improve their efficiency in energy and water use.
Success in this program is measured based on achievement of WWF’s three objectives for the collective action program: to assess the interactions and trade-offs between
users and sectors in representative zones of the Bhavani and Noyyal river basin; to demonstrate pilots in key sites to strengthen the positive interactions leading to healthy
river ecosystems and water security; and to influence sectoral, local, regional and national policies that deliver on a shared vision and outcomes for sustainable river basin
management.
We are also investing in engagement with U.S. cotton farmers through the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund (USRCF) led by the Soil Health Institute (SHI), who works with
growers to support adoption of soil health management systems, including practices such as cover crops and reduced tillage, across more than 1 million acres of U.S. cotton
cropland. The founding investment in USRCF from The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation enables SHI to accelerate and scale these efforts to reach farmers in a way they
haven’t before. Success is measured through increased adoption of soil health practices by cotton producers in the U.S. and associated improvements in key soil health
metrics as tracked by SHI.

We evaluated the impacts of cotton farming. We looked at our key cotton growing regions through the WWF Water Risk Filter to identify geographies with high risk for water
scarcity. We also estimated total water use (rainfed and irrigated) in cotton agriculture. We also used our store locations to estimate water use and scarcity risks associated
with product use, including customer water use for washing.
W3.3b
(W3.3b) Describe your organization’s process for identifying, assessing, and responding to water-related risks within your direct operations and other stages of
your value chain.
Ralph Lauren leverages the WWF Water Risk filter to assess basin and operational risk in our manufacturing supply chain across three dimensions: physical risk, regulatory
risk, and reputational risk. This assessment enables us to better understand the type of physical risks such as scarcity, flooding, quality, and ecosystem services status risks,
as well as regulatory and reputational risks facing manufacturing sites, as well as the scale of these risks, based on basin location as well as business activities including
manufacturing and processing. Specifically, this assessment examines both water availability and water quality at the basin/catchment level and takes into account
employees, local communities, suppliers, and other water users at the basin or catchment level as stakeholder groups to provide a comprehensive picture of physical risk, as
manufacturing processes across our value chain depend on both sufficient amounts of water and water of sufficient quality. Water regulatory frameworks can also impact
water availability, cost, and use and discharge requirements across our value chain, so this contextual issue and regulators as a stakeholder group are considered as well.
Stakeholder conflicts concerning water resources and access to WASH services can be a driver of reputational risk, so this contextual issue is also considered. This approach
helps inform internal decision-making processes by providing a lens through which we identify priority basins and priority sites, as well as a framework for determining the
most appropriate and impactful actions that our company may undertake or invest in to address contextual water risk, such as conservation initiatives, nature-based solutions,
operational practice improvements, and sourcing strategy.

(W4.1a) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
In our corporate Enterprise Risk Management process, risks rating criteria are used to assess the extent to which a risk event may affect the company’s strategy, finances,
operations, and/or reputation. Substantive financial or strategic impact is defined as any risks rated as ‘critical’ or ‘high’. A ‘critical’ risk is defined as having one or more of the
following impacts: (1) a very high impact on the company’s ability to meet strategic goals or execute priority initiatives; (2) leading to greater than $700 million impact on
revenue or $70 million impact on our operating margin; (3) a national, sustained, negative reputational damage with stakeholders; or (4) leading to severe and potentially long-
term impact on the operations of our business. A ‘high’ risk is defined as having one or more of the following impacts: (1) a high impact on the company’s ability to meet
strategic goals or execute priority initiatives; (2) leading to between $350 million and $700 million impact on revenue or between $35 million and $70 million impact on our
operating margin; (3) a national, short-term, negative reputational damage with stakeholders; or (4) leading to significant impact on the operations of our business. Risks and

The basins identified as having very high risk could potentially face disruptions in manufacturing activities due to water related issues. This however could be mitigated
through our company’s sourcing strategy, therefore the magnitude of potential impact is rated as medium-low.
Primary response to risk
Upstream Other, please specify (Ralph Lauren takes a holistic approach to water stewardship. We are committed to reducing water consumption across our value chain and to safeguarding and preserving
water resources in our communities.)
Description of response
We are committed to reducing water consumption across our value chain and to safeguarding and preserving water resources in our communities. We have a public goal to
achieve at least a 20% reduction in total water use across our operations and value chain by 2025. We collaborate with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to advance our work in
this area and set a comprehensive strategy for water stewardship and water use reductions in our value chain. We believe a contextual water target approach is important
to better align our reduction goals with the water challenges in our value chain. In priority water-stressed locations, including in India, we are contributing to collective action
programs with WWF, local partners, and experts to scale water use assessments and support watershed health through conservation interventions, including wetland
restoration, stakeholder engagement, as well as the adoption of preferable land use management practices. 
We are also working to eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals in our production by 2025. We monitor our suppliers’ conformance to the ZDHC MRSL, and require our
suppliers to conduct wastewater tests aligned with ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines that require no hazardous chemicals are discharged through wastewater. 
On innovation, we are developing water-related innovation through the Color on Demand technology platform, which aims to optimize cotton dyeing and enable up to 40
percent less water use compared to traditional cotton dyeing processes. In FY22, we launched an open-source ECOFAST™ manual in collaboration with Dow to support
faster adoption of an improved dyeing process. 
Globally, one in three people do not have access to safe drinking water. We are working to help end this disparity by supporting organizations providing clean water sources
for those in need. As part of this effort, we continued our partnerships with organizations focused on community access and WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene)
solutions, based on local needs. In 2022, the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation launched a year-long partnership with WaterAid, empowering women in Budhni, India, to
make access to WASH services a reality. Our partnership with WaterAid aims to bring clean water systems, hygiene and menstrual hygiene education to 25,000 people in
Budhni homes, schools and healthcare centers. It also aims to deliver essential WASH services to factories in coordination with another Company partner, HERproject™.
Cost of response
Explanation of cost of response
The cost of response remains unknown as we are tackling the issues holistically, and our value chain partners where our water risks predominantly lie, are implementing
water-related initiatives as an investment inherent to their business and corporate strategy.

Risks exist, but
no substantive
impact
anticipated
Currently, we have not identified water risks in our direct operations with the potential to have substantive or strategic impact, considering the use of freshwater in Ralph Lauren’s own and
operated facilities does not represent high water intensity and freshwater use is not a significant business critical function within our own and operated facilities. Within our own operations,
Ralph Lauren stores and offices largely occupy leased, multi-tenant buildings, and mainly use water for drinking and sanitation purposes.

Company-specific description & strategy to realize opportunity
Ralph Lauren is working with product manufacturers to use more water-efficient production methods and to capture water data through the Sustainable Apparel Coalition
Higg Index Facility Environment Module. In FY22, we continued our partnership with the Apparel Impact Institute (Aii) to roll out the Carbon Leadership Program within our
supply chain. Through the Program, we invested in technical support for each participating manufacturing facility to develop their bespoke 2025 and 2030 carbon and water
reduction roadmaps and clear action plans with near-, medium- and long-term priorities that align with broader industry ambitions and best practices, which is of strategic
interest to our business in the face of climate change and water risk. In FY22, nominated facilities set water reduction targets ranging up to 72% by 2030 against their 2019
baseline. Based on the developed roadmaps for the nominated facilities, it is estimated that the aggregate annual carbon and water savings at the facility level will reach
800,000 tons of CO2 equivalent and 8 million m3 of water, respectively, by the end of the decade. 
We will continue to expand the rollout of the program in our supply chain and work closely with our suppliers to track progress and support them in capability building and
collective action programs that help overcome obstacles in implementing their action plan. In FY20, we enrolled five Tier 2 fabric mills in the Aii Mill/Impact Program to help
reduce their overall environmental impact, including carbon and energy use. In FY22, they completed an 18-month program focusing on efficiency and optimization. On
average, the facilities completed 90% of all recommended measures, including 46 projects in total with an average investment payback period of 7.9 months. Through the
completion of these optimization projects, our facilities achieved an estimated annual total savings of 679,637 m3 of water, 80,489 tons of steam, as well as energy and
carbon.

roadmaps and clear action plans with near-, medium and long-term priorities that align with broader industry ambitions and best practices, which is of strategic interest to
our business in the face of climate change and water risk. These initiatives aim to help reduce our supply chain’s reliance on freshwater resources, hence increasing our
supply chain resilience, considering some of our manufacturing facilities are located in regions with high water scarcity risk. For raw materials, we evaluated the impacts of
cotton farming as part of our water stewardship strategy, so this is of strategic interest to our business. Cotton accounts for more than 80 percent of our total material use.
We looked at our key cotton growing regions through the WWF Water Risk Filter to identify geographies with high risk for water scarcity. We also estimated total water use
(rainfed and irrigated) in cotton agriculture—the volume used is significant and our focus is on both reducing water use in cotton production and increasing effectiveness of
water use. A key driver of this is the adoption of regenerative farming practices that make better use of rainfall and irrigated land. These practices increase soil fertility,
water holding capacity and carbon capture; reduce erosion and pollution runoff; and create more resilience against floods and droughts. Our company also has a goal to
have 100% of our cotton be sustainably sourced by 2025. In FY22, the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation and the Soil Health Institute (SHI) announced a founding grant
to launch the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund, a unique, farmer-facing, science-based initiative that will support long-term, sustainable cotton production in the United States.

New R&D opportunities
Company-specific description & strategy to realize opportunity
Ralph Lauren is committed to industry partnerships and investing in scalable, innovative technologies that enable further efficiencies in processes, material usage, water,
and energy consumption. These initiatives help unlock opportunities in our value chain to reduce reliance in freshwater resources while also offering innovative products to
our customers. Our water stewardship strategy includes development of low impact products and materials. We are currently working to increase the use of recycled
content for both synthetic and natural fibers. Our strategy also includes the use of regeneratively grown fibers and materials to support soil health. In FY22, 76% of our units
produced met at least one of our sustainable material criteria—up from 33% in FY21. Last year we announced a comprehensive circularity strategy to further advance
sustainability goals. We’re working on using the principles of Cradle to Cradle® (C2C) as foundational inspiration for design, development, manufacturing, packaging and
the post-sale experience. In FY22, we began working on our first C2C-certified product, a luxury cashmere sweater. We also plan to continue investing in scalable
technologies that will elevate the quality of recycled materials. In 2020, Ralph Lauren invested in Natural Fiber Welding (NFW), a leading sustainable material science
startup that is scaling a new industry standard for natural fiber recycling. Our partnership with NFW was on display at the 2022 Australian Open with the launch of the RLX
CLARUS® Polo Shirt. It marked the unveiling of a first-to-market patented platform that transforms virgin and recycled cotton in ways previously not possible. The shirt
features a high-performance cotton that performs similarly to plastic-based synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon, but without the use of petroleum-based fossil fuels. We
began integrating Color on Demand into our supply chain in FY22 and first launched product utilizing ECOFAST™ Pure as part of the Team USA collection for the Olympic
& Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020. By releasing a detailed manual on how to dye cotton more sustainably and more effectively using ECOFAST™, we are open-sourcing
this improved dyeing process to encourage adoption in the textile industry. We will continue to work with our suppliers to adopt these practices. As we develop new and
expanded circular and low impact products, this could result in a competitive advantage, brand preference, and brand loyalty among customers.

Ralph Lauren takes a holistic approach to water stewardship. We are committed to reducing water consumption across our value chain and to safeguarding and preserving
water resources in our communities. Our water stewardship strategy is aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement, the UN Global Compact and SDG6. We have a public goal to
achieve at least a 20% reduction in total water use across our operations and value chain by 2025. Our water stewardship work is built upon three pillars: Conservation, Cotton,
and Community. We collaborate with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to advance our work in this area and set a comprehensive strategy for water stewardship and water use
reductions in our value chain. We are also working to eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals in our production by 2025. We monitor our suppliers’ conformance to the ZDHC
MRSL and require our suppliers to conduct wastewater tests aligned with ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines that require no hazardous chemicals are discharged through
wastewater. We incorporated suppliers’ water, chemical, and wastewater management KPIs in our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) and supplier scorecard that informs
the supplier segmentation and business (procurement) decisions. These KPIs are considered alongside other KPIs such as climate, citizenship, business execution, and
quality. We collaborate with our suppliers through the Aii Carbon Leadership Program to develop roadmap for climate and water impact reduction, as both issues are correlated
and have synergies through facility-level efficiency improvement. 
On innovation, we are developing water-related innovation through the Color on Demand technology platform, which aims to optimize cotton dyeing and enable up to 40
percent less water use compared to traditional cotton dyeing processes. 
In communities worldwide, access to safe water remains a challenge; globally, one in three people do not have access to safe drinking water. We are working to help end this
disparity by supporting organizations providing clean water sources for those in need. As part of this effort, we continued our partnerships with organizations focused on
community access and WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) solutions, based on local needs.

Ralph Lauren’s Global Citizenship & Sustainability governance is integrated across all levels of our organization. Our Board of Directors is responsible for formal governance of
Global Citizenship & Sustainability. The Nominating, Governance, Citizenship and Sustainability Committee of the Board oversees our environmental, social and governance
(ESG) risks and opportunities; receives quarterly updates; reviews initiatives, goals, and policies; and makes recommendations to the Board on ESG matters. We regularly
conduct materiality assessments to help identify and prioritize the citizenship and sustainability issues, risks, and opportunities that matter most to our business and stakeholders,
including water-related issues. Within our governance structure, we have created the Water Stewardship Working Group, dedicated to driving progress on our water stewardship
commitment and KPIs. In terms of long-term business objectives, we have set our water-related commitment across our material and finished goods manufacturing, supply chain,
and direct operations. Our goal is to achieve at least a 20 percent reduction in total water use across our operations and value chain compared to a FY20 baseline by 2025. In our
strategic business growth plan, we integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business principles and use sustainability KPIs as one of the metrics for measuring the success
of our long-term business objectives.

Building resilience across our value chain is important for our long-term business objectives. Our approach to water stewardship includes actions that address overall water use
and quality, protecting watersheds, and seeking to ensure water access at the community level. We set medium- to long-term goals for climate and water, which we believe align
our trajectory towards our long-term objectives. We are taking the contextual water target approach and investing in collective action programs to scale water conservation efforts.
In FY22, we joined WWF’s Noyyal-Bhavani Collective Action Program to help address industry impacts on freshwater in the region. We nominated six manufacturing facilities in the
area to identify opportunities to improve their efficiency in energy and water use. We monitor our broader supply chain water performance through the Higg FEM and collaborate
with the Aii to identify opportunities for efﬁciency with regard to energy, chemical, and water use. We also adopted the ZDHC MRSL, and collaborate with industry to eliminate the
use and discharge of hazardous chemicals across the apparel supply chain. Our raw material water strategy includes accelerating the adoption of regenerative cotton farming
practices and working towards achieving 100% sustainably sourced cotton by 2025. We also plan to invest in scalable, innovative technologies that enable further efficiencies in
processes, materials, water, and energy consumption.

a new system composed of a set of technologies that enables the recycling and reuse of all
water from the dyeing process, establishing the world’s first scalable zero wastewater cotton
dyeing system. As part of the first phase of Color on Demand, Ralph Lauren optimized the
use of ECOFAST™ Pure Sustainable Textile Treatment, a pre-treatment solution developed
by Dow for cotton textiles. When used with existing dyeing equipment, ECOFAST™ Pure
enables the use of up to 40% less water and 85% fewer chemicals compared to traditional
cotton dyeing processes.
<Not Applicable> We’re working on applying the principles of Cradle to Cradle® (C2C) as

Ralph Lauren’s Global Citizenship & Sustainability governance, targets, and goals are integrated across all levels of our organization. We regularly conduct materiality assessments to
help identify and prioritize the citizenship and sustainability issues, risks, and opportunities that matter most to our business and stakeholders. We are committed to reducing water
consumption across our value chain and to safeguard and preserve water resources in our communities. To achieve this commitment, our water stewardship strategy consists of three
pillars: 1) CONSERVATION - Safeguard and preserve water resources where we operate through contextual water targets and collective action program implementation in priority
geographies with high water stress. 2) COTTON - Sustainably-source cotton and accelerate the adoption of regenerative farming practices. 3) COMMUNITY - Partner with
organizations focused on watershed health and community WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) solutions. As part of our water stewardship strategy, we also aim to eliminate the
use of hazardous chemicals in our supply chain as part of our sustainable chemicals management work to minimize the impact of water and environmental pollution in our
manufacturing geographies. Each of these ambitions is incorporated across our business operations through the relevant department’s goals and KPIs, and tracked on a quarterly
basis at minimum. Under our governance structure, we have created a cross-functional Water Stewardship Working Group, dedicated to driving progress on our water stewardship
commitment and KPIs. They provide a progress report to our Global Citizenship & Sustainability Steering Committee on a quarterly basis. Our Global Citizenship & Sustainability
Steering Committee is chaired by our Chief Global Impact & Communications Officer and includes leaders from across the Company. The Steering Committee meets monthly to
review progress, prioritize our approach, and allocate resources. Our Nominating, Governance & Sustainability committee of our Board of Directors has oversight of companywide
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies and initiatives. The committee receives quarterly updates; reviews initiatives, goals, and policies; and makes recommendations
to the Board on ESG matters. Our Board of Directors (the Board) is responsible for formal governance of Global Citizenship & Sustainability. The full Board receives a report on
citizenship and sustainability progress, including water-related issues, at least once annually and reviews the Company’s annual Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report.

We continued our partnership with Aii to pilot the Mill/Impact Program and roll out the Carbon Leadership Program. We enrolled fabric mill and vertically integrated facilities,
representing approximately 45% of our raw material business spend, as well as strategic finished goods facilities into our first cohort of the Program. In FY22, the
nominated facilities set water reduction targets ranging up to 72% by 2030 against their 2019 baseline. Based on the developed roadmaps for the nominated facilities, it is
estimated that the aggregate annual carbon and water savings at the facility level will reach 800,000 tons of CO2 equivalent and 8 million m3 of water, respectively, by the
end of the decade. We are expanding the roll out of the Carbon Leadership Program to broader supply chain. In FY20, we nominated Tier 2 fabric mills in the Aii Mill/Impact
Program to help reduce their overall environmental impact, including carbon, energy, and water use. In FY22, the mills completed an 18-month program focusing on
efficiency and optimization. On average, the facilities completed 90% of all recommended measures, including 46 projects in total with an average investment payback
period of 7.9 months. Through the completion of these optimization projects, our facilities achieved an estimated annual total savings of 679,637 m3 of water and 80,489

As part of our water stewardship strategy, we looked at our key cotton growing regions through the WWF Water Risk Filter to identify geographies with high risk for water
scarcity. We also estimated total water use (rainfed and irrigated) in cotton agriculture and we are working to reduce water use in cotton production and increase water use
effectiveness. A key driver of this is the adoption of regenerative farming practices, which increase soil fertility, water holding capacity and carbon capture; reduce erosion
and pollution runoff; and create more resilience against floods and droughts. In the U.S., the USRCF led by SHI works with growers to support adoption of soil health
management systems, including practices such as cover crops and reduced tillage, across more than 1 million acres of U.S. cotton cropland. The founding investment in
USRCF from The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation enables SHI to accelerate and scale these efforts to reach farmers in a way they haven’t before. 
In FY22, we continued our transition to sustainable cotton for apparel products and Ralph Lauren Home transitioned 95% of core bedding and bath and new fashion
bedding to cotton qualities we recognize as sustainable, such as organic or Better Cotton. In 2021, we sourced more than 19,000 metric tons of cotton lint as Better Cotton,
while supporting the not-for-profit’s holistic efforts to make cotton a more climate-resilient, socially-viable and, ultimately, more sustainable crop.
