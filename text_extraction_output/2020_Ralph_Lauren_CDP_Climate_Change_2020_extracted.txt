Ralph Lauren Corporation - Climate Change 2020
C0. Introduction
C0.1
(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
Founded in 1967 by Mr. Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Corporation is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products in five categories:
apparel, footwear & accessories, home furnishings, fragrances and hospitality. For more than 50 years, our reputation and distinctive image have been consistently developed
across an expanding number of products, brands and international markets. Our brand names, which include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren Purple
Label, Polo Ralph Lauren, Double RL, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, Chaps and Club Monaco, among others, constitute one of the world’s most widely
recognized families of consumer brands. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across an expanding number of products, brands, sales
channels, and international markets. We believe that our global reach, breadth of product offerings, and multi-channel distribution are unique among luxury and apparel
companies.
Our global reach is extensive, as we sell directly to customers throughout the world via our 530 retail stores and 654 concession-based shop-within-shops, as well as through
our own digital commerce sites and those of various third-party digital partners. Merchandise is also available through our wholesale distribution channels at over 11,000
doors worldwide, the majority in specialty stores, as well as through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers. In addition to our directly-operated stores
and shops, our international licensing partners operate 80 Ralph Lauren stores, 31 Ralph Lauren concession shops, and 139 Club Monaco stores and shops.
For more than 50 years, Ralph Lauren has inspired the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style, and we approach citizenship & sustainability with this in
mind. This core purpose informs our every day at Ralph Lauren and extends across our entire business. It is inextricably linked to how we create a better future for our
Company, the people we come into contact with and the world.
One year ago, we launched our renewed citizenship and sustainability strategy, Design the Change. Our strategy was built on the values and purpose that have defined our
business for more than half a century, and it is based on our belief that, together with our industry, we can deliver the change required to create a positive impact in society
and a more sustainable future. 
When we set out on our journey to Design the Change, we set ambitious goals and dedicated ourselves to integrating our strategy into every part of our business with a clear
focus on three pillars: Creating Timeless Style, Protecting the Environment and Championing Better Lives.
We are one year into our journey and while we, along with the world, face an unprecedented challenge and global crisis, we are optimistic about the future and are committed
to doing what we can to create a better tomorrow.
Design the Change accelerates our work across Global Citizenship & Sustainability. Fundamentally, we believe that, together with our industry, we can deliver the change
required to create a positive impact in society and a more sustainable future. In June 2019, Ralph Lauren signed onto the United Nations Global Compact, joining other
companies across industries committed to implementing universal sustainability principles. 
Through Design the Change we:
Create Timeless Style: We believe one of our greatest commitments to sustainability is designing products worn and loved and made to last. We are committed to
responsible sourcing and using state-of-the-art materials that allow us to create our products more sustainably, without compromising the quality we’re known for.
Protect the Environment: We’re using partnerships and technology to reduce the environmental impact of our operations and supply chain across energy, emissions, water
and waste. We believe collaboration is key to finding solutions, which is why we joined leading groups and support nonprofits dedicated to mitigating the environmental
impacts of business.
Champion Better Lives: We aim to positively affect the lives of those touched by our business, including people in our communities, workforce and supply chain.
Risks and opportunities described herein with the potential to have a ‘substantive financial or strategic impact on our business’ are not necessarily ‘material’ to investors as
defined by the SEC.
CDP system functionality only allows for 365 days to be reflected in the start and end date fields below. The results contained in this CDP survey are for Ralph Lauren’s fiscal
year 2020 (March 31, 2019 through March 28, 2020), which consisted of 363 days.

(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
Substantive impact is defined as an activity which has significant impact to our public image and significant decrease in stakeholder satisfaction. Specifically, this is
considered to be when risks are found to have potential for severe impacts on our operations in the next 5+ years, leading to $1 billion impact on revenue or $100 million
impact on our operating margin. Risks and opportunities described herein with the potential to have a ‘substantive financial or strategic impact on our business’ are not
necessarily ‘material’ to investors as defined by the SEC.

Description of process
Ralph Lauren’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process is used to identify and plan responses to ensure the health and life of the business enterprise and successfully
prepare our company to face any risk event, including those presented by climate change. Our ERM process currently involves identifying broad ESG sustainability risks,
creating rankings of importance for each risk, and creating mitigation plans for certain risks. We primarily focus on risks within each fiscal year, rather than long-term risks.
As part of this annual ERM assessment, our Senior Vice President for Internal Audit & Asset Protection initiates this process by meeting with leadership of different
business units (e.g., Chief Supply Chain Officer, Chief Sustainability Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, etc.) and gathers list of risks that each business unit has identified.
From this full list, our ERM team conducts an exercise to rank risks based on the perceived potential impact of each risk and the company’s vulnerability to that risk. This
ranking is benchmarked against the previous year’s ERM results and discuss with business unit managers to fine-tune these rankings. For each risk identified, the ERM
team works with business unit leaders to create mitigation plans for each risk. For ESG risks, this involves engaging our Chief Sustainability Officer to develop mitigation
plans on ESG risks, including those related to climate change. For top risks, our Senior Vice President for Internal Audit & Asset Protection assigns a risk owner to manage
the risk and report to the Board of Directors quarterly. The Board of Directors receives a quarterly update on progress managing the risks identified. For ESG risks identified
as part of ERM that require a more granular assessment process, such as climate change, we conduct an additional, detailed risk assessment process. To more fully
assess climate change risks and opportunities, our sustainability team conducted workshop discussions with subject matter experts across our business and operations to
characterize risk and opportunity drivers, time horizons, likelihood, and the relative magnitude of potential impacts. These subject matter experts include leaders of our
teams focused on logistics, sourcing, raw materials, product innovation, sustainability, supply chain operations, risk management, asset protection, procurement, finance,
communications, legal, and investor relations.

assessment process. An example of a current regulatory risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is the move to low-Sulphur
fuel oil (LSFO) across the globe mandated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and all its member countries. LSFO is a higher-grade fuel, so it costs more to refine and
therefore could cause an abrupt shift in energy costs, impacting our costs for shipping goods.

assessment process. An example of a technology risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is deploying technologies
necessary for achieving our greenhouse gas reduction commitments. We are investing in technologies that will allow us to reduce the carbon footprint of our products and supply chain in
order to achieve our greenhouse gas reduction target. For example, in 2020 we announced a minority investment in Natural Fiber Welding, Inc. (NFW), a leading sustainable material
science startup that has revolutionized the reuse of natural fibers – such as cotton waste – into patented, high-performance materials.

Company-specific description
An increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events could affect Ralph Lauren’s supply chain, including raw material providers, factories, and logistics. Weather
events that cause manufacturing infrastructure damage and flooding cause disruptions in timing throughout the supply chain that can affect revenue by decreasing
production capacity and reliability and increasing wages and fuel prices, which could result in higher manufacturing costs. Additionally, we rely upon third-party
transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution centers, to our stores and shop-within-shops, and to
our digital commerce and wholesale customers. Our utilization of these shipping services are subject to various risks, including severe weather caused by climate change.

Company-specific description
The facilities operated by Ralph Lauren may have their insurance premium or classification changed as a result of exposure to increasingly frequent and severe extreme
weather events. This may happen before Ralph Lauren incurs losses from extreme weather events. As storms become more frequent and severe and higher than average
rainfall occurs, this will typically contribute to insurance premium increases. Many of Ralph Lauren’s stores and operations sit in high wind, high flood regions and are
exposed to the risk of increased premiums and reduced coverage availability.

the local economies affected, as well as of the regional and global economies. Any of these events could result in decreased demand for our products and disruptions in our
sales channels and manufacturing and distribution networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Additionally, as storms become more severe and higher than average rainfall occurs as a result of climate change, the facilities operated by Ralph Lauren may have to
spend more to protect from storm-related damage and losses.

few years back to come into effect on 1 January 2020. LSFO is a higher-grade fuel, so it costs more to refine. LSFO is also part of the middle distillates range and so
competes with more widely used fuels for other transportation modes etc. There is a refining imbalance that will need to shift from HSFO to LSFO as demand shifts, so
there is a risk of a price spike due to supply/demand imbalance risk as well as price increase due to higher refining costs. While not an unexpected impact to the industry it
can cause an abrupt shift in energy costs.

(C3.1a) Does your organization use climate-related scenario analysis to inform its strategy?
No, but we anticipate using qualitative and/or quantitative analysis in the next two years
C3.1c
(C3.1c) Why does your organization not use climate-related scenario analysis to inform its strategy?
Ralph Lauren has not used climate-related scenario analysis because this type of analysis is not yet incorporated into our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process,
which is used to inform our business strategy. Our ERM process currently involves identifying broad ESG sustainability risks, creating rankings of importance for each risk,
and creating mitigation plans for certain risks. We primarily focus on risks within each fiscal year, rather than long-term risks. We have previously considered this process to
accurately inform our business strategy in relation to sustainability risks; however, we have begun the process of making changes to account for more long-term and/or
climate-specific risk evaluation and management. By following the scenario analysis approach, our ERM process will become more granular (currently each risk is considered
within one “ESG” risk) and will more formally integrate longer-term risks (these longer-term risks are currently evaluated most intensively outside of the formal ERM process).
As a result, we are currently working to refine our Enterprise Risk Management process to include a qualitative climate-related scenario analysis in our next annual risk
management assessment. We plan to work with a third-party to implement climate-related scenario analysis in the coming fiscal year and then make this a standard part of
our risk management process further into the future.

We take a holistic approach to sourcing preferred fibers and materials for our products, including the consideration of climate-related risks and opportunities. As part of our company
sustainability initiative we’re evaluating the following: • efficient production and processing techniques to reduce emissions and energy usage • use of existing waste feedstocks for
recycled materials while reducing our reliance on virgin synthetics • supporting conservation efforts of intact forest ecosystems through strategic viscose and paper sourcing practices •
materials that are produced in a manner that supports better land management, such as BCI cotton, by reducing pesticide use and soil erosion.

chain
Yes
In FY20, we launched our new Supplier Engagement Strategy to establish and maintain collaborative partnerships and systems that foster increased transparency and accountability.
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy is built on our long-term strategic approach for value creation. Our segmentation principles and criteria are based on business execution, citizenship
and sustainability, and product integrity. Our sustainability criteria include considerations that can be used in the future to mitigate risks from climate change in our supply base. For
example, we strive for geographical diversity in our key and strategic suppliers, which will support our efforts to mitigate the risk of disruptions in our supply chain from climate change.
We set a science-based target to reduce our absolute GHG emissions across our entire scope 1, 2 and 3 footprint. We are also engaging our strategic and key suppliers through Higg
Index Facility Environmental Module (FEM) to monitor their energy use and emissions data and drive improvement. In addition to this, we supported our largest fabric manufacturers to
participate in the Mill impact Initiative run by the Apparel Impact Institute (Aii). The Initiative applies Clean by Design methodology and drives the reduction of environmental impacts in
the manufacturing process, including carbon, water and chemical footprint of textile production.
Investment
in R&D
Yes
Our Product and Business Model Innovation Teams invest and drive adoption of technologies and platforms that reduce the use of virgin raw materials, increase energy and resource
use efficiency and prolong the life and durability of our products. This includes a minority investment in Natural Fiber Welding, Inc. (NFW), a leading sustainable material science startup
that has revolutionized the reuse of natural fibers – such as cotton waste – into patented, high-performance materials. Other examples of this include: clothing rental programs, products
that use recycled content and manufacturing processes and technologies that significantly reduce water, energy and other resource inputs.
Operations Yes
We have set a target to source 100% renewable electricity by 2025. We anticipate sourcing a portion of our electricity through long-term power purchase agreements for renewable
power. We expect that this strategy will reduce potential impacts from future carbon pricing and volatile conventional electricity prices.

We have operations, including retail, distribution, and warehousing operations, in locations subject to natural disasters, such as severe weather caused by climate change, any of which could
disrupt our operations. As storms become more severe and higher than average rainfall occurs as a result of climate change, the facilities operated by Ralph Lauren may have to spend more to
protect from storm-related damage and losses. To plan for these expected costs, our Asset Protection team meets monthly to conduct exercises on potential disruptions to our operations,
including those related to climate change. As a result of those exercises, the Asset Protection team identifies anticipated costs resulting from those disruptions and develops strategies to mitigate
those costs. For example, extreme weather events sometimes require deploying window boards and sandbags to prevent damage to our facilities. We have conducted exercises to quantify the
anticipated costs of these protection measures and approaches for reducing costs in the future (e.g., storing and re-deploying window boards). Additionally, in order to meet our commitment to
source 100% renewable electricity in our direct operations by 2025, we have conducted detailed analyses of strategic pathways for renewable power sourcing. Many of these approaches, such
as virtual power purchase agreements, involve modeling projections of anticipated power costs or savings which we are incorporating into our broader financial planning.

Please explain (including target coverage)
In FY20, we established a science-based target to reduce our absolute GHG emissions by 30 percent by 2030, compared to 2020 levels. This target includes reducing
emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity and reducing emissions from our supply chain (Scope 3). Our goal was
approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), indicating that our ambitions align with reduction pathways to limit global temperature rise across the planet to
1.5°C. The goal is consistent with our commitment as a signatory to the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action to achieve a 30 percent aggregate GHG emission
reductions in scope 1, 2 and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standard by 2030, against a baseline of no earlier than 2015. The goal is also consistent with our
membership in RE100. Setting a value chain carbon reduction target is a significant milestone for Ralph Lauren. We believe that companies must establish ambitious,
science-based targets to ensure that society averts the disruptive effects of climate change. Our commitment represents our long-standing values, reflects the evolution of
our thinking and will help decarbonize the fashion industry. We are working on a detailed plan to implement our goal by sourcing renewable energy for our operations and
reducing the carbon intensity of manufacturing and production in our supply chain.

Emissions calculation methodology
Emissions from the Purchased Goods and Services are the largest contributor to Ralph Lauren’s Scope 3 footprint and comprise 2/3 of the total Scope 3 footprint.
Emissions in this category were comprised of three main elements: raw materials, factory emissions, and other non-merch spend. Raw material weights were gathered and
appropriate MSI Higg emission factors were used to find raw material emissions. Higg FEM factory energy data was gathered from 2018 and processed to find emissions
from verified sources associated with Ralph Lauren (using a percentage of production for each factory dedicated to Ralph Lauren). An outlier process then cleaned the data
and then the data was scaled up to account for all factories in Ralph Lauren’s supply chain. Finally, spend on other non-merch goods and services was classified by
category according to Defra spend emission factors and emissions were calculated.

Emissions calculation methodology
Use of Sold Products emissions were calculated by first classifying the number of units sold by Ralph Lauren in the reporting year into various categories, such as dress
shirts, knits, or baby accessories. Then, each unit sold was given an average kWh/lifetime value due to washing, drying, and ironing (if applicable) by assuming its weight,
the energy use of the average appliance, and the lifespan of the product. These energy values were converted to emissions using average emission factors for each split-
out region (North America, Asia, and Europe) and the emissions were applied to each product category. Note than many goods sold by Ralph Lauren are not washed, dried,
or ironed, so there are no emissions associated with them in this category.

End of Life emissions were calculated using the raw material data that was obtained earlier for the Purchased Goods and Services category. These emissions were found
by taking the total weight of each raw material and assuming that it goes 100% to landfill at the end of its life. A clothing to landfill emissions factor was used from Defra
2019.

Due to improvements in our carbon footprinting methodology for FY20, comparisons to FY19 show a large increase in intensity. Our previous footprint did not account for all
of our owned and operated facilities and energy use, and our carbon accounting system did not allow for easy recalculation of previous years. Therefore, FY20 has far
higher intensity of emissions per revenue due to the footprint’s increasingly comprehensive nature.

Due to improvements in our carbon footprinting methodology for FY20, comparisons to FY19 show a large increase in intensity. Our previous footprint did not account for all
of our owned and operated facilities and energy use, and our carbon accounting system did not allow for easy recalculation of previous years. There were errors in the
square footage accounting as well last year which were fixed in a comprehensive data gathering process in FY20. Because of this, even though sites were added to the
footprint, other values were fixed and the square footage remained about constant, despite the greatly increased energy use and resulting emissions. Therefore, FY20 has
far higher intensity of emissions per square foot due to the footprint’s increasingly comprehensive nature.

We are signatories to the We Are Still In declaration and the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, pledging to limit our emissions in line with the Paris Agreement
goals. We are also members of the G7 Fashion Pact, a group of fashion leaders working to stop global warming, restore biodiversity and protect the oceans. As part of our
carbon reduction strategy, we joined RE100 and committed to the goal of powering our owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100 percent
renewable electricity by 2025.
To help us sustainably source our cotton, we became members of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) in support of their mission to address the environmental, social and
economic issues associated with growing cotton. In 2019, we sourced 6,500 tonnes of Better Cotton, which is equivalent to an estimated 8 percent of our total cotton use.
We are members of the Clean Cargo working group, working with cargo carriers and freight forwarders to reduce the environmental impacts of global goods transportation
and to promote responsible shipping. We also engage with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency SmartWay program on efficient logistics. In FY20, we signed the Ocean
Conservancy Arctic Shipping Pledge to protect the Arctic marine ecosystem from the negative impacts of commercial shipping. As a signatory, we commit not to hire carriers
to ship our products through Arctic Trans-Shipment Routes.
