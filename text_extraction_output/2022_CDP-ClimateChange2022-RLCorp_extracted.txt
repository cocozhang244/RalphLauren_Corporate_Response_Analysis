Ralph Lauren Corporation - Climate Change 2022
C0. Introduction
C0.1
(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
Founded in 1967 by Mr. Ralph Lauren, we are a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear,
accessories, home furnishings, fragrances, and hospitality. For more than 50 years, Ralph Lauren has sought to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and
timeless style. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products, brands, distribution channels, and international
markets. We believe that our global reach, breadth of lifestyle product offerings, and multi-channel distribution are unique among luxury and apparel companies. Our global
reach is extensive, as we sell directly to customers throughout the world via our 504 retail stores and 684 concession-based shop-within-shops, as well as through our own
digital commerce sites and those of various third-party digital partners. Merchandise is also available through our wholesale distribution channels at approximately 9,000
doors worldwide, the majority in specialty stores, as well as through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers. In addition to our directly operated stores
and shops, our international licensing partners operate 148 Ralph Lauren stores and shops. 
We’ve stood for values and things that last — things that are timeless and enduring; things to cherish as they age and that never fall out of style. This belief remains central to
who we are today. It is with this core belief that we have reimagined our pursuit of a more equitable and sustainable future. We are taking what it means to create timeless
style and creating a business and products that are not only enduring but can inspire the dream of a better life with a plan for a better future. We call this evolution Timeless by
Design. With Timeless by Design, we are taking our philosophy of creating products that are meant to be passed down through generations and applying it to everything that
we do — from how we make our products, to how we impact the Earth, and how we champion our people and our communities. Our Timeless by Design approach is
supported by three pillars: Create with Intent, Protect the Environment and Champion Better Lives. 
Create With Intent – We’ve always created products that are meant to be loved and passed down through generations. Now, we are making those pieces more responsibly:
with more sustainable materials, according to circular design principles, and by instilling cultural sustainability practices. By designing timelessness in from the start, we’ll
enable all our products to live on responsibly.
Protect The Environment – Creating timeless products goes beyond their design. It means creating them and operating our business in ways that respect our planet, such as
using renewable energy, managing our waste properly and using our water responsibly. By adopting practices that help preserve the world’s natural sources, we can be
stewards in protecting our environment for generations to come.
Champion Better Lives – Creating a business that is timeless and has a positive impact on tomorrow means building relationships that stand the test of time — ensuring
everyone is included, respected and empowered. That’s why we’re committed to supporting our employees, our partners and those within our communities today and working
to find more ways to help them build a brighter future.

(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
In our corporate Enterprise Risk Management process, risks rating criteria are used to assess the extent to which a risk event may affect the company’s strategy, finances,
operations, and/or reputation.  Substantive financial or strategic impact is defined as any risks rated as “critical” or “high”. A critical risk is defined as having one or more of the
following impacts: (1) a very high impact on the company’s ability to meet strategic goals or execute priority initiatives; (2) leading to greater than $700 million impact on
revenue or $70 million impact on our operating margin; (3) a national, sustained, negative reputational damage with stakeholders; or (4) leading to severe and potentially long-
term impact on the operations of our business. A “high” risk is defined as having one or more of the following impacts: (1) a high impact on the company’s ability to meet
strategy goals or execute priority initiatives; (2) leading to between $350 million and $700 million impact on revenue or between $35 million and $70 million impact on our
operating margin; (3) a national, short-term, negative reputational damage with stakeholders; or (4) leading to significant impact on the operations of our business. Risks and
opportunities described herein with the potential to have a "substantive financial or strategic impact on our business" are not necessarily "material" to investors as defined by
the SEC.

Description of process
Ralph Lauren’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process is used to identify and plan responses to ensure the health and life of the business enterprise and successfully
prepare our company to face any risk event, including those presented by climate change. Our ERM process currently involves identifying broad ESG sustainability risks,
creating rankings of importance for each risk, and creating mitigation plans for certain risks. We primarily focus on risks within each fiscal year, rather than long-term risks.
As part of this annual ERM assessment, our Senior Vice President for Internal Audit & Asset Protection initiates this process by meeting with leadership of different
business units (e.g., Chief Product Officer, Chief Global Impact & Communications Officer, etc.) and gathers a list of risks that each business unit has identified. From this
full list, our ERM team conducts an exercise to rank risks based on the perceived potential impact of each risk and the company’s vulnerability to that risk. This ranking is
benchmarked against the previous year’s ERM results and discussed with business unit managers to fine-tune these rankings. For each risk identified, the ERM team works
with business unit leaders to create mitigation plans for each risk. For ESG risks, this involves engaging our Chief Product Officer, Chief Global Impact & Communications
Officer to develop mitigation plans, including for those related to climate change. For top risks, our Senior Vice President for Internal Audit & Asset Protection assigns a risk

owner to manage the risk and report to the Board of Directors quarterly. Through the ERM process, climate change has been identified as an ESG risk that requires a more
granular assessment process. To conduct this detailed climate risk assessment, we created a cross-functional Ralph Lauren Climate Risk Taskforce, designed to make the
company more resilient to evolving risks presented by climate change. On a semiannual basis, the taskforce develops and updates a Climate Risk Report to: (1) identify key
climate risks; (2) describe the risks, the level of impact, and likelihood, and ensure key actions are being taken to address risks; and (3) communicate climate risks to key
stakeholders, including our leadership team and Board of Directors. The Climate Risk Taskforce is responsible for preparing the semiannual Climate Risk Report and for
developing inputs for other internal and external reporting on climate risk, including ERM and this CDP Climate Change questionnaire. The Taskforce includes
representatives from the following teams/business units: sustainability, internal audit/risk, logistics, sourcing, investor relations, store operations/asset protection, global risk,
communications, finance, legal, and worker well-being. The Climate Risk Report is reviewed by our Global Citizenship & Sustainability Steering Committee, who is
responsible for ensuring climate risk is built into our operating model and business strategy. The Climate Risk Report is then presented to the Board of Directors, where the
Nominating, Governance, Citizenship and Sustainability Committee is responsible for oversight of sustainability and ESG matters, including climate risk. To assess climate
risks, the Taskforce describes risks according to the following categories: where the risk occurs, risk type, risk driver, time horizon, likelihood, magnitude of impact, financial
impact, and key actions to mitigate risk. Financial impact is evaluated according to the financial impact criteria used in our corporate ERM process across four tiers of impact
to our revenue and operating margin. In developing the Climate Risk Report, the Taskforce identified both climate-related physical risks and climate-related transitional
risks. The most critical climate-related physical risk identified by the Taskforce comes from an increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events that could affect
the operations of Ralph Lauren's raw materials and finished goods suppliers and the communities where they operate, including flooding and other weather-related
disruptions at factories. We are responding to this climate-related risk by implementing a sourcing strategy focused on near-shoring, geographic diversification, and the use
of sustainable materials. This strategy will help mitigate potential increases in raw material costs due to extreme weather events in one sourcing country or region by
allowing us to more easily shift our sourcing to other countries or regions. Specifically, we have set a goal to switch to 100 percent sustainable sourced key materials by
2025, including cotton that is either from the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), Fair Trade certified, organic, recycled, transitional, or aligned to the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol.
The Taskforce also identified climate-related transitional risks, including the need to transition to lower emissions technology to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions
impact of our operations and supply chain in line with our goal of reducing our absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 30% by 2030 from our FY20 baseline. To address
the technological challenges of transitioning to a low-carbon business model, we are investing in technologies that have the potential to reduce the emissions of our
products, such as our partnership with Natural Fiber Welding which led to the launch of the RLX CLARUS® Polo Shirt. This product marked the unveiling of a first-to-market
patented platform that transforms virgin and recycled cotton in ways previously not possible. The shirt featured a high-performance cotton that performs similarly to plastic-
based synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon, but without the use of petroleum-based fossil fuels.

Nominating, Governance, Citizenship and Sustainability Committee is responsible for oversight of sustainability and ESG matters, including climate risk. To assess climate
risks, the Taskforce describes risks according to the following categories: where the risk occurs, risk type, risk driver, time horizon, likelihood, magnitude of impact, financial
impact, and key actions to mitigate risk. Financial impact is evaluated according to the financial impact criteria used in our corporate ERM process across four tiers of impact
to our revenue and operating margin. In developing the Climate Risk Report, the Taskforce identified both climate-related physical risks and climate-related transitional
risks. The most critical climate-related physical risk identified by the Taskforce comes from an increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events that could affect
the operations of Ralph Lauren's raw materials and finished goods suppliers and the communities where they operate, including flooding and other weather-related
disruptions at factories. We are responding to this climate-related risk by implementing a sourcing strategy focused on near-shoring, geographic diversification, and the use
of sustainable materials. This strategy will help mitigate potential increases in raw material costs due to extreme weather events in one sourcing country or region by
allowing us to more easily shift our sourcing to other countries or regions. Specifically, we have set a goal to switch to 100 percent sustainable sourced key materials by
2025, including cotton that is either from the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), Fair Trade certified, organic, recycled, transitional, or aligned to the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol.
The Taskforce also identified climate-related transitional risks, including the need to transition to lower emissions technology to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions
impact of our operations and supply chain in line with our goal of reducing our absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 30% by 2030 from our FY20 baseline. To address
the technological challenges of transitioning to a low-carbon business model, we are investing in technologies that have the potential to reduce the emissions of our
products, such as our partnership with Natural Fiber Welding which led to the launch of the RLX CLARUS® Polo Shirt. This product marked the unveiling of a first-to-market
patented platform that transforms virgin and recycled cotton in ways previously not possible. The shirt featured a high-performance cotton that performs similarly to plastic-
based synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon, but without the use of petroleum-based fossil fuels.

Company-specific description
An increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events could affect the operations of Ralph Lauren's raw materials and finished goods suppliers and the
communities where they operate, including flooding and other weather-related disruptions at factories. Weather events that cause manufacturing infrastructure damage and
flooding cause disruptions in timing throughout the supply chain that can affect revenue by decreasing production capacity and reliability and increasing wages and fuel
prices, which could result in higher manufacturing costs. Chronic changes in weather can affect the availability, quality, and price of the raw materials that Ralph Lauren
depends on. One of the major raw materials in Ralph Lauren’s products is cotton, which is a crop that is known to be affected by variation in annual rainfall and extreme
precipitation, such as hail. This may impact the communities and people that grow cotton, leading to a reduction in the supply of cotton and/or shifts in the key cotton-
producing regions, which could affect material prices and quality.

Explanation of financial impact figure
Our Climate Risk Taskforce evaluated the financial impact of this risk according to the financial impact criteria used in our corporate Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
process across four tiers of impact to our revenue and operating margin. This risk has been assigned the lowest financial impact category, with an estimated revenue impact
of less than $70 million. This estimate is based on our assessment of potential financial impacts from fluctuations in the cost of cotton. Recent internal analysis has shown
that we could see a 20-30% increase in the cost of cotton from overall market shifts. However, these market shifts have not translated to increases to our costs of goods
sold due to elements of our sourcing strategy mitigating this variability, including origin country shifts, and consolidation of materials and suppliers.
Cost of response to risk
Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
The financial impact of this risk can be mitigated through our sourcing strategy. This includes strategies to achieve balanced diversified country allocation, near shoring, and
localization of materials. We are working to consolidate our supply chain, with a goal for 80 percent of our business to be with strategic and key suppliers by 2025.

Company-specific description
We have operations, including retail, distribution, and warehousing operations, in locations subject to natural disasters, such as severe weather caused by climate change,
any of which could disrupt our operations. This includes major facilities in the East Coast of the United States, located in states such as New York, New Jersey, and North
Carolina that have been subject to hurricanes, floods, and other extreme weather events in the past ten years. The occurrence of natural disasters or other catastrophic
events may result in sudden disruptions in the business operations of the local economies affected, as well as of the regional and global economies. Any of these events
could result in decreased demand for our products and disruptions in our sales channels and manufacturing and distribution networks, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, as storms become more severe and higher than average rainfall occurs as a result of
climate change, the facilities operated by Ralph Lauren may experience business disruptions, expenses, and other financial impacts, as well as costs to protect and retrofit
existing facilities to be more resilient to extreme weather events. This also includes an increase in philanthropic contributions to relief organizations in response to natural
disasters that occur in countries where we operate.

An increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events could affect Ralph Lauren’s logistics supply chain, including transporting goods from finished goods
suppliers to distribution centers and then to customers. We rely upon third-party transportation providers for virtually all our product shipments, including shipments to and
from our distribution centers, to our stores and shop-within-shops, and to our digital commerce and wholesale customers. Our utilization of these shipping services are
subject to various risks, including severe weather caused by climate change. For example, in recent years several ships carrying our product have experienced extreme
weather during Pacific Ocean crossings leading to delays in the supply chain and delivery of our products. Weather events that lead to transportation infrastructure damage
and flooding cause disruptions that can affect revenue by decreasing transportation availability and increasing wages and fuel prices, which could result in higher

As Ralph Lauren’s suppliers become more innovative and able to drive efficiencies in processes, material usage, water, and energy consumption, there are opportunities to
reduce cost. For example, this year we continued our progress implementing Color on Demand, a multi-phased system with a clear ambition to deliver the world’s first
scalable zero wastewater cotton dyeing system. As part of the first phase of Color on Demand, Ralph Lauren optimized the use of ECOFAST™ Pure Sustainable Textile
Treatment, a pre-treatment solution developed by Dow for cotton textiles. When used with existing dyeing equipment, ECOFAST™ Pure enables the use of up to 40% less
water, 85% fewer chemicals, 90% less energy and a 60% reduction in carbon footprint compared to traditional cotton dyeing processes. In FY22 we launched an open-
source ECOFAST™ manual in collaboration with Dow to support faster adoption of this improved dyeing process. By 2025, we aim to use the Color on Demand platform in
more than 80% of our solid cotton products, leading to cost savings and GHG reductions in upstream production.

Company-specific description
Ralph Lauren’s climate strategy includes development of low emission products and materials. We are currently using and aiming to increase the use of recycled content for
both synthetic and natural fibers, as well as cotton grown with less chemical inputs and irrigation water than conventional cotton. Our strategy also includes the use of
regeneratively grown fibers and materials to support carbon drawdown by healthy soils. In FY22, 76% of our units produced met at least one of our sustainable material
criteria—up from 33% in FY21. Last year we announced a comprehensive circularity strategy to further advance sustainability goals. We’re focused on using the principles
of Cradle to CradleTM (C2C) as foundational inspiration for all aspects of design, development, manufacturing, packaging and the post-sale experience. Ralph Lauren has
been working closely with the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute to support the adoption of the latest version of the C2C standard and to provide apparel brand
perspective on its use. In FY22, we began working on our first C2C-certified product, a luxury cashmere sweater, which will be in-market late 2022. We will also continue to
invest in scalable technologies that will elevate the quality of recycled materials so that they are of the same high quality and feel as virgin material. In 2020, Ralph Lauren
invested in Natural Fiber Welding, a leading sustainable material science startup that is scaling a new industry standard for natural fiber recycling. As part of this
commitment, Ralph Lauren will produce 100% recycled cotton products across our portfolio by 2025. Our partnership with Natural Fiber Welding was on display at the 2022
Australian Open with the launch of the RLX CLARUS® Polo Shirt. It marked the unveiling of a first-to-market patented platform that transforms virgin and recycled cotton in

team and Board of Directors. The Climate Risk Report is reviewed by our Global Citizenship & Sustainability Steering Committee, who is responsible for ensuring climate
risk is built into our operating model and business strategy. The Climate Risk Report is then presented to the Board of Directors, where the Nominating, Governance,
Citizenship and Sustainability Committee is responsible for oversight of sustainability and ESG matters, including climate risk. Results and recommendations from our
use of climate-related scenario analysis will be included in our semiannual Climate Risk Report and, as appropriate, incorporated into our ERM to ensure we understand if
and how our corporate strategy and supporting investments should change in response to potential climate change scenarios.

We take a holistic approach to sourcing preferred fibers and materials for our products, including the consideration of climate-related risks and opportunities. For example, we know that
supporting the increased supply of sustainably-grown, climate-resilient cotton on a global scale is imperative in order to meet our medium-term 2025 goal of using 100% sustainably-
sourced cotton. This year we continued our transition to sustainable cotton for apparel products, including polo shirts, knits, chinos and shirts, Ralph Lauren Home transitioned 95% of
core bedding and bath and new fashion bedding to cotton qualities we recognize as sustainable, such as organic or Better Cotton. Organic cotton fiber currently makes up less than 1%
of cotton grown annually. There are several barriers for farmers who want to switch from conventional to certified organic farming, including financial challenges and a two- to three-year
transitional period before achieving certification. Directly supporting farmers during this transition provides an opportunity for brands like Ralph Lauren to help increase the quantity of
organic cotton available on the market. In Spring 2023, with the help of The Sourcery and our mill and factory partners, we plan to introduce products made with transitional or in-
conversion cotton from farmers in India.
Supply
chain
and/or
value
chain
Yes
Based on our assessment of our GHG emissions and climate risks within our supply chain, we established a roadmap to drive significant GHG reductions and risk mitigation in our
manufacturing. As part of this roadmap, in FY20, we launched our Supplier Engagement Strategy to establish and maintain collaborative partnerships and systems that foster increased
transparency and accountability. Our sustainability expectations are included in the Supplier Engagement Strategy, which include considerations that can be used in the future to
mitigate risks from climate change in our supply base. For example, we strive for geographical diversity in our key and strategic suppliers, which will support our efforts to mitigate the risk
of disruptions in our supply chain from climate change. With over 40% of our total scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions coming from manufacturing, helping our manufacturers achieve significant
emissions reductions will be critical for achieving our science-based GHG emissions target. We continuously engage our suppliers through the Higg Index Facility Environmental Module
(FEM) to monitor their energy use and emissions data and drive improvement. The result of the Higg Index FEM assessment including the energy performance and emissions is
incorporated to the supplier evaluation scorecard (as part of the Supplier Engagement Strategy framework), which informs business decisions and supplier segmentation. In FY22, we
increased our engagement with our manufacturing partners to ensure carbon footprint reduction is fully integrated into their strategic roadmap. We began to invest in technical support for
our partners to develop decarbonization strategy, set targets and implementation plans that aligns with the industry’s timeline and ambition level. We continue to partner with the Apparel
Impact Institute (aii) to roll out the Carbon Leadership Program within our supply chain. We conducted a supply chain carbon emission analysis prior to the roll out to identify priority
facilities to develop a decarbonization pathway. Through the Program, each manufacturing facility is provided with technical support and toolkit to develop their bespoke 2025 and 2030
carbon and water reduction roadmaps and clear action plan with near-, medium- and long-term priorities that align with the broader industry ambitions and best practices.
Investment
in R&D
Yes
Our Product and Business Model Innovation Teams invest and drive adoption of technologies and platforms that reduce the use of virgin raw materials, increase energy and resource
use efficiency, and prolong the life and durability of our products. These investments have the potential to lead to increased revenues resulting from cost savings as well as innovation in
sustainable customer offerings. Through the execution of our strategy of R&D investment, we expect to realize these opportunities in the medium-term (i.e., in the next two to five years).
This includes a minority investment in Natural Fiber Welding, Inc. (NFW), a leading sustainable material science startup that has revolutionized the reuse of natural fibers – such as
cotton waste – into patented, high-performance materials. Through this investment, we are looking to expand our use of recycled post-consumer cotton, helping to advance our progress
toward sustainable sourcing of 100% of our key materials, including cotton, by 2025 and integrating zero-waste principles across our business. The partnership has enabled us to begin
replacing and reducing our reliance on non-biodegradable synthetics, such as polyester and nylon, while scaling the use of more sustainable and upcycled materials. Our partnership
with Natural Fiber Welding was on display at the 2022 Australian Open with the launch of the RLX CLARUS® Polo Shirt. It marked the unveiling of a first-to-market patented platform
that transforms virgin and recycled cotton in ways previously not possible. The shirt featured a high-performance cotton that performs similarly to plastic-based synthetic fabrics like
polyester and nylon, but without the use of petroleum-based fossil fuels. The shirt will be available to consumers worldwide in summer 2022.
Operations Yes
Ralph Lauren may become affected by carbon taxes and other pricing schemes that affect the cost of purchased electricity consumed at our offices, stores, and distribution centers. At
the same time, Ralph Lauren will need to deploy lower emissions technologies in order to achieve our greenhouse gas reduction commitments and to meet our commitment to source
100% renewable electricity in our direct operations by 2025 (i.e., in the next three years). This includes overcoming constraints in our facilities and lease arrangements to deploy energy
efficiency technologies and source renewable power. To mitigate potential increases in the costs non-renewable electricity and potential future carbon taxes applied to non-renewable
electricity consumption, we have developed a global strategy for sourcing renewable electricity across our owned and operated facilities and have begun engaging various teams
throughout our business to execute this strategy. A key aspect of our strategy will be signing one or more virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) in North America and Europe.
When fully implemented, these long-term agreements will provide us with renewable energy attribute certificates equivalent to the majority of our annual global electricity consumption in
those regions, mitigating the risk of carbon taxes from non-renewable electricity consumption. In evaluating VPPAs throughout FY22, we convened our cross-functional working group
that draws on the perspective and expertise of members of our sustainability, procurement, legal, tax, accounting, and finance business functions. In 2021 and 2022, the contributions of
the members of the working groups informed the definition of key commercial terms and go-to-market strategy for sourcing a VPPA in North America, evaluation and selection of specific
projects and developers, and negotiation of contract terms.

Target ambition
1.5°C aligned
Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
In FY20, we established a science-based target to reduce our absolute GHG emissions by 30 percent by 2030, compared to 2020 levels. This target includes reducing
emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity and reducing emissions from our supply chain (scope 3). In June 2020, SBTi
verified that this target is aligned with GHG reductions required to keep global temperature rise to 1.5°C for Scope 1 and 2 and well below 2°C for Scope 3. We plan to
increase the ambition of this 2030 target alongside our industry to align with a 1.5°C scenario across Scope 1, 2, and 3. Beyond 2030, we intend to achieve net zero GHG
emissions by 2040. We plan to seek SBTi approval for our new 2030 target and our net zero target in calendar year 2022. To accompany these commitments, we published
a Net Zero Commitment Statement that details how we will achieve these targets. Ralph Lauren’s annual carbon footprints are aligned with our fiscal years. The baseline
year of our science-based target is aligned with FY20, which ran from April 2019 to March 2020. However, the target language of the SBTi specifies 2030 as the target year.
Due to our reporting cycle being misaligned with the reporting year, we’re aiming to achieve our 2030 goal in our FY31 reporting, which will cover April 2030 to March 2031.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Achieving and sustaining our 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target will require adoption of low- and zero-carbon practices throughout our supply chain. As we develop and
refine our roadmap to achieving this goal, we have identified the strategies that will be most important to reach this target. These strategies include the electricity used in
our operations, energy used by our suppliers, how we transport our goods, the raw materials in our products and the circular products and experiences we offer to
customers. Continuing trends from last year, the lingering business disruptions from COVID-19 are reflected in our overall carbon footprint, as our absolute emissions
decreased by 32% in FY22 from our FY20 baseline. These changes are driven by production volumes decreasing by over 25.6% compared to FY20, which contributes
significantly to our Scope 3 emissions from manufacturing and raw materials. These changes in emissions are also driven by regular improvements to our carbon footprint
methodology consistent with carbon accounting best practices, including collecting more complete data from our suppliers and updates to our underlying emission factors.
We remain committed to implementing our GHG action plan for achieving our carbon reduction targets.

Science Based Targets initiative
Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
In FY20, we joined RE100 and committed to the goal of powering our owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100 percent renewable electricity by
2025. As of FY22, 6% percent of electricity used in our operations was from renewable sources. We expect this number to significantly increase as we put our renewable
energy strategy into action.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
In FY22, 6% of electricity used in our operations was from renewable sources, such as wind power. This is consistent with the share of renewable electricity used in FY21
and represents renewable energy attribute certificate purchases in Europe. We continued to implement our renewables strategy in FY22 focused on virtual power purchase
agreements (VPPAs) in North America and Europe. We expect to sign our first VPPA in FY23. For any remaining renewable electricity needs, we will source renewable
energy credits (RECs) and equivalent certificates.

We have set a target to achieve net zero emissions across our value chain by 2040. In setting this target in 2021, we aligned our target with the 10 initial recommendations
defined in the Science Based Targets Initiative’s Foundations for Science-Based Net-Zero Target Setting In The Corporate Sector. We acknowledge this is an emerging
and changing space. We expect that we may have to adjust our strategy in response to new guidance and scientific findings. As part of the Race to Zero Campaign, we
have answered the call of Science Based Targets Initiative’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign by pledging to set and achieve a net-zero target in line with a 1.5°C
future. We plan to seek SBTI approval for our net zero target in calendar year 2022.
Do you intend to neutralize any unabated emissions with permanent carbon removals at the target year?
Yes
Planned milestones and/or near-term investments for neutralization at target year
We believe nature-based climate solutions are a key part of a holistic net zero strategy. While we ramp up our use of regenerative and recycled materials, taking action now
to build capacity and supply of these fibers—through investment in our value chain and purchasing carbon removals—will be key to ensuring that fiber from regenerative
systems is available in the future. With over 80 percent of our products made of cotton, protecting and regenerating ecosystems will be core to our carbon removals
strategy. In selecting carbon removals projects, we will prioritize land-based interventions that help preserve and enhance carbon stocks both within and beyond our own
value chain. As we evaluate these projects, we will be looking at more than just the amount of carbon removed to ensure these interventions lead to: robust social and
environmental co-benefits, including preserving the biodiversity of local ecosystems and cultures as well as ensuring equitable access to natural resources; additional
removals that would otherwise not have occurred; permanent carbon storage with mitigation plans for leakage; quantifiable and unique removals that can be verified by an
accredited third-party. In 2021 we began committing to nature-based carbon removal projects. These projects provide incentives for newly adopted regenerative farming
practices, allowing farmers to earn income from verified carbon credits. By supporting financial incentives for U.S. growers to prioritize soil health and regenerative
practices, we believe we can accelerate progress toward our net zero commitments.

 We continued to implement our renewables strategy in FY22 focused on virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) in North America and Europe. We expect to sign our
first VPPA in FY23. In identifying and sourcing new-build solar and wind projects and signing long-term power purchase agreements, we are directly contributing to bringing
new capacity into the grid in the regions where we operate. For any remaining renewable electricity needs, we will source renewable energy credits (RECs) and equivalent
certificates. We believe these purchases will indirectly contribute to bringing new capacity into the grid in the regions where we operate by sending a market signal about the
growing demand for renewable electricity.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) aims to achieve mutual, long-term, positive impacts across our supply chain. This requires enduring partnerships based on
transparency and trust. The SES provides a framework for us in building and maintaining these partnerships. It enables us to develop performance-based supply chain
segmentation, as well as drive continuous improvement and positive impact that are based on shared transparency, accountability and value creation. In FY22, we
expanded our SES and supplier performance evaluation to all suppliers, including suppliers in the North America, Latin America, EMEA, and APAC regions. We
communicate our expectations of responsible practices with all suppliers and seek feedback from our strategic and key partners on their expectations on us as a
responsible purchasing practice. Currently, 53% of our business is with the strategic and key suppliers (21 % of suppliers by number), and we are aiming to grow to 80% by
2025. We integrated sustainability into our supplier performance evaluation scorecard where climate, water, and chemical management performance sit alongside other
business-critical issues such as quality. Sustainability performance is a substantial contributor to the supplier’s overall performance evaluation scorecard, which is used to
inform business decisions and segmentation.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) provides a framework for us to build and maintain mutual, long-term partnerships with our suppliers. The performance-based
supply chain segmentation takes into account the supplier’s performance in sustainability metrics, including climate, water stewardship, and sustainable chemicals
management. Our strategic and key supplier segments are held to a higher degree of expectations and are incentivized through growing business and transparency. We
rely on our partnership with the suppliers to drive reductions in our Scope 3 – manufacturing footprint to achieve our Science Based Target. We continue to invest in

programs and initiatives that support our supply partners in setting up and implementing sustainability and climate roadmap that aligns with or exceed our goals. We are
committed through the UNFCCC Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action to continuously pursue energy efficiency measures, coal phase-out, and renewable energy
adoption in our value chain. In FY22, we continued our partnership with the Apparel Impact Institute (aii) to roll out the Carbon Leadership Program within our supply chain.
We conducted a supply chain carbon emission analysis prior to the roll out to identify priority facilities to develop a decarbonization pathway. Through the Program, we
invested in technical support for each manufacturing facility to develop their bespoke 2025 and 2030 carbon and water reduction roadmaps and clear action plan with near-,
medium- and long-term priorities that align with the broader industry ambitions and best practices. Our Product and Business Model Innovation Teams invest and drive
adoption of technologies and platforms that increase energy and resource use efficiency and prolong the life and durability of our products.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
The success of our climate strategy requires engagement with our suppliers to reduce emissions throughout our supply chain. The first step to integrating our suppliers into
our strategy is to ensure they are complying with our code of conduct. Each supplier is required to sign our Vendor Compliance Packet (VCP) which details our code of
conduct. This legal document also features our sustainability policy. We incorporated our climate commitment into our supply chain and materials sustainability policy which
covers all suppliers and licensees.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
We are committed to a 30% reduction in absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by 2030 compared to a FY20 baseline. Through our Vendor Compliance Packet (VCP),
our suppliers are made aware of our sustainability policy, and are expected to comply with the requirements set therein as they sign the agreement. Since FY21, we
integrated citizenship and sustainability into our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES), and launched our Vendor Management System (VMS), a database that enables us to
share information and opportunities with all tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers. As part of our Supplier Engagement Strategy, we integrated citizenship and sustainability into our
supplier evaluation scorecard, where sustainable materials, chemical management, water stewardship, and climate performance now sit alongside other business-critical
issues such as quality.

Through our Vendor Compliance Packet, we set a clear expectation that all facilities manufacturing Ralph Lauren products and materials track and report their
environmental and climate impact data via the Higg Index Facilities Environment Module (FEM) on an annual basis. We continued to engage closely with our Tier 1 and
Tier 2 suppliers through the Higg Index FEM. We also rolled out third-party verification of the FEM data in accordance with protocols set by the Sustainable Apparel
Coalition (SAC). While we require all suppliers to share Higg FEM verified data with us, in FY22, 59 % of the active factories representing 92% of total business spend had
shared their data with us, including our strategic and key suppliers. We continue to invest in efforts to increase visibility to our supply chain climate and environmental data
through expanding the adoption of Higg FEM and third party verification in partnership with the SAC and Higg Co.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
We are committed to the industry’s collective effort to increase visibility of environmental and climate data monitoring and drive the adoption of manufacturing best practices.
Through the Higg Index Facility Environmental Module (FEM), we gain visibility to our supplier’s environmental data on an annual basis. The data is used to monitor our
footprint and progress made over time. In FY22, we collected data from 273 Tier 1 facilities, representing 92% of our supply chain spend—an increase from 77% last year.
Within the reporting facilities, 229 (87% of our business spend) have completed data verification by an SAC-approved third party. Facilities scored an average of 46 points
across all sections, with an average of 59 points in the water section and 71 in the energy section. The expanded FEM rollout also covered 50 Tier 2 facilities (up from 31
facilities last year), representing approximately 54% of our woven and knit fabric, as well as sweater yarn production. A total of 48 facilities (25 facilities in FY21) have
completed third-party verification with an average score of 58 points (49 last year) across all sections. The mills scored an average of 87 points in the energy section, 70
points in the water section, and 39 points in the chemical section.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) aims to achieve mutual, long-term, positive impacts across our supply chain. This requires enduring partnerships based on
transparency and trust. The SES provides a framework for us in building and maintaining these partnerships. It enables us to develop performance-based supply chain
segmentation, as well as drive continuous improvement and positive impact that are based on shared transparency, accountability and value creation. In FY22, we
expanded our SES and supplier performance evaluation to all suppliers. We communicate our expectations of responsible practices with all suppliers, and seek feedback
from our strategic and key partners on their expectations of us as a responsible purchasing practice. Currently, 53% of our business is with the strategic and key suppliers
(21 % of suppliers by number), and we are aiming to grow to 80% by 2025. We integrated sustainability into our supplier performance evaluation scorecard where climate,
water, and chemical management performance sit alongside other business-critical issues such as quality. The sustainability performance is a substantial contributor to the
supplier’s overall performance evaluation scorecard, which is used to inform business decisions and segmentation.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) provides a framework for us to build and maintain mutual, long-term partnerships with our suppliers. The performance-based
supply chain segmentation takes into account the supplier’s performance in sustainability metrics, including climate, water stewardship, and sustainable chemicals
management. Our strategic and key supplier segments are held to a higher degree of expectations and are incentivized through growing business and transparency. We
rely on our partnership with the suppliers to drive reductions in our Scope 3 – manufacturing footprint to achieve our Science Based Target. We continue to invest in
programs and initiatives that support our supply partners in setting up and implementing sustainability and climate roadmap that aligns with or exceed our goals. We are
committed through the UNFCCC Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action to continuously pursue energy efficiency measures, coal phase-out, and renewable energy
adoption in our value chain. In FY22, we continued our partnership with the Apparel Impact Institute (aii) to roll out the Carbon Leadership Program within our supply chain.
We conducted a supply chain carbon emission analysis prior to the roll out to identify priority facilities to develop a decarbonization pathway. Through the Program, we
invested in technical support for each manufacturing facility to develop their bespoke 2025 and 2030 carbon and water reduction roadmaps and clear action plan with near-,
medium- and long-term priorities that align with the broader industry ambitions and best practices. Our Product and Business Model Innovation Teams invest and drive
adoption of technologies and platforms that increase energy and resource use efficiency and prolong the life and durability of our products.

Ralph Lauren understands that our actions alone are not enough to address climate-related strategies throughout our value chain. We partner with industry coalitions
including the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, Apparel Impact Institute, UNFCCC Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, and the Zero Discharge of Hazardous
Chemicals (ZDHC) to further our efforts in collaboration with our suppliers to reduce climate and environmental impact from manufacturing practices. While we require all
suppliers to share climate and environmental impact data with us, in FY22, 59% of the active factories representing 92% of total business spend had shared their data with
us, including our strategic and key suppliers. We continue to invest in efforts to increase visibility to our supply chain climate and environmental data through expanding the
adoption of Higg FEM and third party verification in partnership with the SAC and Higg Co. The collaborative programs support our suppliers in climate and environmental
data tracking and monitoring, and in establishing energy and carbon reduction roadmap
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
We have committed to 30% reduction in absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by 2030 compared to a FY20 baseline. We work closely with our suppliers to increase
visibility into climate and environmental data tracking and monitoring through the Higg Index FEM and ZDHC tools, and in establishing an energy and carbon reduction
roadmap through the collaborative programs with our industry partners. Our Product and Business Model Innovation Teams invest and drive adoption of technologies and
platforms that increase energy and resource use efficiency and prolong the life and durability of our products. In FY22 we announced the debut of the RLX CLARUS® Polo
Shirt exclusively at the 2022 Australian Open Tennis Tournament, showcasing our latest work in groundbreaking product innovation and sustainability. Made with the
world’s first high-performance cotton fabric, the RLX CLARUS® Polo Shirt utilizes a first-to-market patented platform to transform virgin and recycled cotton in ways that
were never before possible. The technology creates enhanced cotton fibers with high-performance attributes, like quick-drying and moisture management, while still
retaining the comfort and breathability of cotton. The resulting material performs similarly to plastic-based synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon, that use petroleum-
based fossil fuels to achieve performance benefits. The textile innovation was developed by Natural Fiber Welding, Inc. (NFW), a leading sustainable material science
startup.

Please explain the rationale for selecting this group of customers and scope of engagement
The use and end-of-life treatment of our sold products contribute approximately 19% of our overall Scope 3 carbon footprint. Our circularity strategy aims to reduce those
emissions by offering our customers innovative products and experiences. In June 2022 we announced our new Live On promise to enable our past and future products to
live on responsibly by 2030. The Ralph Lauren Live On promise builds on the Company’s existing circularity strategy and is supported by three foundational pillars that
guide initial goals: (1) Design for Circularity: Ralph Lauren has committed to designing our products according to circular principles by 2025, including a goal to make five
iconic products C2C Certified®. In addition, we will offer high quality products made with 100% recycled cotton. (2) Enable Circular Consumer Experiences: We have
committed to extend the life of our products by piloting ways for its consumers to rent, repair, and recirculate Ralph Lauren products by 2025, in select top cities. (3)
Advance the Circular Economy: By 2025, we will also invest in scaling regenerative practices – such as the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund – and innovative technologies
like Natural Fiber Welding, a leading sustainable material science startup that is scaling a new industry standard for natural fiber recycling.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
The impact of this engagement will be measured based on our progress towards achieving the initial goals of our Live On promise. For example, we have committed to
designing our products according to circular principles by 2025, including a goal to make five iconic products C2C Certified®. We recently announced that our iconic
cashmere sweater will be the first-of-its-kind luxury Cradle to Cradle (C2C) Certified® product. Cradle to Cradle certification is the global standard for products that are safe,
circular, and responsibly made. Every component of the sweater will be certified, from the cashmere fiber to its rich dyes, and iconic label made with organic cotton.
Consumers will have the option of recirculating their sweater for its next use through a cashmere recycling program. Ralph Lauren’s C2C Certified® Cashmere sweater will
be available later in 2022.
C12.1d
(C12.1d) Give details of your climate-related engagement strategy with other partners in the value chain.
 We regularly engage with our peers and other organizations through collaborative projects and programs to leverage collective action to address climate change impacts in
our value chain. In particular, we have focused on collaborative initiatives to reduce emissions from our raw materials sourcing, manufacturing, and processing, and
transportation and distribution, as these comprise the largest sources of emissions in our value chain. This year, we were actively involved in a number of initiatives driving
collective action to address climate change impacts in our value chain, including the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, Apparel Impact Institute, UN Fashion Industry Charter for
Climate Action, and the G7 Fashion Pact. Through engagement with these initiatives, we have come to better understand that our actions alone are not enough to address
climate-related strategies throughout our value chain. For example, as signatories to the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, we have committed to establishing a
decarbonization pathway and continuously pursue coal phase-out, energy efficiency measures and renewable energy in our value chain, including suppliers in the North
America, Latin America, EMEA, and APAC regions. The challenge we face, along with our fellow Fashion Charter signatories, is finding efficient and effective methods for
decarbonization in our supply chain, including with suppliers where we are one of several customers. Building off the Fashion Charter’s guidance for supply chain
decarbonization, we analyzed our GHG emissions and climate risks within our supply chain and established a roadmap to drive significant GHG reductions in our
manufacturing. It has become clear that in order to deliver on our ambitious roadmap, we need to work closely with our suppliers to align their climate agenda, focus, and
priorities with ours. As a result of this analysis and engagement with the Fashion Charter and the Apparel Impact Institute, we are drawing on guidance and programs from
these partners to support our suppliers in establishing an energy and carbon reduction strategy and roadmap. We expect that these suppliers’ strategies will be crucial in
ensuring we achieve our target of a 30% reduction in absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by 2030 compared to a FY20 baseline. We are therefore expanding our
collaboration with suppliers through collective action programs that accelerate the standardized approach to setting carbon targets and low-carbon action plans at the factory
level and help them build capability to implement them. We believe this will further empower our supply partners to establish and implement climate strategies aligned with
our climate objectives.

Climate-related requirement
Complying with regulatory requirements
Description of this climate related requirement
We explicitly state in our Vendor Compliance and Operating Standards that all suppliers are required to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations of the regions where
they operate, including, but not limited to, the local environmental standards. We have the right to terminate our business relationship should the supplier fail to comply with
the applicable laws and regulations. In addition to that, we are screening our supply base for any potential significant environmental impacts through the Higg Index Facility
Environmental Module and the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) Supervision platform (the latter is specific to China-based facilities). If an issue is found,
we require the supplier to take corrective action and put in place preventive measures to avoid recurrence. Specifically, on any violation record found on the IPE platform,
we also require the facilities—at a minimum—to publish enterprise feedback onto the platform, which details the corrective and preventive measures taken. In FY22, we
screened all our Tier 1 facilities and our top mills through these platforms. We identified 13 facilities with potential significant environmental impacts related to industrial
wastewater, permits and air emissions. We do not use Higg FEM assessment results or IPE records to terminate business relationships with suppliers. We addressed all
the identified facilities to ensure corrective action and preventive measures are in place.

Ralph Lauren believes that the United States must play a leading role in the transition to a low-carbon world. The United States’ recent commitment to reduce emissions by
50-52% by 2030 is an important step on the pathway to achieving net-zero GHG emissions by no later than 2050 and of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. However, to
achieve this commitment and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, there is a need for strong federal climate policies. Our stance on US climate policy action can be found
attached to this question. We also recently joined a series of commitments urging global leaders to prioritize climate legislation that supports our Net Zero goals. These
include: We Mean Business Coalition – G-20 Climate Statement: Aligned with the Company’s recent announcement to achieve net zero global greenhouse gas emissions
from its operations and value chain by 2040, the Ralph Lauren Corporation signed a statement in support of urging G-20 nations to strengthen their Nationally Determined
Contributions by at least halving global emissions by 2030 and committing to achieve net zero emissions by no later than 2050. Clean Energy Demand Initiative: To utilize
the Company’s scale to create impact, the Ralph Lauren Corporation is actively advocating for cost-effective and robust clean energy procurement options in several key
global markets where the Company operates or sources its products. Textile Exchange – Preferential Tariff Project: As a member of the U.N. Fashion Industry Charter for
Climate Action and the Textile Exchange, the Ralph Lauren Corporation signed a policy statement issued to all COP26 participating nations requesting that policymakers
work closely with the apparel, textile and footwear industry to develop thoughtful trade policy mechanisms, specifically those that would drive the adoption of
environmentally preferred materials and enable achievement of the Textile Exchange’s industry goal of a 45% greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030 in the pre-
spinning phase of textile fiber and materials production, in line with the Paris Agreement. Additional details can be found attached to C12.3.

In 2021, the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation made a founding grant to launch the Soil Health Institute’s U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund (USRCF), a unique, farmer-
facing, science-based initiative that will support long-term, sustainable cotton production in the United States, with the goal of eliminating one million metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent (CO2e) from the atmosphere by 2026. The USRCF brings together a diverse group of farmers, advisors, landowners, conservationists, soil scientists,
educators, business leaders, philanthropies and others who share a common belief that together we can create a long-term sustainable cotton industry in the U.S. by
implementing climate-friendly, regenerative practices. In addition to supporting US farmers’ transition to adopting regenerative agriculture practices, Ralph Lauren is
committed to engaging US policymakers to promote the benefits and the fashion industry demand for climate-smart agriculture. This past year, RL has been engaging with
members of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, USDA and the White House to promote the work of the USRCF and the market demand for regen
materials. The USRCF was also recognized as an AIM for Climate Innovation Sprint Partner at COP26 for its investment in US regenerative cotton production over the next

Business Roundtable has supported, and continues to support, more transparent and comparable climate-related disclosures with regard to the material risks and business
opportunities associated with climate change. In 2020, Business Roundtable announced support for the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and a suite of policies to help
achieve those goals. As part of that statement, Business Roundtable noted the following about the role of disclosure: “American corporations must continue to lead the way
in driving efficiency, advancing a spectrum of low to negative emissions technologies and reducing GHG emissions. Many companies seek to be transparent around their
approaches and progress toward those goals. It is important for companies to continue to engage on, and disclose when appropriate, material risks that may be driven by
climate change as well as the business opportunities associated with advancing low-carbon solutions. Effective disclosures should focus on the company’s approach to risk
management and its connection to the company’s strategy and governance. These disclosures should be voluntary and industry supported and should consider leading
disclosure frameworks.” In response to the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s proposed rule “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related
Disclosures for Investors”, we have engaged directly with Business Roundtable to provide feedback on the organization’s comments on the proposed rule. Our perspective
differs from Business Roundtable on certain aspects of the proposed rule, including the importance of quantifying and disclosing corporate scope 3 greenhouse gas
emissions. We have encouraged Business Roundtable to support the inclusion of scope 3 greenhouse gas reporting requirements in the final rule.

principles of the circular economy. The circular economy envisioned by the initiative tackles the root causes of global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss,
and pollution, while creating opportunities for better growth. It is underpinned by three principles, all led by design: eliminate waste and pollution, keep products and
materials in use, and regenerate natural systems.
