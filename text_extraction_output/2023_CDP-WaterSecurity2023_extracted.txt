Ralph Lauren Corporation - Water Security 2023
W0. Introduction
W0.1
(W0.1) Give a general description of and introduction to your organization.
For more than 50 years, we have sought to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. At Ralph Lauren, we believe in creating things that are
timeless — that last and that never go out of style. Our iconic products are created to be worn, loved and passed on through generations. This ethos of timelessness extends
beyond our products to the lives, communities and natural resources our business intersects. We call this framework Timeless by Design, our global approach to citizenship
and sustainability. 
Through Timeless by Design, we are ensuring our philosophy of timelessness is embedded from inspiration through to our products’ every use and reuse. With this as our
North Star, we aim to reduce our overall environmental impact, advance a circular economy and uplift and empower our communities. Our Timeless by Design approach is
supported by three pillars: Create with Intent, Protect the Environment and Champion Better Lives: 
Create With Intent – We are working to implement circular principles and instill cultural awareness practices into our design and development process. By designing with
timelessness in mind from the start, we are enabling our products to live on responsibly and helping our consumers to love their items longer.
Protect The Environment –Beyond creating products more responsibly, we are working to operate in ways that respect our planet, such as transitioning to renewable
energy, diverting waste from landfill and incineration, and efficiently managing water for our business and the communities where we operate.
Champion Better Lives – Shaping a business that is timeless and has a positive impact on tomorrow means building relationships that stand the test of time and ensuring
that everyone is included, respected and empowered. That’s why we’re committed to supporting our employees, our partners and those within our communities — working to
build a brighter future. 
Our Company’s reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products, brands, distribution channels, and international markets. We believe
that our global reach, breadth of lifestyle product offerings, and multi-channel distribution are unique among luxury and apparel companies. Our global reach is extensive, as
we sell directly to customers throughout the world via our 553 retail stores and 722 concession-based shop-within-shops, as well as through our own digital commerce sites
and those of various third-party digital partners. Merchandise is also available through our wholesale distribution channels at over 9,000 doors worldwide, the majority in
specialty stores, as well as through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers. In addition to our directly operated stores and shops, our international
licensing partners operate 182 Ralph Lauren stores and shops.

Direct use: We identified water availability in our direct operations as ‘not very important’ given that the use of freshwater in our owned and operated facilities is currently only
related to domestic purposes that do not represent high-water intensity. We expect this to continue to be the case in the future. 
Indirect use: Currently, the use of freshwater in our indirect operations is vital for raw materials input as well as manufacturing processes. We expect this to continue in the
future. Our water stewardship approach seeks to address use and quality, protect watersheds and ensure access. We partner with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to advance
our work in this area and set a comprehensive strategy for water stewardship. We analyzed our value chain through the WWF Water Risk Filter to map key areas of water risk.
We collect data from the Higg Facility Environment Module (FEM) to track the environmental performance of our suppliers, including on water. This data, combined with water
use data from our owned and operated facilities, enables us to understand our water footprint. Our goal to reduce water use by at least 20 percent by 2025 relates to
manufacturing and processing in our supply chain and water use in our owned and operated facilities, compared to a FY20 baseline. In our direct operations, we seek
opportunities to decrease water use intensity in landscaping at our distribution centers (DCs) and through application of low-flow fixtures in our DCs, offices and stores. In our
manufacturing supply chain, we focus on improving water use efficiency while also considering shared basin-level water needs where our suppliers’ fabric mills, factories, and
laundries are located. In priority water-stressed locations, we are contributing to collective action projects with WWF, local partners and experts to scale water use
assessments and reduction strategies.

Important
Direct use (current): We identified recycled/brackish/produced water availability in our direct operations as ‘not very important’ given the use of water in Ralph Lauren’s owned
and operated facilities is only related to domestic purposes that do not represent high water intensity. The use of recycled water in our business operations is largely
dependent upon the availability and adoption of water recycling technology in the leased, multi-tenant buildings that we largely occupy. 
Indirect use (current): Our manufacturing supply chain uses recycled and process water in the production processes (e.g., dyeing and washing to decrease dependency on
freshwater resources and costs). Due to the limited scale and application, the usage of recycled and process water is currently not as high as compared to freshwater. There
are geographies where our products and materials are manufactured that have regulations related to Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) or the use of recycled water. As such, the
availability of water resources and our manufacturers’ ability to recycle and reuse process water is therefore identified as an important factor in our indirect use. 
Direct use (future): The use of recycled and process water in our owned and operated facilities is likely to remain constant. However, our use of recycled and process water
could increase if there are improvements in the availability and adoption of water recycling technology in the leased, multi-tenant buildings that we largely occupy. 
Indirect use (future): We also foresee the more urgent need to promote water recycling in our manufacturing supply chain. As water recycling technologies mature in our
sourcing regions, it has the potential to become a common practice in the manufacturing facilities globally, and thus help reduce our manufacturing dependency on freshwater
resources.

The facility water consumption was totaled for facilities
with reported water consumption data collected from
utility bills. For facilities without water consumption data,
water intensity values (m3/sqft) were matched with the
facility type (e.g., office, retail, etc.) using an EPA source
and multiplied by the total square footage to estimate the
water consumption at those sites.
Use of freshwater in our owned and operated facilities is only related to domestic
purposes that do not represent high water intensity, and that takes place in the
leased multi-tenant buildings that our facilities largely occupy. As a result, yearly
monitoring of water withdrawals by total volumes is considered sufficient.

We leverage the WWF Water Risk filter to assess basin and operational risk in our manufacturing supply chain across 3 dimensions: physical, regulatory and reputational
risk. This helps us understand physical risk types e.g. scarcity, flooding and quality, as well as regulatory and reputational risks facing manufacturing sites, and the scale of
these risks. In our most recent assessment, 10% of suppliers assessed were identified as facing high or very high overall basin risk, and thus considered to have a potential
substantive impact on water security based on manufacturing and processing activities. Through our water footprint analysis, supplier scorecard, and the Higg FEM, we
also assess supplier dependence and impacts on water and include the dimension of procurement spend. We also adopt the ZDHC MRSL and ZDHC-approved Chemical
Inventory List Management Tools for our suppliers report on chemical use in creating our products, enabling us to assess supplier impacts on water quality.

Our Supply Chain and Product Sustainability Policy outlines our water use reduction goal and states that each production facility utilized or engaged in the manufacture of
Ralph Lauren product is expected to operate in high resource use efficiency to minimize its energy and water consumption. In FY23, we continued to expand our support to
help our partners set facility-level water reduction targets through Aii’s Carbon Leadership Program. We sponsored 48 facilities, representing about 47% of our raw material
business spend, and 19 strategic finished goods facilities. Through the program, sponsored facilities set 2025 and 2030 water reduction targets ranging up to 100%. Based
on the roadmaps developed by the nominated facilities, an aggregated saving estimation of 17 million m3 of water annually has been identified. 10 out of 78 suppliers with

Rationale for your engagement
Freshwater is an essential resource that the apparel industry is heavily reliant on — from growing cotton to dyeing and washing fabric. We commit to reducing water
consumption across our value chain to achieve at least 20% reduction in total water use across our operations and value chain by 2025, compared to FY20 baseline.
Impact of the engagement and measures of success
We continued our partnership with the Apparel Impact Institute (Aii) to roll out the Carbon Leadership Program. Through the Carbon Leadership Program, we invested in
technical support for each participating manufacturing facility to develop their bespoke 2025 and 2030 carbon and water reduction roadmaps and clear action plans with
near-, medium-, and long-term priorities that align with broader industry ambitions and best practices. Success is measured by the number of suppliers enrolled in the
program. In FY23, we expanded our roll out of the Carbon Leadership Program to cover 48 facilities, representing approximately 47% of our raw material business spend,
and 19 strategic finished goods facilities. 10 out of 78 suppliers with potential substantive impact have set a target and action plan to reduce total water withdrawal volumes.
In addition, since FY20, we have been working closely with our suppliers to adopt more water-efficient processing for our materials and product manufacturing. In FY23,
these transitions helped our suppliers avoid an estimated more than 240,000 cubic meters of water use.
Success is measured by the volume of avoided water use.

Rationale for your engagement
Each of our suppliers is required to sign our Vendor Compliance Packet (VCP) which details our code of conduct. This legal document also features our sustainability
policy. We incorporated our water stewardship commitment into our supply chain and materials sustainability policy which covers all suppliers and licensees.
Impact of the engagement and measures of success
The success of our water stewardship strategy requires engagement with our suppliers to manage and reduce water use in our supply chain. Through our Vendor
Compliance Packet (VCP), our suppliers are made aware of our sustainability policy, and are expected to comply with the requirements set therein as they sign the
agreement. We explicitly state in our Vendor Compliance and Operating Standards that all suppliers are required to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations of the
regions where they operate, including, but not limited to, the local environmental standards. We have the right to terminate our business relationship should the supplier fail
to comply with the applicable laws and regulations.
In addition to that, we are screening our supply base for any potential significant environmental impacts through the Higg Facility Environmental Module and the Institute of
Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) Supervision platform (the latter is specific to China-based facilities). If an issue is found, we require the supplier to take corrective
action and put in place preventive measures to avoid recurrence. Specifically, on any violation record found on the IPE platform, we also require the facilities—at a minimum
—to publish enterprise feedback onto the platform, which details the corrective and preventive measures taken.

Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) aims to achieve mutual, long-term, positive impacts across our supply chain. This requires enduring partnerships based on
transparency and trust. The SES provides a framework for us in building and maintaining these partnerships. It enables us to develop performance-based supply chain
segmentation, as well as drive continuous improvement and positive impact that are based on shared transparency, accountability and value creation. In FY23, we
increased the use of industry tools for our supplier scorecard, including Higg Facility Environment Module (FEM) as well as the tracking of resource-efficient production
practices. We communicate our expectations of responsible practices with all suppliers, and seek feedback from our strategic and key partners on their expectations of
responsible purchasing practices. The sustainability performance is a contributor to the supplier’s overall performance evaluation scorecard, which is used to inform
business decisions and segmentation.
Impact of the engagement and measures of success
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) provides a framework for us to build and maintain mutual, long-term partnerships with our suppliers. The performance-based
supply chain segmentation takes into account the supplier’s performance in sustainability metrics, including climate, water stewardship, and sustainable chemicals
management alongside other business-critical issues such as quality. Our strategic and key supplier segments are held to a higher degree of expectations and are
incentivized through growing business and transparency. Currently, 50% of our business is with strategic and key suppliers that meet business, social, and environmental
performance, and we are aiming to grow to 80% by 2025.
Comment
We rely on our partnership with the suppliers to drive reductions in our manufacturing water use. We also continue to invest in programs and initiatives that support our
supply partners in setting up and implementing a sustainability and water stewardship roadmap that aligns with or exceeds our goals.

Innovation & collaboration
Details of engagement
Encourage stakeholders to work collaboratively with other users in their river basins toward sustainable water management
Rationale for your engagement
Our rationale for prioritizing engagements with value chain partners is to understand our water footprint and water risk assessment. Our strategy includes engagements with
manufacturing partners and local communities and entities where we operate. An example of this is our participation in WWF’s Noyyal-Bhavani Collective Action Program to
help address industry impacts on freshwater in the region. The goal of the program is that by 2030, the Noyyal and Bhavani sub-basins are healthy river ecosystems that
ensure water security for people and nature. In 2022, 13 textile wet processing facilities joined the program and were evaluated for potential water management
improvement opportunities and provided with recommendation plans. Through the implementation of these improvement opportunities, the 13 sites saved a total of more
than 114,330 cubic meters of water in 2022.
Impact of the engagement and measures of success
Success in this program is measured based on achievement of WWF’s three objectives for the collective action program: to assess the interactions and trade-offs between
users and sectors in representative zones of the Bhavani and Noyyal river basin; to demonstrate pilots in key sites to strengthen the positive interactions leading to healthy
river ecosystems and water security; and to influence sectoral, local, regional and national policies that deliver on a shared vision and outcomes for sustainable river basin
management.

We are investing in engagement with U.S. cotton farmers through the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund (USRCF) led by the Soil Health Institute (SHI), who works with
growers to support adoption of soil health management systems, including practices such as cover crops and reduced tillage, across more than 1 million acres of U.S.
cotton cropland. The founding investment in USRCF from The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation enables SHI to accelerate and scale these efforts to reach farmers in a
way they haven’t before.

Rationale for your engagement
Safe drinking water is the most primary of human needs, yet worldwide, one in three people do not have access to this vital resource. To help end this disparity, we support
organizations providing clean water for those in need. Since 2018, the Company has been working with GiveMeTap to provide drinking water sources in rural parts of the
Upper West Region of Ghana. In FY23, we funded six water pumps for a total of 43 pumps, improving safe water access to more than 40,0000 people since our partnership
began. We are also proud to expand our goal to fund 100 pumps by 2026.
Impact of the engagement and measures of success
Success is measured through the number of pumps funded by the Company.

Ralph Lauren is a partner in the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) Programme, a cross-sector coalition aimed at advancing the industry toward zero discharge of
hazardous chemicals. Through this partnership, we collaborate with peers and experts to eliminate the use and discharge of these chemicals across the apparel supply chain. We
adopt the ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) and ZDHC-approved Chemical Inventory List Management Tools to enable our suppliers to track and report on
all chemicals used in the creation of our products and prioritize the substitution of harmful chemicals with MRSL-conformant, safer alternatives.
In FY23, we continued to expand our visibility into chemical products used in our manufacturing supply chain, as well as their conformance status with the MRSL. We gained visibility
of chemical inventories and MRSL conformance status of Tier 1 manufacturing facilities that represents 79% of our business spend, compared to 72% last year. Of the chemicals
reported, 84% conform with the MRSL. In our Tier 2 supply chain, we have chemical visibility on 52% of our woven, knit and sweater material business spend. 88% of the chemicals
reported conforms with the MRSL. We are working closely with suppliers to achieve full MRSL conformance by 2025 and beyond.

Water is critical for communities and ecosystems to thrive and is also an essential resource for our business. Inorganic pollutants can potentially impact water quality, and
aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity. Restricted Substances List (ZDHC MRSL) is a list of chemical substances banned from intentional use in the processing of textile
materials, leather, rubber, foam, adhesives and trims used in textiles, apparel, and footwear industry. Chemical formulations covered by restrictions in the ZDHC MRSL
include, but are not limited to, cleaners, adhesives, paints, inks, detergents, dyes, colorants, auxiliaries, coatings and finishing agents used during raw material production,
wet processing, process machinery maintenance, wastewater treatment, sanitation, and pest control. The ZDHC MRSL goes beyond the traditional approaches to chemical
restrictions, which only apply to finished products (Restricted Substances List - RSL) and is focused on consumer safety. The MRSL approach also helps protect workers,
local communities, and the environment from the possible impacts of harmful chemicals.

We collaborate with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to advance our work in this area and set a comprehensive strategy for water stewardship and water use reductions in
our value chain. We analyzed our value chain through the WWF Water Risk Filter to map key areas of water risk and develop a water footprint. The analysis also identified
opportunities for watershed conservation, reduced water consumption, and improved community access to water. We also utilize the Maplecroft database to analyze water
risks at the country level.

Ralph Lauren leverages the WWF Water Risk filter to
assess basin and operational risk in our manufacturing
supply chain across three dimensions: physical risk,
regulatory risk, and reputational risk. This assessment
enables us to better understand the type of physical
risks such as scarcity, flooding, quality, and ecosystem
services status risks, as well as regulatory and
reputational risks facing manufacturing sites, as well as
the scale of these risks, based on basin location as
well as business activities including manufacturing and
processing.
Specifically, this assessment examines
both water availability and water quality
at the basin/catchment level, as
manufacturing processes across our
value chain depend on both sufficient
amounts of water and water of sufficient
quality. Water regulatory frameworks can
also impact water availability, cost, and
use and discharge requirements across
our value chain, so this contextual issue
is considered as well.
The assessment takes into account employees, local
communities, suppliers, and other water users at the
basin or catchment level as stakeholder groups to
provide a comprehensive picture of physical risk.
Stakeholder conflicts concerning water resources and
access to WASH services can be a driver of
reputational risk, so this contextual issue is also
considered. Water regulatory frameworks can also
impact water availability, cost, and use and discharge
requirements across our value chain, so regulators as a
stakeholder group are considered as well.
This approach, leveraging the WWF Water Risk
Filter, helps inform internal decision-making
processes by providing a lens through which we
identify priority basins and priority sites, as well as
a framework for determining and making decisions
regarding the most appropriate and impactful
actions that our company may undertake or invest
in to address contextual water risk, such as such
as conservation initiatives, nature-based
solutions, operational practice improvements, and
sourcing strategy.

(W4.1a) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
In our corporate Enterprise Risk Management process, risks rating criteria are used to assess the extent to which a risk event may affect the company’s strategy, finances,
operations, and/or reputation. Substantive financial or strategic impact is defined as any risks rated as ‘critical’ or ‘high’. A ‘critical’ risk is defined as having one or more of the
following potential impacts: (1) a very high impact on the company’s ability to meet strategic goals or execute priority initiatives; (2) leading to greater than $700 million impact
on revenue or $70 million impact on our operating margin; (3) a national, sustained, negative reputational damage with stakeholders; or (4) leading to severe and potentially
long-term impact on the operations of our business. A ‘high’ risk is defined as having one or more of the following potential impacts: (1) a high impact on the company’s ability
to meet strategic goals or execute priority initiatives; (2) leading to between $350 million and $700 million impact on revenue or between $35 million and $70 million impact on
our operating margin; (3) a national, short-term, negative reputational damage with stakeholders; or (4) leading to significant impact on the operations of our business. Risks
and opportunities described herein with the potential to have a "substantive financial or strategic impact on our business” are not necessarily ‘material’ to investors as defined

Description of response
We are committed to reducing water consumption across our value chain, and to safeguarding and improving access to water resources in our communities. We have a
public goal to achieve at least a 20% reduction in total water use across our operations and value chain by 2025. In FY23, we continued our participation in WWF’s Noyyal-
Bhavani Collective Action Program. This program is focused on ensuring that, by 2030, the Noyyal and Bhavani sub-basins of the Cauvery River in Southern India are
healthy ecosystems that ensure water security for people and nature. In addition to addressing regional textile industry impacts on freshwater, the program also focuses on
improving farming water management practices, protecting freshwater biodiversity and clearing of invasive species that harm water systems. 
We are also working to eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals in our production by 2025. We monitor our suppliers’ conformance to the ZDHC MRSL and require our
suppliers to conduct wastewater tests aligned with ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines.
We evaluate innovative technologies that enable optimization of water usage in dyeing processes. We also continued our direct collaboration with suppliers to improve
water management through the adoption of more water-efficient processing for our materials and product manufacturing. In FY23, these transitions helped our suppliers
avoid an estimated 240,000 cubic meters of water use. 
We also support organizations providing clean water for those in need. In 2022, The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation supported WaterAid, a nonprofit organization with
a focus on improving access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). The project will directly reach 21 villages in Budhni, where there is a high volume of apparel factory
workers and their families. This year, the Foundation’s grant funds establishing local water governance committees in 21 villages; providing 750 marginalized families with
piped water connection at home; repairing water and toilet infrastructure in five schools, directly benefiting 733 students; and reaching 1,874 people with WASH services
and hygiene education.

(W4.2b) Why does your organization not consider itself exposed to water risks in its direct operations with the potential to have a substantive financial or
strategic impact?
Primary reason
Please explain
Row
1
Risks exist, but
no substantive
impact
anticipated
Currently, we have not identified water risks in our direct operations with the potential to have substantive or strategic impact, considering the use of freshwater in Ralph Lauren’s own and
operated facilities does not represent high water intensity and freshwater use is not a significant business critical function within our own and operated facilities. Within our own operations,
Ralph Lauren stores and offices largely occupy leased, multi-tenant buildings, and mainly use water for drinking and sanitation purposes.

Company-specific description & strategy to realize opportunity
Ralph Lauren is working with product manufacturers to use more water-efficient production methods and to capture water data through the Sustainable Apparel Coalition
Higg Index Facility Environment Module. In FY23, we continued our partnership with the Apparel Impact Institute (Aii) to expand the Carbon Leadership Program within our
supply chain. We sponsored 48 facilities, representing approximately 47% of our raw material business spend, and 19 strategic finished goods facilities. Through the
Program, we invested in technical support for each participating manufacturing facility to develop their bespoke 2025 and 2030 carbon and water reduction roadmaps and
clear action plans with near-, medium- and long-term priorities that align with broader industry ambitions and best practices, which is of strategic interest to our business in
the face of climate change and water risk. In FY23, nominated facilities set 2025 and 2030 water reduction targets ranging up to 100%. Based on the developed roadmaps
for the nominated facilities, an aggregated saving estimation of 17 million cubic meters of water annually has been identified. 
We will continue to expand the rollout of the program in our supply chain and work closely with our suppliers to track progress and support them in capability building and
collective action programs that help overcome obstacles in implementing their action plan. 
We also continued our direct collaboration with suppliers to improve water management through the adoption of more water-efficient processing for our materials and
product manufacturing. In FY23, these transitions helped our suppliers avoid an estimated 240,000 cubic meters of water use.

Our main driver for investing in initiatives related to water efficiency improvements is to minimize our impact and reliance on freshwater resources. These initiatives may
have the potential of significant cost savings and help minimize the risk of financial loss due to water-related issues for manufacturers that implement the efficiency
measures. This enhances the business value and market competitiveness for our manufacturers, especially those with high water intensity and that are located in regions
with high water scarcity risks.

Increased supply chain resilience
Company-specific description & strategy to realize opportunity
Through our ongoing partnership with World Wildlife Fund (WWF), we have conducted a comprehensive water risk analysis, enabling us to identify water-stressed basins
in our supply chain and prioritize action and investment to improve watershed health in those locations. In FY23, we continued our participation in WWF’s Noyyal-Bhavani
Collective Action Program. This program is focused on ensuring that, by 2030, the Noyyal and Bhavani sub-basins of the Cauvery River in Southern India are healthy
ecosystems that ensure water security for people and nature. In addition to addressing regional textile industry impacts on freshwater, the program also focuses on
improving farming water management practices, protecting freshwater biodiversity and clearing of invasive species that harm water systems. In 2022, 13 textile wet
processing facilities joined the program and were evaluated for potential water management improvement opportunities and provided with recommendation plans. Through
the implementation of these improvement opportunities, the 13 sites saved a total of more than 114,330 cubic meters of water in 2022. For raw materials, we evaluated the
impacts of cotton farming as part of our water stewardship strategy, so this is of strategic interest to our business. Cotton accounts for more than 80 percent of our total
material use. Adoption of regenerative farming practices that make better use of rainfall and irrigated land presents an important opportunity for managing water risk in our
value chain. These practices increase soil fertility, water holding capacity and carbon capture; reduce erosion and pollution runoff; and create more resilience against floods

and droughts. Our company also has a goal to have 100% of our cotton be sustainably sourced by 2025. In 2021, the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation and the Soil
Health Institute (SHI) announced a founding grant to launch the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund, a unique, farmer-facing, science-based initiative that will support long-term,
sustainable cotton production in the United States. The Foundation’s founding contribution has primarily supported work in four states: Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, and
Georgia. This past year, other leading industry and philanthropic peers have joined USRCF in support of the goal to reach nine states representing 85% of U.S. cotton
production.

Ralph Lauren is committed to industry partnerships and investing in scalable, innovative technologies that enable further efficiencies in processes, material usage, water,
and energy consumption. These initiatives help unlock opportunities in our value chain to reduce reliance in freshwater resources while also offering innovative products to
our customers. Our water stewardship strategy includes development of lower impact products and materials. We continue to work towards increasing the use of recycled
content for both synthetic and natural fibers. Our strategy also includes the use of regeneratively grown fibers and materials to support soil health. In FY23, 89% of our units
produced met at least one of our sustainable material criteria—up from 77% in FY22. Last year we announced a comprehensive circularity strategy to further advance
sustainability goals. We’re working on using the principles of Cradle to Cradle® (C2C) as foundational inspiration for design, development, manufacturing, packaging and
the post-sale experience. In FY23, we launched our C2C Certified® Gold Cashmere Sweater, an iconic product made to be worn, loved and live on responsibly for
generations to come. Available in Men’s Purple Label and Women’s Collection brands, the first-of-its-kind luxury crewneck cashmere sweater is the first of five iconic Ralph
Lauren products that we committed to have C2C Certified® by 2025. At least one additional product will be submitted for certification in 2023. We also plan to continue
working towards our goal of offering high-quality products made with 100% recycled cotton by 2025 and investing in scaling innovative technologies and regenerative
practices to advance the circular economy by 2025.

Ralph Lauren takes a holistic approach to water stewardship. Our water stewardship strategy is aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement, the UN Global Compact and SDG6.
We have a public goal to achieve at least a 20% reduction in total water use across our operations and value chain by 2025. We look to conserve water in our operations,
protect its sources, responsibly manage wastewater and help improve community access to this fundamental resource. Through our ongoing partnership with WWF, we have
conducted a comprehensive water risk analysis, enabling us to identify water-stressed basins in our supply chain and prioritize action and investment to improve watershed
health in those locations. We are also working to eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals in our production by 2025. We monitor our suppliers’ conformance to the ZDHC
MRSL and require our suppliers to conduct wastewater tests aligned with ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines . We incorporated suppliers’ water, chemical, and wastewater
management KPIs in our Supplier Engagement Strategy and supplier scorecard that informs the supplier segmentation and business (procurement) decisions. These KPIs are
considered alongside other KPIs such as climate, citizenship, business execution, and quality. We collaborate with our suppliers through the Aii Carbon Leadership Program to
develop roadmap for climate and water impact reduction.
On innovation, we are developing a platform for technologies that drive water efficiency in wet processing. We evaluate innovative technologies that enable optimization of
water usage in dyeing processes, which is a major contributor in water usage in our sector. We also continued our direct collaboration with suppliers to improve water
management through the adoption of more water-efficient processing for our materials and product manufacturing. In FY23, these transitions helped our suppliers avoid an
estimated 240,000 cubic meters of water use.
In communities worldwide, access to safe water remains a challenge; globally, one in three people do not have access to safe drinking water. We are working to help end this
disparity by supporting organizations providing clean water sources for those in need. As part of this effort, we continued our partnerships with organizations focused on
community access and WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) solutions, based on local needs.

Ralph Lauren’s Global Citizenship & Sustainability governance is integrated across all levels of our organization. Our Board of Directors is responsible for formal governance of
Global Citizenship & Sustainability. The Nominating, Governance, Citizenship and Sustainability Committee of the Board oversees our environmental, social and governance
(ESG) risks and opportunities; receives quarterly updates; reviews initiatives, goals, and policies; and makes recommendations to the Board on ESG matters. We regularly
conduct materiality assessments to help identify and prioritize the citizenship and sustainability issues, risks, and opportunities that matter most to our business and stakeholders,
including water-related issues. Within our governance structure, we have created the Water Stewardship Working Group, dedicated to driving progress on our water stewardship
commitment and KPIs. In terms of long-term business objectives, we have set our water-related commitment across our material and finished goods manufacturing, supply chain,
and direct operations. Our goal is to achieve at least a 20 percent reduction in total water use across our operations and value chain compared to a FY20 baseline by 2025. In our
strategic business growth plan, we integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business principles and use sustainability KPIs as one of the metrics for measuring the success
of our long-term business objectives.

Water is critical for communities and ecosystems to thrive and is also an essential resource for our business. We look to conserve water in our operations, protect its sources,
responsibly manage wastewater and help improve community access to this fundamental resource. We set medium- to long-term goals for climate and water, which we believe
align our trajectory towards our long-term objectives. In FY23, we continued our participation in WWF’s Noyyal-Bhavani Collective Action Program. We monitor our broader supply
chain water performance through the Higg FEM and collaborate with the Aii to identify opportunities for efﬁciency in energy, chemical, and water use. We continued to expand our
support to help our partners set facility-level water reduction targets through the Carbon Leadership Program. Through the program, nominated facilities set 2025 and 2030 water
reduction targets ranging up to 100%. Based on the roadmaps developed by the nominated facilities, an aggregated saving estimation of 17 million m3 of water annually has
been identified. We also adopted the ZDHC MRSL and collaborate with industry to eliminate the use and discharge of hazardous chemicals across the apparel supply chain. Our
raw material water strategy includes accelerating the adoption of regenerative cotton farming practices and working towards achieving 100% sustainably sourced cotton by 2025.
We also plan to invest in scalable, innovative technologies that enable further water efficiencies.

The Finance and the Nominating, Governance & Sustainability Committees of our Board advise on the incorporation of goals into our corporate strategy and business initiatives
that influence corporate citizenship and sustainability. As part of our financial planning, we have a portion of our budget dedicated to water-related programs. We financed and
collaborated with Better Cotton, WWF, Aii, and organizations that focus on watershed health and community WASH solutions. In FY23, Ralph Lauren became a member of the
U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol, which helps farmers transition to more sustainable cotton cultivation practices and enables growers to measure the environmental impacts of their
operation to support continuous improvement. It provides quantifiable, verifiable goals in six key sustainability metrics, including water management. Through our work with WWF,
we are helping to create healthier eco-systems and addressing water issues at basin-level. In partnership with Aii, our suppliers have identified the opportunities to reduce energy,
chemical, and water use. Since 2018, the Company has been working with GiveMeTap to provide drinking water sources in rural communities in the Upper West Region of
Ghana. In FY23, we funded 6 water pumps for a total of 43 pumps, improving safe water access to approximately 43,000 people since our partnership began. We are proud to
expand our goal to fund 100 pumps by 2026.

Please explain
Ralph Lauren primarily uses freshwater in our own and operated facilities, including retail locations, offices, and distribution centers, for drinking and sanitation purposes.
These facilities are not water-intensive in comparison to the supply chain. Therefore, water-related CAPEX and OPEX has not changed substantively year over year. We
also do not anticipate significant changes in capital and operational expenditure related to water use in our operations.

Water is critical for communities and ecosystems to thrive and is also an essential resource for our business. Our industry depends on water, from irrigation for fiber crop
cultivation to dyeing and washing processes in manufacturing to management of our owned and operated facilities. As a result, we look to conserve water in our operations,
protect its sources, responsibly manage wastewater and help improve community access to this fundamental resource. Our goal is to achieve at least a 20% reduction in
total water use across our operations and value chain, compared to a FY20 baseline, by 2025. In FY23, our water footprint was 11,150,603 m3 — a 25% reduction
compared to FY20. This reduction was driven by production volumes decreasing by 33% compared to FY20, which contributed significantly to our supply chain water
consumption, as well as improved visibility into supplier water consumption. In parallel, we continued our direct collaboration with suppliers to improve water management
through the adoption of more water-efficient processing for our materials and product manufacturing. In FY23, these transitions helped our suppliers avoid over 240,000
cubic meters of water use.

Aligned with the ZDHC approach to confirm that MRSL substances are not intentionally used, we require manufacturing facilities with wet processing to test their
wastewater output against the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines and share results on the ZDHC Gateway portal. Among our facilities, 66% of Tier 1 and 56% of Tier 2 (by
business spend) have performed wastewater tests in accordance with the Guidelines; of these 83% comply with the ZDHC requirement (compared to 72% in FY21), with
99.8% of the substances screened compliant with the ZDHC standard. We are working closely with suppliers to achieve full MRSL conformance by 2025 and beyond. Note
that base year figure, target year figure, and reporting year figure are percentages (72%, 100%, and 83% respectively).

We use plastics in packaging items used directly for our products and in transporting our products from suppliers to our end customer. We consider packaging a component of the
product and are working toward using materials that reduce environmental impact and minimize waste. In FY23, we were able to make significant progress toward our goal of packaging
material sustainability with a full transition to polybags with 100% recycled content from all key suppliers. On RalphLauren.com, we offer a reduced packaging option that gives
consumers the ability to remove plastic or paper inserts, hangers, garment bags, promotional materials and paper invoices from their orders. In FY23, we continued to remove and
recycle all polybags from reduced packaging orders, which represented about 9% of all orders placed in North America through RalphLauren.com.
We are proud to have diverted 92% of waste from landfill and incineration across our distribution centers (DCs), meeting the Zero Waste International Alliance definition of zero waste.
Many efforts contributed to this milestone, including the FY23 installation of balers at two of our DCs to increase plastic recycling. 
We also use some amounts of plastics in our products in the form of materials such as polyester, nylon, etc. In FY23, polyester represented only 6.5% of our material use and nylon
represented only 1.6% of our material use on a units basis. We continue to prioritize recycled polyester and have a goal to achieve 100% recycled polyester by 2025 as part of our
sustainable material sourcing goals. In our supply chain, we are accelerating the elimination of Polyvinyl chloride, commonly referred to as “PVC” or “vinyl”. PVC has a wide range of
applications in our industry. Ralph Lauren commits to no longer design and develop products with PVC materials. Raw material and finished goods suppliers and licensee partners are
expected to ensure all materials developed and used in Ralph Lauren products do not contain PVC.
