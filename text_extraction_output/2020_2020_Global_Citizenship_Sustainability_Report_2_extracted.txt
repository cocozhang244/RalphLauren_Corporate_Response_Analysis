DEAR STAKEHOLDERS, 
The global COVID-19 pandemic and acceleration of the movement to end racial injustice in America and around the world have powerfully 
highlighted business’ interconnectivity and responsibility to its teams, communities, consumers, partners and investors. At Ralph Lauren, we are 
challenging ourselves to re-examine how we deliver on our Purpose – to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style – 
in a way that continues to create value for all of these stakeholders. 
Within this context, and as we mark one year since the launch of our Design the Change strategy, we recognize the importance of staying true to 
the values that define us, while embracing the opportunity to listen, to engage and to evolve. 
Our mission is to create a positive impact on society and a more sustainable future. We made some notable progress this year – from achieving 
gender parity in our leadership positions, to setting science-based targets to reduce emissions across the Company and value chain by 30 percent 
by 2030. However, in this profound inflection point in human history, our mission takes on new meaning, and we recognize that there is greater, 
deeper work ahead. 
As we continue our journey, we will take from this time both lessons and inspiration and weave them into the spirit of optimism, togetherness and 
caring that are at the heart of our beliefs — things that are beautiful, that last and that give us hope.

Global Citizenship & Sustainability at Ralph Lauren
For more than 50 years, Ralph Lauren has inspired the dream of a better life through authenticity
and timeless style, and we approach citizenship & sustainability with this in mind. This
core purpose informs our every day at Ralph Lauren and extends across our entire business. It is
inextricably linked to how we create a better future for our Company, the people we come into
contact with and the world.
One year ago, we launched our renewed citizenship and sustainability strategy, Design the Change. 
Our strategy was built on the values and purpose that have defined our business for more than half 
a century, and it is based on our belief that, together with our industry, we can deliver the change 
required to create a positive impact in society and a more sustainable future. 
When we set out on our journey to Design the Change, we set ambitious goals and dedicated 
ourselves to integrating our strategy into every part of our business with a clear focus on three 
pillars: Creating Timeless Style, Protecting the Environment and Championing Better Lives. 
We are one year into our journey and while we, along with the world, face an unprecedented 
challenge and global crisis, we are optimistic about the future and are committed to doing what we 
can to create a better tomorrow.  
Introduction
“Our Company is built on not what we did yesterday or 
even today, but what we dream of for tomorrow.”

DESIGN THE CHANGE 
Design the Change accelerates our work across Global Citizenship & Sustainability. Fundamentally, 
we believe that, together with our industry, we can deliver the change required to create a positive 
impact in society and a more sustainable future. In June 2020, Ralph Lauren signed onto the United 
Nations Global Compact, joining other companies across industries committed to implementing 
universal sustainability principles. 
Through Design the Change we: 
•	 Create Timeless Style: We believe one of our greatest commitments to sustainability is designing 
products worn and loved and made to last. We are committed to responsible sourcing and 
using state-of-the-art materials that allow us to create our products more sustainably, without 
compromising the quality we’re known for. 
•	 Protect the Environment: We’re using partnerships and technology to reduce the environmental 
impact of our operations and supply chain across energy, emissions, water and waste. We believe 
collaboration is key to finding solutions, which is why we joined leading groups and support 
nonprofits dedicated to mitigating the environmental impacts of business.
•	 Champion Better Lives: We aim to positively affect the lives of those touched by our business, 
including people in our communities, workforce and supply chain.  
“We are proud of the progress we have made since the launch 
of our Design the Change strategy last year and will continue to 
deepen our work, building on our strategies with clear targets 
and credible partnerships to effect meaningful change in our 
business and the wider world.”

Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement
In FY19, we conducted a materiality assessment to help identify and prioritize the sustainability issues, 
risks and opportunities that matter the most to our business and stakeholders. The assessment 
was conducted by a third party and included extensive engagement with internal and external 
stakeholders including employees, selected licensees, suppliers, partners, NGOs and consumers. 
Based on this assessment, we set goals for each of our priority material issues as well as selected 
issues in other categories. These goals are shared throughout the report. 
Global Citizenship & Sustainability Governance
 
Formal governance of Global Citizenship & Sustainability at Ralph Lauren sits with our Board of 
Directors (the Board). The Nominating, Governance, Citizenship & Sustainability Committee (the 
Nominating Committee) of the Board has oversight of our environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) risks and opportunities. 
The Nominating Committee receives quarterly updates, reviews initiatives, goals and policies and 
makes recommendations to the Board on ESG matters. Each quarterly update to the Nominating 
Committee also includes a deep dive on an ESG topic, allowing the members to bring their 
expertise to the subject at hand. The Finance Committee of the Board and the Nominating 
Committee advise on the incorporation of goals into our corporate strategy and engagement 
on those business initiatives that influence corporate citizenship and sustainability. The Audit 
Committee of the Board reviews ESG risks as part of its overall Enterprise Risk Management 
review. 
The full Board receives a report on citizenship and sustainability progress at least once annually 
and reviews the Company’s annual Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report.  
To further drive Company engagement, our Global Citizenship & Sustainability Senior Steering 
Committee meets monthly to prioritize and resource our approach in this area. The steering 
committee—composed of leaders from across the Company—are responsible for defining, tracking 
and championing this work with the teams. It is chaired by our Chief Sustainability Officer, who 
also oversees our sustainability program.

All of our design, production and merchant teams will receive annual training on 
sustainable, circular, inclusive and culturally aware design
Sustainable Product Design 
We have embarked on a transformation in how we approach product sustainability, beginning with 
a fundamental rethink of our mindset. Everything that goes into making our products, from ideation 
to materials, is open to challenge and up for innovation. As part of our Design the Change strategy, 
we are educating employees on the foundations of sustainable design. In FY20, we began the 
development of workshop content, e-learning modules and other tools to provide structured learning 
for our teams as they create sustainable products in tune with Ralph Lauren’s core attributes of 
timelessness, authenticity and quality.
We developed the training program in collaboration with external experts and educators, focusing 
on foundational, raw materials and job-specific aspects of sustainable product design. Learning 
opportunities will be offered across five formats to maximize participation:
•	
Instructor-led training
•	
Required independent e-learning
•	
Expert guest speakers 
•	
Evergreen tools and resources 
•	
Experiential learning 
We commit to designing more sustainable products and experiences 
by sourcing responsibly, manufacturing efficiently and investing in 
innovation to advance these efforts.
2020 GOAL
By the end of 2020, all of our design, production and merchant teams—totaling nearly 1,000 
employees—will participate in the training.  In FY21, we will expand the resource internally and 
continue to create new modules to remain up-to-date with relevant sustainability and citizenship 
issues and opportunities, as well as innovations, emerging standards and best practices.

GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP & SUSTAINABLITY REPORT | CREATE TIMELESS STYLE
Cultural Awareness 
We strive to create and communicate with respect and we continue to 
educate our teams and celebrate the cultures and influences that 
inspire our brands.
Our designs are inspired by the world around us, including the landscapes, people and places we see 
each day. The breadth and reach of our brands across generations and cultures create a style that is 
authentic, timeless and truly personal. We take seriously our responsibility to use the inspiration that 
captivates our imagination in a way that is culturally aware and appropriate. 
As part of our sustainable design goal, we committed to training all of our design, production and 
merchant teams on cultural awareness. This past year, we created a custom educational program for 
our teams that included in-person workshops as well as remote learning modules covering Native 
American cultural awareness among other topics and sources of inspiration. More than 200 team 
members have already participated, and moving forward, the program will be expanded across 
additional teams, require annual re-certification, and be included in new employee onboarding.
 
Beyond our educational program, our work in this area is driven by our Cultural Awareness Guidelines, 
which we update annually with new insights and reflections. In the last year, we formally established 
an internal council with team members that brings diverse perspectives and expertise to inform 
and advise on the guidelines, and ensures that cultural awareness is integrated from concept design 
through to marketing campaigns. Our guidelines are distributed and reviewed with all teams that 
have a role in creating our products and brand image, including our design, advertising and 
marketing departments.
Our purpose-led commitment to authenticity guides our desire to ensure that the sources of our 
inspirations are respected and strengthened when they are represented through our brand. Our 
advisors, who support our work in cultural awareness, are some of the most respected Native 
American organizations in the U.S.: the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian 
and the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health.

Sourcing & Traceability 
Our sustainability journey is a story of collaboration and shared ambition. We are forming deeper 
partnerships with core suppliers to solve long-standing sustainability challenges.
We recognize that making a meaningful positive impact will require continuous engagement with 
our suppliers. As times and expectations evolve, the evaluation of the relationship and the level of 
engagement expand. Working with partners that share the same values and perspectives enables 
better results for our business, for our communities and for the environment. 
In FY20, we launched our new Supplier Engagement Strategy to establish and maintain
collaborative partnerships and systems that foster increased transparency and accountability. Our 
Supplier Engagement Strategy is built on our long-term strategic approach for value creation. Our 
segmentation principles and criteria are based on business execution, citizenship and sustainability, 
and product integrity. 
Business results are evaluated through measured performance as well as conversations that allow 
two-way feedback so we can improve together. Product Integrity is assessed and secured at 
various stages of our value chain operations through a robust Global Testing and Quality Assurance 
Program. We built long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with partners that share our values, 
are committed to continuous improvement and provide the best products to our consumers while 
protecting the environment and enhancing the lives of people who contribute to it. 
During FY20, we worked with our strategic and key suppliers to set social and environmental 
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy drives transparency and efficiency, 
while building partnerships to deliver mutual long-term positive 
impacts across our supply chain.

targets to help us make progress toward our goals and put in place performance expectations 
and detailed methods for data collection. To support learning and understanding, we conducted a 
survey with supplier partners on social and environmental issues. The evaluations, expectations and 
commitments are shared with our strategic and key suppliers, and actions and road maps are shared 
to track progress. 
Looking ahead, we are developing a supplier relationship management tool to distribute to
our strategic and key suppliers, factories and fabric mills in 2021. The tool aims to deepen our
relationships, secure transparency and facilitate communications. We will continue to host our
Biannual Supplier Summits to encourage open dialogue about our priorities, learnings, opportunities 
and challenges and how we can partner together to continue to create value and uphold our 
standards.
By 2022, we aim for 80 percent of our business to be with strategic and key suppliers. As of FY20, 
that figure is at 47 percent.

Cotton
FY20 MATERIAL USE*
Across the apparel industry, more than 97 percent of the materials used are from virgin sources, 
which is resource-intensive to produce. As a brand with a deep history in quality and authenticity, 
materials have always mattered to us. We’ve prioritized durability, craftsmanship and performance 
to create products that stand the test of time. Since setting our 2025 goals for our key raw materials 
(cotton, wool, cashmere, leather, viscose, polyester and down), we have continued to refine our 
sustainable sourcing criteria. The impacts that our raw material sourcing have on water, land use, 
animal welfare and labor practices are just some of the reasons this is such an important part of our 
Design the Change strategy. In addition to working to meet the sustainability criteria we have set 
for each of our key raw materials, we are continually exploring and assessing sustainable material 
innovations with a focus on reducing our negative impacts and scaling our positive impacts.
Our raw material sourcing strategy is guided by our commitment to sustainability and ensuring 
visibility and influence in our supply chains through traceability efforts. In FY20, we created a 
sustainable raw material road map to outline the pathway to achieving our 2025 goals. We have 
already begun to make progress against our road map, increasing the volumes of more sustainable 
cotton, polyester and leather used across our brands and products. 
We are working to develop systems and protocols to track and measure the total volume (by weight) 
of sustainable materials as a portion of total raw materials sourced. Until these measures are in place, 
we will track our progress in terms of the number of units that use a material with a sustainability 
attribute. In FY20, 11 percent of units met our sustainability criteria for cotton, polyester or wool. 
Sustainable Materials
We focus on integrating social, ethical and environmental factors in the 
process of developing and sourcing our key raw materials.
100 percent of our key materials will be sustainably sourced1
2025 GOAL
*In FY20, we expanded our assessment of raw material use from apparel to other products such as home, footwear and accessories. Material 
use for these categories was previously not available and therefore was not included in the material use data shared in the FY19 Global 
Citizenship & Sustainability Report. Percentages do not add up to 100 percent due to rounding.
**Primarily includes additional materials used in our accessory and footwear products.
1 We define ”sustainably sourced” with specific standards and certifications for each raw material we have set goals for: cotton, wool, cashmere, 
leather, polyester, viscose and down. We leverage trusted, third-party standards such as the Responsible Wool and Down Standards. 
Although animal-derived materials only make up a small portion of our total material use 
(approximately 2 percent), and are primarily by-products from other industries, we remain committed 
to ensuring the respectful treatment and well-being of animals. Our Animal Welfare Policy guides our 
teams in sourcing these materials only from responsible suppliers. In FY20 we made great progress 
on our sustainable material goals for down, wool and cashmere, furthering the introduction of third-
party animal welfare and sustainability standards.
In the coming year, we will increase our use of sustainable materials through the partnerships, 
innovations and programs described below.  
100 percent of animal-derived materials—as covered in our animal welfare 
policy—will be certified or traceable

COTTON
By 2025, 100 percent of our cotton will be sustainably sourced, which we define as cotton that is 
either: from the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), Fair Trade certified, organic, recycled, transitional or 
aligned to the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol. 
Cotton is our primary material, accounting for 82 percent of our total material use. In FY20, 13 
percent of our total cotton units met our sustainable sourcing criteria, putting us on track to meet 
our 2025 goal. We are focused on transitioning our core products, such as polos, knits, chinos and 
shirts, to sustainably sourced cotton first. In FY20, 41 percent of these core products (as measured by 
units) used sustainably sourced cotton.
To help us sustainably source our cotton, we became members of the BCI in support of their mission 
to address the environmental, social and economic issues associated with growing cotton. In 2019, 
we sourced 6,500 tonnes of Better Cotton, which is equivalent to an estimated 8 percent of our total 
cotton use.2 
This year, we updated our definition of sustainable cotton by replacing U.S.-grown cotton with U.S. 
Cotton Trust Protocol. This change brings a needed third-party standard to cotton grown in the U.S. 
We also added “Fair Trade certified” to round out our definition of sustainable cotton.
2 Eight percent is a percentage of our total estimated cotton lint consumption for FY20 and not based on unit estimations which are 
used to calculate the percent of our total units that are using more sustainable cotton.
3 According to data provided by REPREVE
4 This number was determined based on data provided by Primaloft and First Mile for our branded recycled polyester. For our generic 
GRS-certified recycled polyester, data is based on the bottle consumption conversion provided by the mill.
POLYESTER
By 2025, 100 percent of the polyester we source will be recycled polyester.
Currently, polyester only makes up 6 percent of our total material use. As of FY20, 1 percent of 
our polyester was recycled as we began making the transition from virgin polyester. We have 
incorporated recycled polyester in over 100 styles, including our Earth Polo, which is made 
entirely from fiber derived from postconsumer-recycled ocean-bound plastic bottles. The Earth 
Polo is produced in partnership with First Mile, an organization with a global mission focused 
on sustainability and positive social impact. First Mile works with entrepreneurs in low-income 
communities to collect the recyclable plastic bottles, which are then processed using unique and 
eco-friendly manufacturing techniques.
The transition to recycled polyester is significant. It uses 45 percent less energy and emits 30 
percent less carbon dioxide compared to virgin polyester.3 The introduction of recycled polyester 
into our materials use is part of our commitment to use 170 million recycled plastic bottles in our 
products and packaging by 2025. In FY20 alone, we repurposed more than 20 million recycled 
bottles.4
In FY20 alone, we repurposed more than 20 million recycled bottles
In FY20, 13 percent of our total cotton units met our sustainable sourcing 
criteria, putting us on track to meet our 2025 goal

NYLON
We have focused on transitioning to recycled nylon for shells and other fabrics that are 100 percent 
nylon. Most of our Polo outerwear styles use recycled materials. In select RLX outerwear styles, 
we have started adopting Econyl®—a 100 percent regenerated nylon made from pre- and post-
consumer waste like fishing nets, industrial plastic waste and fabric scraps.
VISCOSE
By 2025, 100 percent of our viscose will be sustainably sourced and verified through CanopyStyle
 audits.
The sourcing of viscose, a plant-derived fiber, has been connected to the deforestation of 
ancient and endangered forests. We stand with many industry peers and have communicated 
our expectation to suppliers that any viscose used in our products does not contribute to 
deforestation. We recently formalized our commitment to sustainably sourcing viscose with the 
publication of our Forest Protection Policy.
Ralph Lauren is committed to achieving the highest level of transparency and sustainability within 
its viscose supply chain. Beginning in FY21, Ralph Lauren will be asking suppliers to provide 
information on the origin of cellulosic fibers to evaluate the associated sourcing risk. We will also 
ask suppliers to put in place their own sourcing policies which commit them to not source fibers 
from ancient and endangered forests or controversial sources. Finally, we will partner with suppliers 
to confirm the status of our viscose supply chain and use the results of the CanopyStyle audit to 
create a roadmap to achieve our 2025 goal, including prioritizing the use of the highest-ranked 
fiber producers as published in Canopy’s annual Hot Button Report.
LEATHER
By 2025, 100 percent of our leather will be sourced from Leather Working Group (LWG)-certified 
tanneries, with the aim that all tanneries achieve LWG Gold certification by 2030. 
To achieve gold certification, our tanneries must rank in the highest bracket across critical 
sustainability issues such as restricted substances and water use. As of FY20, 43 percent of our 
leather suppliers are certified by LWG (gold, silver or bronze rating), accounting for 90 percent of our 
total leather use. 
While our current sustainable leather goal is focused on tanneries, our long-term ambition is to 
trace our leather back to the farm to verify their animal welfare practices and impacts on land use, 
specifically deforestation. Through our membership in the Textile Exchange, we are supporting the 
burgeoning work of the Leather Impact Accelerator, a program dedicated to aligning members of 
the leather value chain to achieve meaningful sustainable impacts. This approach aligns with our 
commitment to the G7 Fashion Pact, which aims to reduce the environmental impact of the apparel 
industry, including a focus on stopping the decline of biodiversity. 
In select RLX outerwear styles, we have started adopting Econyl®—a 100 
percent regenerated nylon made from pre- and post-consumer waste

DOWN 
Currently, all of the down we source for products manufactured by Ralph Lauren suppliers is 
certified by the Responsible Down Standard (RDS) or the Traceable Down Standard (TDS).
WOOL  
By 2025, all of our wool will either be recycled or certified by the Responsible Wool Standard (RWS). 
In FY20, we continued incorporating recycled and RWS-certified wool into selected products. We 
also actively engaged with our suppliers to better understand the barriers associated with sourcing 
RWS wool in various geographies, with the aim of increasing the availability of this wool in the future. 
We are also exploring the use of other certified wools, such as Nativa and Cradle to Cradle, that 
meet RWS standards for animal welfare and take additional social and environmental impacts into 
consideration.
CASHMERE  
We aim to make sustainable cashmere more readily available in our supply chain. In FY20, we 
made progress toward transparency by beginning to map the countries of origin for our cashmere. 
We are also engaging with the Sustainable Fibre Alliance and the Textile Exchanges’ Responsible 
Cashmere Round Table to identify the best avenues to advance the development and adoption of 
existing standards.
We are also working to incorporate recycled and Cradle to Cradle-certified cashmere into our 
products. 
All of the down we source for 
products manufactured by 
Ralph Lauren suppliers is 
certified by the Responsible Down 
Standard or the Traceable 
Down Standard
In FY20, we made significant progress in using 
alternative down from recycled materials. 
We became the first brand to incorporate a 
Primaloft® down alternative—ThermoPlume™— 
into our products. ThermoPlume™ is made 
entirely from recycled plastic bottles and 
provides the same quality and function as 
conventional down. As of FY20, ThermoPlume™ 
was incorporated into our Ralph Lauren 
packable down outerwear.

Eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals in our supply chain 
Chemical Management 
We will monitor and reduce hazardous chemical use and discharge, 
ultimately eliminating all hazardous chemicals from the manufacture 
of our products. 
2025 GOAL
Modern textile production relies on chemicals—our mission is to identify the safest substances for 
people and the environment. Guided by our Sustainable Chemical Management Policy, no chemical 
will be overlooked—if it’s a cause for concern, we seek a safer option. Responsible chemical 
management is key to meeting our social and environmental supply chain standards, and we 
believe broad industry collaboration is required to achieve widespread implementation. 
In FY20, we joined the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) Programme as Friends 
of ZDHC. The ZDHC Programme is a collaborative group of contributors and stakeholders in 
the textile and leather industry that work collectively to eliminate the usage and discharge of 
hazardous chemicals from the supply chain. We are adopting ZDHC standards and tools to guide 
the way our supply chain selects, purchases and manages chemicals. This approach will help 
reduce supplier assessment fatigue and maximize the implementation efforts.
We also partnered with the Apparel Impact Institute and five of our largest fabric mills to 
implement the Mill/impact Initiative. Through this program, the mills will have access to expert 
guidance in identifying and implementing measures to enhance on-site energy and water efficiency, 
as well as chemical management practices.
In FY20, we adopted the ZDHC manufacturing restricted substances list (MRSL) and began 
communicating to our suppliers through our vendor compliance program. The MRSL is key to 
enabling suppliers to track and report on all chemicals used in the development and manufacturing 
of our products as well as prioritize harmful chemicals for removal. In FY20, we identified 
perfluorocarbons (PFCs) for removal from our garments. PFCs are used in apparel production to 
create high-performance water-repellant materials but if not managed correctly, could lead to 
adverse impacts on people and the environment. In FY20, we began a pilot program to explore 
phasing out PFCs across all Ralph Lauren brands.
While it remains an industry challenge to achieve full visibility of chemical usage throughout the 
supply chain, we are working with our suppliers toward this objective. We are prioritizing our 
chemical transparency initiative with strategic and key suppliers, which made up 47 percent of 
our production in FY20. As we progress toward our 2025 goal, we set an interim objective with 
our strategic and key suppliers to achieve full chemical transparency by the end of 2020. We also 
identified a chemical inventory management tool to help suppliers track and directly report the 
chemicals used in production against the ZDHC MRSL. We will begin rolling this tool out to our 
strategic, selected key suppliers and fabric mills next year.
SUSTAINABLE DENIM 
In addition to our goal to source sustainable cotton 
for all of our denim, discussed on page 12, in FY20, we 
began our transition to sustainable denim production 
across our global facilities. Key initiatives include: 
•	 Reducing our use of potassium permanganate in all 
of our denim laundries, with the goal of reaching zero
•	 Increasing laser technology applications to replace 
manual sanding in selected facilities 
•	 Replacing the use of pumice stones with alternative 
abrasives including synthetic stones or switching to 
enzyme processes for our core denim washes, with 
the goal of eliminating pumice stones by 2025

Our Carbon Strategy
Carbon and Energy
Ralph Lauren is supporting a wave of change in our industry, taking action to reduce the climate 
impact of our business and our value chain. There is a consensus amongst industry leaders—we 
must move quickly and collaboratively to decarbonize the fashion sector, which is responsible for 
10 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We are working with coalition groups and 
industry experts to reduce our carbon footprint. 
We are signatories to the We Are Still In declaration and the UN Fashion Industry Charter for 
Climate Action, pledging to limit our emissions in line with the Paris Agreement goals. We are also 
members of the G7 Fashion Pact, a group of fashion leaders working to stop global warming, restore 
biodiversity and protect the oceans. As part of our carbon reduction strategy, we joined RE100 and 
committed to the goal of powering our owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores 
with 100 percent renewable electricity by 2025.
GHG REDUCTION GOAL
In FY20, we established a science-based target to reduce our absolute GHG emissions by 30 percent 
by 2030, compared to 2020 levels. This target includes reducing emissions from our operations 
(Scope 1 and 2) by sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity and reducing emissions from our 
supply chain (Scope 3).  
We commit to addressing the issue of global climate change and the 
contributing impacts of our business by reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions across our value chain. 
Our goal was approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), indicating that our ambitions 
align with reduction pathways to limit global temperature rise across the planet to 1.5°C. By selecting 
FY20 as our baseline, we leveraged our most accurate carbon data and aligned our goal to SBTi 
guidelines.5  The goal is consistent with our commitment as a signatory to the UN Fashion Industry 
Charter for Climate Action and our membership in RE100. 
Setting a value chain carbon reduction target is a significant milestone for Ralph Lauren. We believe 
that companies must establish ambitious, science-based targets to ensure that society averts the 
disruptive effects of climate change. Our commitment represents our long-standing values, reflects 
the evolution of our thinking and will help decarbonize the fashion industry.  
 
We are working on a detailed plan to implement our goal by sourcing renewable energy for our 
operations and reducing the carbon intensity of manufacturing and production in our supply chain. 
Thirty percent reduction in absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 2030 
compared to a FY20 baseline. As part of this goal, Ralph Lauren also commits 
to the goal of sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity by 2025.
SCIENCE-BASED TARGET
5 SBTi guidelines recommend that the most recent year is used as a baseline.

OUR FOOTPRINT
A comprehensive carbon footprint is the foundation for our science-based target. In FY20, we 
improved our methodology to ensure that our calculations are representative of our value chain and 
consistent year-over-year. For the first time, we expanded our footprint to include our supply chain 
emissions, which account for 92 percent of our total footprint, with Scope 1 and 2 accounting for the 
remaining 8 percent.
Our Scope 1 and 2 carbon footprint consists primarily of emissions from electricity and fuels for 
heating and cooling the facilities in our direct operations and a smaller portion due to refrigerant 
emissions. In FY20, our operational energy consumption was 319,586 MWh, which resulted in 126,665 
MTCO2e. The energy intensity of our owned and operated stores was 36.3 kWh/sq ft. 
Our Scope 3 carbon footprint consists of indirect emissions from our global supply chain. In FY20, 
our total Scope 3 emissions were 1,538,079 MTCO2e. 
In future reports, we will share progress toward our 2030 GHG reduction goal.
SOURCING RENEWABLE ENERGY
Around the globe, renewable energy is increasingly available and cost-competitive compared to 
conventional power sources. Our strategy for achieving our Scope 1 and 2 GHG reduction goal 
is focused primarily on renewable energy. In FY20, we joined RE100 and committed to the goal 
of powering our owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100 percent 
renewable electricity by 2025. 
To achieve this goal, we plan to implement virtual power purchase agreements in North America and 
assess our U.S. locations for onsite solar power installations. For our remaining electricity use, we plan 
to purchase high-quality green electricity credits, such as renewable energy certificates. As of FY20, 
2 percent of electricity used in our operations was from renewable sources. We expect this number 
to significantly increase as we put our renewable energy strategy into action. 
ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN STORES
We use environmental management systems to monitor and control energy-intensive building 
components including lighting, heating and cooling. In FY20, we opened 11 stores globally designed 
with LED lighting and we retrofitted the lighting in 16 existing stores to be more energy efficient. In 
FY21, we will retrofit the lighting at the remainder of our Polo and Ralph Lauren branded stores in 
North America and we are evaluating additional opportunities at our Asian and European stores. In 
FY20, our stores consumed 190,324 MWh and their carbon intensity was 
0.014 MTCO2e/sq ft.

system did not allow for easy recalculation of previous years. Therefore, we chose to use FY20 as our baseline to ensure accuracy and 
full inclusion of all emissions sources. Previously reported carbon data, which leveraged a different methodology, is available in the 2019 
Global Citizenship & Sustainability report.

By mapping our Scope 3 footprint, we identified priority areas for emissions reduction, including raw 
material manufacturing and garment finishing where the final touches are added to our products.
TIER 1 SUPPLIERS
We are gathering environmental data, including energy use, from tier 1 suppliers through the 
Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) Higg Facility Environmental Module. The data will inform how 
we reduce the carbon emissions associated with our supply chain. As of FY20, 216 supplier facilities 
provided energy use and emissions data, representing an estimated 63 percent of our total supply 
chain spend.
In FY21, we will collect data from more suppliers and create road maps to help reduce our supply 
chain carbon footprint, starting with our strategic and key suppliers.6  
TIER 2 FABRIC MILLS
In FY20, we partnered with five of the largest fabric mills we work with to help them join the Apparel 
Impact Institute (AII) Mill/impact program. Building upon the Clean by Design methodology, the 
program provides training and resources to help suppliers reduce their carbon, water and chemical 
footprint. Our participating fabric mills receive on-site visits from environmental experts, consultation 
on goal-setting and technical support for environmental impact reduction projects.
Reducing Our Supply Chain Footprint
SHIPPING OUR PRODUCTS
Product transport—including train, truck and air—is included in our Scope 3 footprint. We aim to use 
the most efficient transportation possible to mitigate cost and environmental impact when shipping 
products to our distribution centers. 
We expect our suppliers to deliver products in the most cost-efficient and environmentally friendly 
way possible. Only in rare circumstances, when production does not meet delivery deadlines and we 
are in urgent need of that supply, do we allow vendors to deliver product via air. In FY20, vendor-
managed air accounted for only 3.8 percent of total shipments, compared to 5.8 percent in FY19.
In FY20, Ralph Lauren signed the Ocean Conservancy Arctic Shipping Pledge to protect the Arctic 
marine ecosystem from the negative impacts of commercial shipping. As a signatory, Ralph Lauren 
commits not to hire carriers to ship our products through Arctic Trans-Shipment Routes. We also 
engage with organizations such as Clean Cargo, a BSR collaboration for sustainable transportation, 
and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency SmartWay program on efficient logistics.

Our Water Strategy
Water Stewardship
All life depends on water, and we can’t overstate the importance of our industry protecting this finite 
resource. We are in the process of transforming the way water is used in our supply chain, introducing 
the best new technologies that minimize consumption and protect the world’s water resources.
As of this year, our water stewardship initiatives include:
•	 Leveraging the SAC Facility Environmental Module to capture water data from our tier 1 suppliers. 
•	 Enrolling five of our tier 2 fabric mills in the Apparel Impact Institute (AII) Mill/impact program to 
reduce their environmental impact, including water use.
•	 Working with seven knit and woven manufacturers to minimize water use and improve effluent 
treatment by upgrading factory equipment. We estimate these projects helped our knit and woven 
partners avoid 168,000 cubic meters of water use in FY20. 
•	 Manufacturing all Earth Polos with a waterless dyeing technology.
•	 Reducing the use of water-intensive chemicals in the production of core denim products.
In addition, we entered into a collaboration with World Wildlife Fund to accelerate progress toward 
our goal of reducing our water use. In this first year of the collaboration, we are analyzing our water 
footprint, identifying areas of water risk, and outlining strategies to decrease our water consumption 
while also identifying opportunities to address water quality and access needs across our value chain. 
Through our partnerships with GiveMeTap and DigDeep, our water stewardship initiatives extend 
to our communities. Read more about our work to safeguard and preserve water in Community 
Engagement and Philanthropy, on page 26.
We commit to reducing water consumption across our value chain, and to 
safeguarding and preserving water resources in our communities.
Achieve at least a 20 percent reduction in total water use across our operations 
and value chain, compared to a FY20 baseline

Waste Management
We commit to integrating zero waste principles across our business. We aim 
to divert waste from landfill through increasing recycling and upcycling, 
reducing waste at its source, and implementing other best practices.
Toward our goal for zero waste, we are designing waste out of our processes, in our own business 
and throughout our supply chain.
From manufacturing to distribution centers, retail operations and events, we are identifying ways 
to replace, improve and create processes that will eliminate waste and help us progress toward our 
zero waste distribution center goal, as well as our commitment to bring zero waste principles into all 
aspects of our business and value chain. Our approach addresses waste associated with products 
and our operations.
Managing Excess Inventory
In FY20, we developed a set of guiding principles to support our waste management strategy. 
These principles were created to minimize waste, maximize the value of our products in their first 
and next life, keep all materials at their highest and best use and maintain the integrity of our 
brand throughout all of the above. To help put our principles into practice, we established a waste 
management hierarchy for inventory and commercial waste to guide decision-making across the 
organization.

EMPLOYEE ACCESS
While we have historically held employee sales of excess inventories, access has been limited to 
employees in the immediate geography of the inventory. In FY21, we will begin exploring new ways 
to provide employees access to excess inventories and are in the process of creating a pilot digital 
employee sale. 
DONATE FOR POSITIVE IMPACT
In FY20, we made donations to a number of partners across our global networks, including Delivering 
Good and Material for the Arts.
We donated over 40,000 units of products. Our donation strategy is focused on helping as many 
communities as possible where our employees and customers live and work and aligning our 
partnerships with nonprofits to that strategy. 
 
RECYCLE
Taking the learnings from a garment recycling pilot in Europe, where we recycled garments to make 
raw materials for insulation and soundproofing boards, we are continuing to find opportunities to 
recycle excess product when all other, more productive and more sustainable options have been 
explored. Textile recycling does have technical and product eligibility challenges, such as the inability 
to process blended fabrics and limited options for shoes and handbags. In FY21, we will continue to 
explore recycling options and partners. 
DISPOSITION
After we have exhausted the channels and avenues described above, we reserve product disposition 
(or destruction) as a last resort. We prioritize waste-to-energy disposal methods wherever possible. 
As visualized in our hierarchy on page 21, our aim is to reduce waste as much as possible through the 
strategies we have outlined and ultimately eliminate product disposition or destruction. 
As we look to the future, we will be ramping up our donation partnerships as well as exploring new 
recycling partners for eligible products.
PREVENT EXCESS AT SOURCE
In FY20, we started to develop a global approach to reducing inventory waste and standardized the 
steps we take to prevent excess product from becoming waste.
Accurately predicting product demand is a common challenge in our industry. As a result, in the 
traditional manufacturing model, production routinely exceeds demand. We envision a future 
where we produce only what is needed—eliminating any overproduction altogether. To do this, we 
have taken steps over the last few years to better balance our inventory with demand. We have 
continued to shorten value chain lead times and implemented agile production models, while 
applying buying techniques that more closely match manufacturing to demand. Over the last three 
years, we have produced fewer units while increasing our revenue and profit margins. This success 
shows it is possible to maintain financial performance while minimizing overproduction.
In FY20, we launched a pilot to minimize overproduction of our wholesale orders in our European 
market. Working together, our merchandising, sourcing and global manufacturing teams manage 
commitment dates to ensure that they occur after we confirm customer orders. This cut-to-sales 
model decreased the number of extra items made, and in FY21, we will implement the same process 
improvement in North America. 
PURSUE EXPANDED SALES CHANNELS
After offering our products in full price omni-channel across regions, we evaluate pursuing 
alterantive sales channels for products that are not sold within the planned time frame, including 
our outlet stores and various clearance partners around the world. 
We are also using service-based revenue models like rental platforms, also known as ‘shared closets’. We 
are on platforms including Rent the Runway and Nuuly with our Polo, Lauren and Club Monaco brands. 
MAXIMIZE PRODUCT OR MATERIAL’S NEXT LIFE 
We have begun to expand the potential “next life” opportunities for our products by expanding 
our use of re-commerce and upcycling. In FY20, we launched RE/SOURCED a uniquely curated 
collection celebrating vintage Polo with Depop and are pursuing additional vintage and resale 
opportunities for FY21 and beyond. 
Building on our various Upcycling capsules and collaborations in the past, we are continuing to find 
creative ways to use products and fabrics to make new, one-of-a-kind products.

We reduce waste at our distribution centers to drive efficiency and minimize our environmental 
impact. In FY20, we conducted a global assessment of waste generated at our distribution centers 
and calculated the baseline diversion rate across selected global sites. In FY20, we achieved 90 
percent diversion at our owned distribution centers in North America. In FY21, we will work to achieve 
similar diversion rates in our third-party-operated distribution centers in Europe and Asia. 
To reach our zero-waste goal, we recycle or reuse most of the cardboard, plastic, pallets and paper 
material that enter our facilities. We are working to ensure that every distribution center also has a 
solution in place for items such as electronics and light bulbs. In FY21, at our third-party-operated 
distribution centers in Europe and Asia, we will focus on excess inventory diversion. 
In FY20, we generated 5,507 metric tons of waste at our distribution centers and diverted 4,658
metric tons of waste from landfill. In FY21, we will work with our haulers to improve our distribution 
center diversion rate by further reducing the waste we send to landfill. One area of opportunity we 
plan to address is recycling or eliminating the hangers and polybags which our suppliers typically 
include in product shipments. 
Our retail stores continue to recycle to divert waste from landfill. In FY20, we were directly responsible 
for waste management at 86 of our retail locations, and 100 percent of our stores in North America 
continue to have recycling programs. 
Our employees want to play an active role in our sustainability program, and we are harnessing that 
energy in a new community group—the Green Ponies. Formed in FY20, the Green Ponies advance 
environmental improvements at our offices by driving internal awareness, collecting innovative ideas 
and implementing solutions. 
*Comprehensive site-specific waste data was not available for all offices and stores. Waste data was modeled for these sites.
In FY20, our distribution center diversion rate was 85 percent,

Sustainable Packaging
For more than a decade, Ralph Lauren has recognized the importance of environmentally responsible 
packaging. Our 2025 company-wide goal is to only use recyclable, reusable or sustainably sourced 
packaging materials.7 As of FY19, over half of our packaging met this criterion, with the share of 
sustainable packaging continuing to increase in FY20. 
In FY20, we took several steps toward achieving our sustainable packaging goal, including 
formalizing our Forest Protection Policy. This policy underscores our commitment to reduce the 
environmental and social impacts of our packaging. During the year, we inventoried every material 
used in our product packaging. Our top three items by volume of usage are stickers, decorative tags, 
and polybags—individual plastic bags used to protect products. Through our inventory, we identified 
over 250 unique items that met our sustainability criteria, including our recyclable tags, reusable 
shopper bags and polybags that contain 50 percent postconsumer-recycled content. 
We have identified 20 priority packaging materials that we will either stop using or transition to 
more sustainable sources. In FY20, we developed guidelines for decorative tags which will reduce 
nonessential tags and require that FSC-certified paper is used for tags that are not eliminated. 
We also worked with suppliers and other retail brands on how we can eliminate, reduce or replace 
polybags. In FY20, we piloted a program with selected suppliers to reduce the number of polybags 
used in transporting products and tested 14 alternatives to polybags including recycled content bags, 
biobased bags and bags with lower impact at end of life. 
100 percent of our packaging material will be recyclable, reusable or 
sustainably sourced
2025 GOAL
7 In FY20, we updated our goal to include reusable packaging options. Sustainably sourced includes packaging that is post consumer or 
post industrial recycled content or FSC certified.
Customers can select a reduced packaging option for any orders placed through RalphLauren.com. 
For these orders we do not include plastic or paper inserts, hangers or garment bags, promotional 
materials and paper invoices. In FY20, we proactively removed and recycled all of the polybags 
from reduced packaging orders, representing 12 percent of all orders placed through RalphLauren.com 
that year. To make this possible, we updated our customer service website, changed our packing 
process and trained employees in our customer service and distribution centers on the new 
procedure. We are also developing a reusable shipping package pilot as part of our effort to reduce 
shipping packaging waste. In FY20, we identified a viable reusable packaging solution and we plan 
to test the concept in FY21.
As of FY19, over half of our packaging was recyclable, reusable or 
sustainably sourced

CANCER CARE AND PREVENTION
For almost 20 years, the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care (RLCCC) has worked to reduce 
healthcare disparities in New York City by providing high-quality cancer prevention and treatment for 
underserved populations.
In FY20, RLCCC formally joined the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, serving vulnerable and 
minority populations and providing access to cancer screening, prevention and treatment services.
Our global Pink Pony campaign is the cornerstone of our fight against cancer. Now in its 20th year, 
Pink Pony is recognized for its contribution to raising awareness, encouraging conversation and 
education and driving donations. In FY20, the corporation donated 100 percent of sales from our 
pink “Live Love” T-shirt—totaling $2 million—to the Foundation’s Pink Pony Fund supporting cancer-
fighting organizations.
LGBTQIA+ EQUITY AND INCLUSION
Since 2003, the Foundation has proudly supported and invested in the LGBTQIA+ community. To 
further our aim of creating a culture of belonging, we partnered with the Stonewall Community 
Foundation. As the beneficiary of our gender-neutral Pride capsule, Stonewall received 100 percent 
of sales from our “Pride” T-shirt, 50 percent of sales from all other capsule items and donations 
collected at registers for a total donation of more than $338,000 in FY20. With a global reach, 
Stonewall carries out its mission of strengthening the LGBTQIA+ movement through the deployment 
of targeted, values-driven investments to impactful organizations, projects and leaders. 
ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER
Through our partnership with GiveMeTap, we donated 
$37,500 in FY20 to fund drinking water projects in rural 
Africa by providing stainless steel water bottles to our 
employees across the globe. Additionally, for every Polo-
branded bottle sold on RalphLauren.com, a minimum of 
$2 has been committed to help fund the installation of 
water pumps across rural Ghana.12 To date, the program 
has provided 13 water pumps and positively affected over 
10,000 people.
  
This year we also provided Navajo families with home 
water systems through our partnership with DigDeep, 
a nonprofit focused on increasing access to water and 
sanitation throughout the United States. 
 
Our cancer work benefits an international network of charities. The Ralph Lauren Corporation 
reinforced a long-standing partnership with The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, dating back 
to 2014, by pledging £1 million by FY22. Contributions will come from product sales, in-store 
donations and employee fundraising events and will be used to establish a research area within 
the Oak Cancer Centre which is slated to open in 2022 at The Royal Marsden in Sutton, United 
Kingdom.

GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP & SUSTAINABLITY REPORT | CHAMPION BETTER LIVES
In FY20, we reached a milestone in our diversity and inclusion (D&I) journey. We achieved our 2023 
gender parity goal for equal representation in leadership positions at the VP level and above three 
years ahead of schedule. In FY20, women held 50 percent of VP level and above positions at the 
Company. Moving forward, we will continue to uphold our Parity.org commitment to include women 
and diverse candidates in the interview process for all open VP level and above roles. 
We strive to increase opportunities for women in our workforce globally, and also for female
factory workers in our supply chain. On average, women make up half of the apparel supply chain 
workforce, yet in many markets, the vast majority of supervisor positions are held by men. 
Recognizing that we can fundamentally influence the lives of women workers (and their families) 
by helping them achieve career progression, we are committed to increasing women in factory 
leadership by 25 percent by 2025. To achieve this, in FY20 we partnered with the International 
Finance Corporation to launch the Gender Equality and Returns (GEAR) Program to provide training 
to female workers on the skills needed for supervisory roles. See Worker Empowerment and Well-
Being, on page 35, for more information on GEAR.

DIVERSE RECRUITMENT 
Our University Relations program recruits at colleges and career fairs to sustain a robust and diverse 
talent pipeline. In FY20, 59 percent of our global new hires were female, an increase of 2 percent 
compared to FY19, and 68 percent of U.S. new hires identified with one or more diverse groups, an 
increase of 2 percent compared to FY19.
We partner with nonprofits to expand opportunities for young people from marginalized or 
underserved communities. In FY20, we formed a partnership with SEO Scholars, a nonprofit that 
mentors public school students through high school and college. In FY21, we will continue to work 
with SEO students in mentorship opportunities organized with our D&I employee groups.

ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENT
We design our talent management initiatives to attract prospective employees and retain our 
valued workforce. 
We continue to offer early career opportunities through our paid internship program. In FY20, 
we enhanced our formal corporate and creative internships by extending the program to new 
international schools and increasing opportunities for direct placement post graduation. Gender, 
ethnic and socioeconomic diversity are among the criteria we use to select candidates for the 
program. 
To retain our employees, we support career mobility through development opportunities and 
by encouraging internal recruitment. The impact of this is most evident in our appointments to 
leadership roles. In FY20, 78 percent of open U.S. Director-level and above positions were filled 
with internal candidates, consistent with our FY19 levels.
Our Navigating Your Career program provides e-learning, workshops and career coaching for all 
employees. In FY20, we expanded the program to include networking events, career panels and 
open office hours with leadership. 
FOSTERING AN INCLUSIVE CULTURE 
Our Company is home to people from different backgrounds and we celebrate the varied 
perspectives they bring to Ralph Lauren. We are creating a culture where all employees have a 
sense of belonging and thrive—as individuals and as a part of our team.
 
In FY20, we joined Open to All, a national nondiscrimination coalition. By taking the Open to All 
pledge, we promise to maintain a safe and inclusive environment for people in our stores and offices.
 
As a member of the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion group, we are committed to advancing 
D&I within our industry. We are contributing to a CEO Action white paper on how the apparel 
industry can support and engage employees on D&I—from concept to the shop floor. The white 
paper will be published and shared with CEO Action signatories in FY21.
EMBEDDING DIVERSITY 
Working together to embed a culture of diversity and inclusion in our Company, our employee 
groups described below promote dialogue, help define focus areas and develop solutions.
•	 Diversity & Inclusion Synthesis Board — Our CEO and leaders from regional D&I teams advance 
our D&I strategy. 
•	 Diversity & Inclusion teams — Regionally organized teams meet regularly to address the needs 
of local employees.
•	 Ralph Lauren Communities — Ralph Lauren has five global, employee-led communities: RL Gender 
Parity, RL Pride, Generation RL, RL Mosaic and RL Wellness, Disability and Mental Health Community. 
In FY20, we hosted nearly 100 global employee events to celebrate identity and heritage in our 
community. Thirty of those events took place during Pride Month. We brought our Pride campaign 
to customers with in-store messaging and themed products that raised funding for our nonprofit 
partner Stonewall.
In FY20, Ralph Lauren was recognized 
for our workplace culture: 
In FY20, 78 percent of open U.S. Director-level and above positions were filled with 
internal candidates
In FY20, we scored 100 percent on

EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION
Training at all levels ensures that our employees know how to contribute to a healthy and inclusive 
workplace culture where they feel safe and respected at work.
In FY20, all global employees, including our Board members, completed unconscious bias training. 
In addition, all design, production and merchant teams will receive cultural awareness training by 
FY21. We continued to host the D&I Salons, a learning opportunity for Ralph Lauren Executive 
Leaders to convene with global industry and diversity experts, with FY20 content focused on 
gender parity in fashion. 
In FY21, we will expand our work with Parity.org by developing a road map for achieving gender 
parity in the retail and fashion industry. This will be published in a white paper and shared with 
industry peers who have joined our D&I Salons in the U.S. and Europe. 
We will also launch a new unconscious bias training in FY21 on allyship and advocacy, focusing on 
inclusive behaviors. 
WELLNESS, BENEFITS AND PAY EQUITY
We take a holistic view of well-being, attending to the physical, emotional, social and financial 
needs of employees and their families. Our support includes comprehensive employee resources, 
progressive benefits and competitive compensation. 
In FY20, we launched an enhanced global wellness program, THRIVE, for Ralph Lauren employees. 
The resources available through THRIVE vary by region and include flexible work arrangements, 
sabbaticals, volunteer events, exercise and mindfulness classes and educational series. We continually 
review and improve our benefits package to ensure that we are meeting the needs of our employees.
We are committed to equal pay for equal work across our Company. We take a proactive approach 
to gender pay equity and continually monitor our compensation programs to ensure fairness. 
Our approach includes a biennial assessment with a human capital management firm to analyze 
employee compensation. Our FY20 assessment confirmed that our male and female employees 
based in the U.S. receive equal pay for equal work. In FY21, we will begin expanding the assessment 
to our global workforce.
Ralph Lauren also publishes an annual U.K. Gender Pay Gap report, in line with U.K. legislation. Our 
mean and median gender pay and bonus gaps remain substantially better than U.K. average figures.
GLOBAL PEOPLE PRACTICES
Our Global People Practices team upholds the Company’s Fair Treatment Policy, managing: 
•	 Workplace Compliance — ensuring that employees and vendors comply with all workplace laws, 
regulations, and Company policies
•	 Policies and Practices — co-creating people-related policies, practices, and educating employees
•	 Progressive Work Practices — evolving policies and practices to give employees flexibility on 
where and how they work
•	 Safe and Impartial Review — handling all workplace issues in a confidential, consistent and fair 
manner
Our Fair Treatment Policy helps us maintain a professional and productive Ralph Lauren work 
environment that is free from discrimination and harassment. Anyone who is covered by the policy 
can raise a concern through our open door policy and the RL Global Hotline. We investigate, 
resolve and track concerns so we can prevent recurrence and implement proactive strategies 
throughout our organization. 
Employees must adhere to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics as well as our anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption policies. We provide training on these items annually to help employees make 
good decisions in their day-to-day work. 
INVESTING IN ALL EMPLOYEES 
Our success depends on how capable and committed our people are, so we invest in programs 
that make Ralph Lauren a great place to work. We engage employees through educational 
opportunities and feedback mechanisms which strengthen the Company from within.
Our FY20 pay equity assessment confirmed that our male and female employees

LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT 
We’ve expanded our learning and development program to build skills and prepare for the future. 
In FY20, we opened our mentorship program to all employees and launched a tuition assistance 
fund to support continuing education. More than 760 employees participated in mentorship, four 
times as many as in the prior year. In FY20, we awarded $197,000 through our new scholarship 
program to support employees enrolling in courses that build their professional skills. 
All employees can accelerate their growth through the Ralph Lauren Learning Portal and in FY20, 
92 percent completed a learning event through the platform. The portal is one way corporate 
employees can use their benefit of 10 hours of Company-sponsored learning time. 
In FY20, we continued to scale our mentorship cohort programs, RUNWAY, UNLOCK and 
BESPOKE. The 12-month, in-person learning experiences are tailored for employees at different 
levels of the organization. 
•	 BESPOKE — Available to leaders at the VP level and above, focused on developing new 
leadership skills
•	 RUNWAY — Available to people-managers, building communication and soft skills needed to 
successfully manage a team
•	 UNLOCK — Available to employees after one year at the Company, focused on ways to work 
within our culture and business
ACTING ON FEEDBACK 
In FY20, 94 percent of employees responded to our annual all employee survey. Through the survey, 
employees indicated that our top strengths inlcude our strong consumer focus and our culture of 
diversity, inclusion and respect. Employees also indicated that they feel a strong commitment and 
pride in the Ralph Lauren brand. The survey highlighted areas for improvement, such as increasing 
career advancement opportunities and decision-making responsibilities for employees in lower-level 
positions within the organization.
Due to COVID-19, employees based in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan did not participate 
in the FY20 Employee Engagement survey. We will invite employees based in these countries to 
provide their feedback in FY21 for a total global view.

Worker Empowerment 
and Well-Being
Championing Workers
We are committed to conducting our global operations ethically and 
with respect for the dignity of all people who make our products. We 
aim to enrich the quality of work and life for all workers in our supply 
chain, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to reach their full 
potential in a safe work environment.  
We appreciate and value the talent and commitment of nearly half a million factory workers in 
our supply chain who make the timeless style and quality of Ralph Lauren pieces a reality. We 
believe our efforts to enhance the lives of workers must embody, protect and promote universally 
accepted human rights, freedoms and norms.
We continuously refine our supply chain over decades to deliver the technology, flexibility and 
quality we require while respecting worker rights. During FY20, 519 factories manufactured for 
us in 40 countries. These factories in turn received materials from tier 2 suppliers, such as textiles 
from mills and dye plants. As part of our Supplier Engagement Strategy, we maintain long-standing 
relationships with our strategic and key suppliers, enabling us to partner closely and transparently 
for the benefit of the people who make our garments.

GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP & SUSTAINABLITY REPORT | CHAMPION BETTER LIVES
We take our responsibility for ensuring a safe and healthy working environment very seriously and 
continually conduct our business according to high ethical and legal standards. Our Operating 
Standards are the basis for our relationship with suppliers, communicating our standards across 
legal and ethical matters, labor, animal welfare and environmental compliance. We regularly review 
and update the Standards to make sure they are current with emerging issues and expectations. Our 
Standards are available in 42 languages and must be displayed prominently in factory areas where 
workers congregate and in the languages understood by the workers. In FY20, we strengthened our 
Operating Standards to require factories to have formal grievance mechanisms in place. 
All new suppliers must meet our standards before they receive an order from us. If we find a 
supplier in violation of our standards, they must adequately remediate the issue before any 
production orders are placed. We ensure that suppliers maintain compliance with our program of 
auditing, remediation, monitoring, supplier engagement and capability building. 
BETTER LIFE PROGRAMS
In addition to ensuring compliance with our Operating Standards, we are also coordinating with 
factories to improve the overall well-being and career progression of workers through our Better 
Life programs. We aim to make these empowerment and life-skills programs available to 250,000 
workers across our supply chain by 2030. 
EMPOWERING WOMEN 
In FY20, we continued our work with BSR’s (Business for Social Responsibility) HERproject™ in 
Bangladesh sponsoring the HERhealth program. The program provides information on women’s 
health topics such as healthy eating, personal and menstrual hygiene and maternal health. In total, 
the HERproject has benefited about 20,000 workers to date in the supply chain, half of whom 
were women in the HERhealth program. In FY21, we plan to expand the HERhealth program to 
Cambodia. Our aim is for 40,000 workers to benefit from HERhealth by FY23.
Make empowerment and life-skills programs available to 250,000 workers 
across our supply chain 
2030 GOAL
As of FY20, the HERproject has benefited about 20,000 workers to date in the 
supply chain, half of whom were women in the HERhealth program
In FY20, we partnered with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the International 
Labour Organisation (ILO) for their Gender Equality and Returns Program (GEAR), to support the 
achievement of our vision to increase the number of women in leadership positions in our factories 
by 25 percent by 2025.
GEAR tailors its program for women working in garment factories to progress from factory 
workers to supervisors. The program is run by the IFC in partnership with the ILO’s Better Work 
program. They train female workers in the people management and technical skills necessary to 
be promoted to more supervisory roles. They also work with factory management and training 
managers to identify, promote and support high-potential workers.
We launched the GEAR program in selected Bangladesh factories at the end of FY20 and plan to 
roll it out to additional factories in the region throughout FY21.

EXPANDING THE REACH OF BETTER LIFE
Our Better Life programs complement the monitoring, auditing and capability building we 
undertake through our social compliance program. In FY21, we will expand the Better Life 
programs by continuing to:
•	 Promote effective factory grievance mechanisms in all factories through our Operating 
Standards and also confirm a process of escalation that ensures our involvement and 
appropriate follow-up. This RL Grievance Mechanism Program for factory workers was started in 
FY20 and continues to expand factory by factory. 
•	 Work with suppliers to develop transparent human resource systems for wages in their 
factories, and we will undertake several wage studies in our key sourcing regions to deepen our 
understanding of workers’ pay levels and needs. 
In FY20, we created our wage management strategy to focus on developing human resource 
systems with suppliers that will support the opportunity to advance compensation for workers. As 
part of this work, we started in-depth wage analyses and data gathering in key sourcing countries. 
We will continue to engage factory management on the results of this assessment and next steps. 
We look forward to sharing more details about this strategy in coming years.  
FOREIGN MIGRANT WORKER POLICY AND ERADICATING MODERN 
SLAVERY
Migrant and foreign migrant workers can be particularly vulnerable to exploitation and unfair 
employment terms. Because of this, we have a robust Foreign Migrant Worker Policy to secure 
fair employment terms for these groups, no matter which country they have traveled from to 
seek work. 
Our Policy instructs suppliers to minimize the use of recruitment agents. When an agency must be 
used, it is forbidden from charging workers fees to obtain a job. If suppliers are using an agency, 
they must: 
•	 Work with only one agency per country. 
•	 Conduct background checks and due-diligence monitoring. 
•	 Have service agreements with the agency that prohibit discrimination, fees and using subagents. 
The agreement must also grant the supplier the right to audit the agency.
•	 Make grievance mechanisms available to workers during recruitment with the agency.
Our social auditing protocol includes foreign migrant worker interviews to verify compliance with 
our Policy. In FY20, our monitoring identified issues with two factories in Taiwan, where the law 
permits agents to charge workers fees. Our Policy provides protection above the Taiwanese legal 
requirement, and we therefore took action to eliminate this practice at the two factories.
One factory has since stopped producing for us and was removed from our approved finished 
goods factory list. The second factory has changed its practices and is now paying the fees, so the 
workers are not charged. We will monitor compliance going forward and the factory’s continued 
relationship with us will be contingent on full compliance.
We respect universally accepted human rights and assess our supply chain for risks including 
forced labor, human trafficking, deceptive recruiting and child labor. People exploited in these ways 
cannot refuse or cease work because of coercion, threats or deception and may also be deprived 
of personal freedom. 
We have a long history of preventing and, in rare cases, remediating when necessary a wide range 
of issues in our supply chain, including forced labor, child labor and other human rights abuses. We 
strictly prohibit all such practices and have made modern slavery a zero-tolerance issue among 
other zero-tolerance issues discussed on page 38. 
When we evaluate potential new factory partners, we undertake risk assessments as part of our 
social auditing program. If a potential issue is uncovered, that factory will not be approved until the 
issue is satisfactorily remediated. For current partners, if we identify and validate a noncompliance 
with our requirements for eradicating slavery or human trafficking, we will work with that supplier 
to make immediate changes; otherwise we will cease business relations. 
We also fully support the efforts of a growing number of nongovernmental organizations and local and 
national governments to shed light on human trafficking, slavery and child labor in the supply chain.
Roll out our Wage Management Strategy to all of our strategic and key 
suppliers to address fair and timely compensation for factory workers

SOCIAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAM
From the first day a factory starts work for us, our social compliance program seeks to protect 
the rights of workers. We monitor compliance with our Operating Standards through independent 
third-party audits together with audits conducted by our in-house team and assessments from 
Better Work. Our overall monitoring system is shown below. 
Historically, our program has focused on tier 1 suppliers, factories and their direct subcontractors 
that provide us with finished goods. We plan to expand our monitoring of tier 2 suppliers in FY21 
with a focus on key mills and raw material suppliers. We prioritize which facilities to audit based on 
risk assessments, including factors such as business volume, country and the associated supplier 
risk ratings.
ZERO-TOLERANCE ISSUES
Our Operating Standards identify 10 categories of zero-tolerance issues. We will not accept these 
in our supply chain and will de-list factories that do not rectify any instances identified during 
monitoring or through our grievance work.

AUDIT FINDINGS 
Seventy-five percent of factories supplying us were audited in FY20. We conducted a total of 466 
audits between our tier 1 factories and subcontractors. Of these, 392 were at tier 1 factories and 74 
at subcontractors. Independent third parties conducted 333 of the audits, Ralph Lauren conducted 
48 and Better Work 85.
We also screened potential new suppliers with 106 initial on-site evaluations and 65 social audits.
During the year, independent third-party remedial experts started nine long-term capability-
building remediation programs to confirm that corrective action was implemented and to provide 
trainings and support where needed.
The most common categories of nonconformance were health and safety (55.7 percent), legal 
and ethical standards (13.9 percent), wages and benefits (13.7 percent) and working hours 
(10.1 percent). We review all nonconformance issues with the supplier and require that they be 
addressed in a timely manner. Every audit has corrective action plans that are later verified. 
Less than 1 percent of audit findings revealed zero-tolerance issues (34 of 4,501 total findings). Ten 
suppliers were deactivated due to their inability to remediate zero-tolerance or other Operating 
Standards requirements.

A CULTURE OF OWNERSHIP AND IMPROVEMENT  
Our social compliance program builds on the trust established with our suppliers. Our mutual aim 
is for factories to be responsible for managing worker and environmental issues and to embed 
systems for continuous improvement.
We expect to see progressive improvement in standards across our supply chain, implemented 
pro-actively by our suppliers. We create risk segments within our suppliers based on their audit 
results (see chart). This is part of the supplier scoring in our Supplier Engagement program and 
directly influences our sourcing and business decisions. In FY20, there was a reduction in the 
percentage of high risk and unrated factories.

LICENSEES 
In addition to our own products, we license the Ralph Lauren brands to selected companies. 
All licensees are required to have social compliance programs and standards equivalent to our 
own. While these companies are outside the scope of our program, we assess licensee supplier 
compliance programs and review their audits to ensure that they meet our requirements. In FY20, 
32 suppliers used around 346 factories to make licensed products.
CAPABILITY BUILDING
We targeted our capability building training events to help suppliers in regions where there is a 
shared compliance problem. In FY20, we held two summits for suppliers, targeting regional issues.
In Cambodia, The Better Factories program identified a pattern of repeat issues, where remediation 
was often temporary, and the same problem would recur in a subsequent audit. We held a full day 
summit for Cambodia suppliers to explain our social compliance and Operating Standards in detail 
and discuss strategies for improving and maintaining compliance at factories. We encouraged 
them to lower their rating by one full category within a year—factories failing to achieve this will be 
required to participate in additional remediation and capability training.
In Italy, we identified a potential risk of unauthorized subcontracting and the associated risk of forced 
labor among their immigrant workers. We immediately held a supplier summit to bring awareness 
and address the issue. We are currently working on an enhanced supplier mapping and verification 
process to ensure that there are no unauthorized facilities in our supply chain. This will ensure our 
presence in all of our subcontractor facilities and ability to monitor them on a regular basis.

CAPACITY ASSESSMENT 
Achieving consistent working hours within acceptable limits remains a top issue in our industry. 
Excessive working hours have many causes, and we acknowledge that apparel brands like ours can 
be part of the problem but also part of the solution. 
If we place orders at short notice with a factory, we can exceed its capacity to supply us on time. 
As a consequence, the factory might subcontract the work without our authorization—which we 
do not allow—or impose longer hours on its workers to fulfill our orders. To avoid this, we plan 
our orders early, providing enough time to review the capacities and capabilities that exist in our 
supply chain, as well as anticipate new capabilities that might be needed for upcoming seasons. 
We then confirm available capacities ensuring that product orders are allocated to the right 
manufacturing partners that possess the adequate time and skills.
To further our capacity assessments, we established an internal Manufacturing Excellence team 
that works closely with factories in implementing the best production control processes and quality 
systems, ultimately improving their efficiency and productivity. 
 
We also use local teams, which are trained with Ralph Lauren quality standards, to ensure that no 
unauthorized subcontracting is used. When they recognize signs of overload they will partner with 
the capacity and merchandising teams to overcome the existing bottleneck and mitigate potential 
future problems.
We conduct quarterly capacity reviews that take into account our suppliers’ social compliance 
scores, capacity, quality metrics and outstanding orders. Our sourcing team confirms supplier 
capacity to fulfill our orders by reviewing order placements on a weekly basis to ensure that 
commitments given to suppliers ahead of time are adhered to.

Significant changes to the organization and its 
supply chain
During FY20, we expanded our global distribution with 25 net new stores and concessions globally (five in North America, six in 
Europe and 14 in Asia). We also consolidated our North America corporate facilities to scale back our footprint. 
In response to trade developments between the U.S. and China, we took steps in FY20 to mitigate our exposure to the resulting 
tariffs, including diverting production to and sourcing from other countries, among other actions. In FY20, approximately 25 
percent of our products (by dollar value) were sourced from China, down from approximately one-third the year before.

Governance structure 
As a public company, RLC is governed by a Board of Directors. The Board has four committees, consisting of only independent 
directors. The committees are the Audit Committee, the Nominating, Governance, Citizenship and Sustainability Committee 
(the Nominating Committee), the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee and the Finance Committee. 
The Nominating Committee has oversight of companywide environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies and initiatives. 
The Audit Committee oversees the enterprise risk management process, including ESG risk. The Finance Committee joins the 
Nominating Committee in advising on incorporating sustainability goals into our corporate strategy and engagement on strategy 
initiatives influencing sustainability and corporate citizenship. See the Global Citizenship & Sustainability Governance section on 
page 6 of our 2020 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report.

Identifying and selecting stakeholders 
We work with a number of NGOs and multi-stakeholder initiatives, identifying partners that share our values and long-term 
goals and that bring expertise and complementary skill sets to our strategies and initiatives. See the Materiality and Stakeholder 
Engagement section on page 6 of our 2020 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report.
102-43
Approach to stakeholder engagement
We engage with our stakeholders at varying frequencies and in different formats to inform our citizenship and sustainability strategy. 
In FY19, we conducted a materiality assessment to help identify and prioritize the sustainability issues, risks and opportunities that 
matter most to our business and stakeholders. The assessment was conducted by a third party and included extensive engagement 
with internal and external stakeholders including employees, selected licensees, suppliers, partners, NGOs and consumers. Based on 
this assessment, we set goals for each of our priority material issues and selected issues in other categories which are shared in our 
2020 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report. 
To reach our companywide goals, we frequently engage external stakeholders with expertise in our focus areas. In our 2020 Global 
Citizenship & Sustainability Report we summarize our work with external stakeholders that took place in FY20. As examples, in FY20 
we worked with the Better Cotton Initiative and the Textile Exchange to increase our sourcing of sustainable cotton, with ZDHC to 
implement their MRSL list with our suppliers, and with the IFC and ILO to implement their Gender Equality and Returns (GEAR) 
program at factories that produce our products. 
We also communicate regularly with investors on ESG issues, typically either through the regular course of investor meetings or one-
off meeting requests. 
Our executive leaders are among the internal stakeholders engaged in our citizenship and sustainability program. Our Nominating 
Committee oversees our ESG risks and opportunities. The Nominating Committee receives quarterly updates, reviews initiatives, 
goals and policies, and makes recommendations to the Board on ESG matters. The full Board receives a report on citizenship and 
sustainability progress at least once annually. 
We invite the public to provide feedback on our sustainability program through GlobalCorporateCommunications@RalphLauren.com.

Reduction of energy consumption 
Energy savings from conservation and efficiency initiatives cannot currently be calculated. FY20 is the baseline assessment of our 
complete energy consumption. Our previous energy assessment did not account for all of our facilities and energy use, and our 
accounting system did not allow for easy recalculation of previous years. We anticipate reporting energy savings in future years 
measured against our FY20 baseline.
In FY20, we continued to deploy conservation and efficiency initiatives that will demonstrate energy savings in future years. In 
FY20, we opened 11 stores globally designed with LED lighting and we retrofitted the lighting in 16 stores to be more energy 
efficient. In FY21, we will retrofit the lighting at the remainder of our Polo and Ralph Lauren-branded stores in North America and 
we are evaluating additional opportunities at our Asian and European stores.

baseline. In FY20, we formed a partnership with the World Wildlife Fund to accelerate progress toward our goal. In this first year of 
the partnership, we are analyzing our water footprint, identifying areas of water risk, and outlining strategies to decrease our water 
consumption while also identifying opportunities to address water quality and access needs across our value chain.

are unable to share comparative historical data for FY18 and FY19. Our previous footprint did not account for all of our facilities and 
energy use, and our carbon accounting system did not allow for easy recalculation of previous years. Therefore, we decided to use FY20 
as our baseline to ensure accuracy and full inclusion of all emissions sources. 
Emission factor sources: eGrid, Green-e, IEA, AIB and EPA. GWP source:  IPCC Assessment Report 5, 100-year GWP (AR5).
Consolidation approach: Operational control
Standards, methodologies, assumptions and calculation tools used: World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Emissions 
calculated for refrigerants and energy from natural gas, diesel, propane, gas oil and heavy fuel oil consumed at global owned and 
operated retail stores, offices and distribution centers. Site-specific energy use is determined using a three-tiered system, depending on 
the availability of primary data for the fiscal year. If we have primary data for all months that a facility was operating in the fiscal year, the 
energy usage data is simply summed. If we have partial primary data, a regression is attempted based on typical yearly weather data to 
fill gaps. Finally, if the regression fails or we have no primary data, we model yearly energy using facility square footage and an energy 
use intensity based on the climate zone and facility type.

MANAGEMENT OF CHEMICALS IN PRODUCTS
Discussion of processes to maintain
compliance with restricted substances
regulations
CG-AA-250a.1
Ralph Lauren tests to the strictest global standard. Tests are performed through our Apparel Testing Program, which ensures our products 
meet compliance requirements. The program also contains protocols on how tests should be conducted, including processes for fabric testing, 
component testing and finished-goods testing.
We use independent third-party labs that are accredited and certified for all testing. They conduct raw material risk assessments of our lines 
each year to ensure that we will be able to meet our compliance requirements.
Our three stages of testing are:
1. Fabric testing for apparel
2. Component testing for apparel, footwear and accessories
3. Finished-goods testing for home, apparel and footwear.
We also have Vendor Compliance Packets (VCPs) for all mills and finished-goods suppliers. The VCPs state suppliers must abide by all laws and
compliance issues and therefore provide us with products in compliance with regulations.
We adhere to the AAFA restricted substances list, which includes REACH.
Discussion of processes to assess and manage
risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals
in products
CG-AA-250a.2
Our process for assessing and managing risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products is described above. Policy and practices are 
the same across our brands and product categories. As described above, all products undergo testing to confirm compliance with regulations. 
Depending on the volume of orders, some styles may undergo more testing than others. We take a combination of hazard-based and risk-based 
approaches to chemical management. As mentioned above, we complete extensive risk assessments each year by raw material. We are fully 
compliant with all laws and regulations and are currently exploring innovations for reduction, elimination or assessment outside of that scope. 
The third-party certifications used and our approach to chemical management at each stage of the product lifecycle are discussed above.
RLC has established partnership with the ZDHC to join the industry’s collective in eliminating the usage and discharge of hazardous chemical 
substances, as well as promoting the development and adoption of safer alternatives. We have adopted the ZDHC manufacturing restricted 
substances list (MRSL) and have started to communicate our expectations to our supply chain. Our first phase rollout of the chemical 
management program is targeted at our key and strategic suppliers, as well as our top raw materials suppliers. The suppliers are expected 
to adopt the chemical inventory list (CIL) management tool and provide visibility to the chemicals used in production through the tool. The 
chemical inventory will be screened against the ZDHC MRSL to monitor conformance and push for the adoption of safer alternatives. In 
conjunction with these collaborative efforts, we are also developing a chemical phaseout program internally as to proactively eliminate the use 
of the priority chemicals in future design and production.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN
Percentage of (1) tier 1 supplier facilities
and (2) supplier facilities beyond tier 1 in
compliance with wastewater discharge 
permits and/or contractual agreement
CG-AA-430a.1
We explicitly state in our Vendor Compliance and Operating Standards that all suppliers are required to adhere to all applicable laws and 
regulations of the regions where they operate, including but not limited to the local environmental standards. We have the right to terminate our 
business relationship should the supplier fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations.
Our main supply chain risks associated with the wastewater discharge are related to the usage of chemicals in production and the effluent 
treatment system put in place. 
Our supplier facilities implement effluent treatment methods in accordance with the local regulatory requirements. This may include operating 
an on-site effluent treatment plant (ETP), partnering with an off-site ETP, and for some, implementing a zero liquid discharge (ZLD) effluent 
treatment system. 
We have adopted the ZDHC manufacturing restricted substances list (MRSL) and its suite of tools to guide and align our efforts to eliminate 
the use and discharge of hazardous chemicals with the industry’s standards and best practices. This includes the implementation of ZDHC 
Wastewater Guidelines, which provides guidance in effluent testing methods, parameters, limits and reporting approach, as a way to confirm that 
our production facility is not discharging hazardous chemicals to the environment. We are rolling out the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines to our 
strategic and key suppliers in 2020 as part of our sustainable chemicals management program to monitor the facilities’ conformance with the 
ZDHC MRSL. While the wastewater test is only a snapshot of the effluent quality of the facility, it ensures an annual monitoring that allows us to 
follow up and address any nonconformance from the source through root cause analysis and helps inform both the facility and us on targeted 
chemicals phaseout. 
Percentage of (1) tier 1 supplier facilities and
(2) supplier facilities beyond tier 1 that have

RAW MATERIALS SOURCING
Description of environmental and social risks
associated with sourcing priority raw materials
CG-AA-440a.1
We currently identify our priority raw materials as those that make up the majority of our total material use by unit of products. Our raw 
materials assessment includes apparel and other Ralph Lauren products including home goods, footwear and accessories. Our key materials 
include cotton, wool, cashmere, leather, viscose, polyester, down. 
The environmental risks associated with sourcing these raw materials include the potential harmful effects of chemical and water use. The primary 
social risk is that the farms and factories we source from may have poor working conditions that negatively affect the people working there.
To manage our risk associated with priority raw materials, we set a 2025 goal for 100 percent of our key materials to be sustainably sourced. 
We also set a goal for 100 percent of our animal-derived materials—as covered by our animal welfare policy—to be certified or traceable. We 
define sustainably sourced with specific standards and certifications for each raw material we have set goals for: cotton, wool, cashmere,
