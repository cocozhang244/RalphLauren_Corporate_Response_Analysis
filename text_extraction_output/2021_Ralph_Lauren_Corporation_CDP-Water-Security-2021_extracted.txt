Ralph Lauren Corporation - Water Security 2021
W0. Introduction
W0.1
(W0.1) Give a general description of and introduction to your organization.
Founded in 1967 by Mr. Ralph Lauren, we are a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear,
accessories, home furnishings, fragrances, and hospitality. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across an expanding number of products,
brands, sales channels, and international markets. We believe that our global reach, breadth of product offerings, and multi-channel distribution are unique among luxury and
apparel companies.
Our global reach is extensive, as we sell directly to customers throughout the world via our 548 retail stores and 650 concession-based shop-within-shops, as well as through
our own digital commerce sites and those of various third-party digital partners. Merchandise is also available through our wholesale distribution channels at approximately
9,000 doors worldwide, the majority in specialty stores, as well as through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers. In addition to our directly-operated
stores and shops, our international licensing partners operate 139 Ralph Lauren stores and shops, and 143 Club Monaco stores and shops.
For more than 50 years, Ralph Lauren has inspired the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style, and we approach Citizenship & Sustainability with this in
mind. This core purpose informs our every day at Ralph Lauren and extends across our entire business. It is inextricably linked to how we create a better future for our
Company, the people we come into contact with and the world.
Two years ago, we launched our renewed Citizenship & Sustainability strategy, Design the Change. Our strategy was built on the values and purpose that have defined our
business for more than half a century, and it is based on our belief that together with our industry, we can deliver the change required to create a positive impact in society and
a more sustainable future. 
When we set out on our journey to Design the Change, we set ambitious goals and dedicated ourselves to integrating our strategy into every part of our business with a clear
focus on three pillars: Creating Timeless Style, Protecting the Environment, and Championing Better Lives.
Design the Change accelerates our work across Global Citizenship & Sustainability. Fundamentally, we believe that together with our industry, we can deliver the change
required to create a positive impact in society and a more sustainable future. 
Through Design the Change, we:
· Create Timeless Style: We believe one of our greatest commitments to sustainability is designing products worn, loved and made to last. We are committed to responsible
sourcing and using state-of-the-art materials that allow us to create our products more sustainably, without compromising the quality we’re known for.
· Protect the Environment: We’re using partnerships and technology to reduce the environmental impact of our operations and supply chain across energy, emissions, water
and waste. We believe collaboration is key to finding solutions, which is why we joined leading groups and support nonprofits dedicated to mitigating the environmental
impacts of business.
· Champion Better Lives: We aim to positively affect the lives of those touched by our business, including people in our communities, workforce and supply chain.
Risks and opportunities described herein with the potential to have a ‘substantive financial or strategic impact on our business’ are not necessarily ‘material’ to investors as
defined by the SEC.

Direct use (current):
We identified the water availability in our direct operations as ‘not very important’ given that use of freshwater in Ralph Lauren’s owned and operated facilities is only related to
domestic purposes that do not represent high water intensity.
Indirect use (current):The use of freshwater in our indirect operations is mainly associated with our raw material (e.g., cotton growing) and manufacturing processes (e.g., fabric
and garment dyeing and washing).
Future: Our approach to water stewardship includes actions that address overall use and quality, as well as protecting watersheds and ensuring access. We partner with the
World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to advance our work in this area and set a comprehensive strategy for water stewardship and water use reductions in our value chain. We
analyzed our value chain through the WWF Water Risk Filter to map key areas of water risk and develop a water footprint. The analysis also identified opportunities for
watershed conservation, reduced water consumption and improved community access to water. Our goal to reduce water use by at least 20 percent by 2025 relates to
manufacturing and processing in our supply chain and water use in our owned and operated facilities, compared to a FY20 baseline. In our direct operations, we will seek
opportunities to decrease water use intensity in landscaping at our distribution centers and through application of low-flow fixtures in our distribution centers, offices, and
stores. In our manufacturing supply chain, we focus on improving water use efficiency while also considering the shared basin-level water needs where our suppliers’ fabric
mills, factories, and laundries are located. We take a contextual water target approach to better align our reduction goal with surrounding water challenges. In priority water-
stressed locations, we are contributing to collective action projects with WWF, local partners and experts to scale water use assessments and reduction strategies.

Address current and future use
We identified the water availability in our direct operations as ‘not very important’ given the use of water in Ralph Lauren’s own and operated facilities is only related to
domestic purposes that do not represent high water intensity. The use of recycled water in our business operations is largely dependent upon the availability and adoption of
water recycling technology in the leased, multi-tenant buildings that we largely occupy.
Indirect use: 
Our manufacturing supply chain uses recycled and process water in the production processes (i.e., dyeing and washing to decrease dependency on freshwater resources
and costs). Due to the limited scale and application, the usage of recycled and process water is currently not high, as compared to freshwater. There are geographies where
our products and materials are manufactured that have regulations related to the Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) or the use of recycled water. As such, the availability of water
resources and our manufacturers’ ability to recycle and reuse process water is therefore identified as an important factor in our indirect use. 
Future: 
The use of recycled and process water in our owned and operated facilities is likely to remain constant. However, our use of recycled and process water could increase if
there are improvements in the availability and adoption of water recycling technology in the leased, multi-tenant buildings that we largely occupy. We also foresee the more
urgent need to promote water recycling in our manufacturing supply chain. As water recycling technologies mature in our sourcing regions, it has the potential to become a
common practice in the manufacturing facilities globally, and thus help reduce our manufacturing dependency on freshwater resources.

Based on the CDP guidance, this question only considers the number of Ralph Lauren’s directly owned and operated facilities that are exposed to the water risks in our supply
chain. As we identified inherent water-related risks within our value chain beyond our operations, we put in place mitigation efforts that focus on building our supply chain resilience
to water-related risks. More information is provided in W4.3a. The impact of water risks in our supply chain to our directly owned and operated facilities is therefore deemed not
significant, as reported in W1.1. Hence, we do not report on W3.1C for the same reason.

Our main driver for investing in initiatives related to water efficiency improvements is to minimize our impact and reliance on freshwater resources. These initiatives may
have the potential of significant cost savings and help minimize the risk of financial loss due to water-related issues for manufacturers that implement the efficiency
measures. This enhances the business value and market competitiveness for our manufacturers, especially those with high water intensity, and are located in regions with
high water scarcity risks.

help reduce our supply chain’s reliance on freshwater resources, hence increasing our supply chain resilience, considering some of our manufacturing facilities are located
in regions with high water scarcity risk. For raw materials, we evaluated the impacts of cotton farming as part of our water stewardship strategy. Cotton accounts for more
than 80 percent of our total material use. We looked at our key cotton growing regions through the WWF Water Risk Filter to identify geographies with high risk for water
scarcity. We also estimated total water use (rainfed and irrigated) in cotton agriculture—the volume used is significant and our focus is on both reducing water use in cotton
production and increasing effectiveness of water use. A key driver of this is the adoption of regenerative farming practices that make better use of rainfall and irrigated land.
These practices increase soil fertility, water holding capacity and carbon capture; reduce erosion and pollution runoff; and create more resilience against floods and
droughts.

Company-specific description & strategy to realize opportunity
Ralph Lauren is committed to industry partnerships and investing in scalable, innovative technologies that enable further efficiencies in processes, material usage, water,
and energy consumption. These initiatives help unlock opportunities in our value chain to reduce reliance in freshwater resources. This year we announced Color on
Demand, a multi-phased system with a clear ambition to deliver the world’s first scalable zero wastewater cotton dyeing system. As part of the first phase of Color on
Demand, Ralph Lauren optimized the use of ECOFAST™ Pure Sustainable Textile Treatment, a pre-treatment solution developed by Dow for cotton textiles. When used
with existing dyeing equipment, ECOFAST™ Pure enables the use of up to 40% less water, 85% fewer chemicals, 90% less energy and a 60% reduction in carbon
footprint compared to traditional cotton dyeing processes. We are integrating and scaling this innovative technique in our supply chain and will launch products using this
technology later in 2021. By 2025, we aim to use the Color on Demand platform in more than 80% of our solid cotton products, leading to cost savings and water use
reductions in upstream production. Ralph Lauren is also working toward more sustainable denim with an innovative processing technique to reduce the use of water-
intensity chemicals and phase out the use of potassium permanganate in denim wash.

Ralph Lauren takes a holistic approach to water stewardship, covering our value chain and beyond. We are committed to reducing water consumption across our value chain
and to safeguarding and preserving water resources in our communities. Our water sustainability strategy is aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement, the UN Global Compact
and SDG6. Our goal is to achieve at least a 20% reduction in total water use across our operations and value chain by 2025. We collaborate with the World Wildlife Fund
(WWF) to advance our work in this area and set a comprehensive strategy for water stewardship and water use reductions in our value chain. We are taking a contextual water
target approach to better align our reduction goals with the water challenges in our value chain. In priority water-stressed locations, we are contributing to collective action
programs with WWF, local partners, and experts to scale water use assessments and reduction strategies. We are also working to eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals in
our production by 2025. We monitor our suppliers’ conformance to the ZDHC MRSL and require our suppliers to conduct wastewater tests aligned with ZDHC Wastewater
Guidelines to ensure no hazardous chemical is discharged through wastewater. We are also committed to developing water-related innovation through the Color on Demand
technology platform, which optimizes the use of ECOFAST™ Pure-a pre-treatment solution for cotton garments, developed by Dow. When used with existing dyeing equipment,
ECOFAST™ Pure enables the use of up to 40 percent less water compared to traditional cotton dyeing processes. Our water stewardship strategy also supports watershed
health through conservation interventions, including wetland restoration, stakeholder engagement, and the adoption of preferable land use management practices. We are
investing in a number of water conservation programs in the coming year, as well as furthering our partnerships with organizations focused on community access and WASH
(Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) solutions, based on local needs. Through our continued partnership with GiveMeTap, we provide funding to water projects to provide drinking
water and install water pumps for the areas in need. In FY21, the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation expanded its partnership with DigDeep, a nonprofit focused on increasing
access to water and sanitation throughout the U.S.

Ralph Lauren’s Global Citizenship & Sustainability governance is integrated across all levels of our organization. Our Board of Directors (the Board) is responsible for formal
governance of Global Citizenship & Sustainability. The Nominating, Governance, Citizenship and Sustainability Committee of the Board oversees our environmental, social and
governance (ESG) risks and opportunities; receives quarterly updates; reviews initiatives, goals, and policies; and makes recommendations to the Board on ESG matters. We
regularly conduct materiality assessments to help identify and prioritize the citizenship and sustainability issues, risks, and opportunities that matter most to our business and
stakeholders. Within our governance structure, we have created the Water Stewardship Working Group, dedicated to driving our water stewardship commitment and KPIs. This
working group reports to our company-wide Global Citizenship & Sustainability Steering Committee. 
In terms of long-term business objectives, we have set our water-related commitment across our raw material sourcing, supply chain, and direct operations. Our goal is to achieve
at least a 20 percent reduction in total water use across our operations and value chain compared to a FY20 baseline by 2025. In our strategic business growth plan, we fully
integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business principles and use sustainability KPIs as one of the metrics for measuring the success of our long-term business
objectives.

Building resilience across our value chain is critical for our long-term business objectives. We set medium- to long-term goals for climate and water, which we believe align our
trajectory towards our long-term objectives. We use the WWF Water Risk Filter to identify our water risks. We are taking the contextual water target approach, and investing in
collective action projects with WWF and local partners to scale water conservation efforts. We monitor our supply chain water performance through the Higg FEM and collaborate
with the Apparel Impact Institute (Aii) to identify opportunities for efﬁciency with regard to energy, chemical, and water use. We also adopted the ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted
Substances List (MRSL), and collaborate with industry to eliminate the use and discharge of hazardous chemicals across the apparel supply chain. Our raw material water strategy
includes accelerating the adoption of regenerative cotton farming practices, and working towards achieving 100% sustainably sourced cotton by 2025. We are also committed to
investing in scalable, innovative technologies that enable further efficiencies in processes, materials, water, and energy consumption. These innovative technologies help unlock
opportunities in our value chain to reduce reliance in freshwater resources. This year we announced Color on Demand, a multi-phased system with a clear ambition to deliver the
world’s first scalable zero wastewater cotton dyeing system.

The Finance and the Nominating, Governance & Sustainability Committees of our Board of Directors advise on the incorporation of goals into our corporate strategy and business
initiatives that influence corporate citizenship and sustainability. As part of our financial planning, we have a portion of our budget dedicated to water-related programs. We
financed and collaborated with Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), WWF Water Risk Filter, Apparel Impact Institute (Aii), and organizations that focused on watershed health and
community WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) solutions. As a Better Cotton Initiative member, we support its mission to address the environmental, social, and economic
issues associated with growing cotton. Through our work with WWF, we helped to create healthier eco-systems and addressed issues at basin-level. In partnership with Aii, our
suppliers identified the opportunities to reduce energy, chemical, and water use. We are investing in a number of water conservation programs in the coming year, as well as
furthering our partnerships with organizations focused on community access and WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) solutions based on local needs.

Ralph Lauren’s Global Citizenship & Sustainability governance, targets, and goals are integrated across all levels of our organization. We regularly conduct materiality assessments to
help identify and prioritize the citizenship and sustainability issues, risks, and opportunities that matter most to our business and stakeholders. 
We commit to reducing water consumption across our value chain and to safeguarding and preserving water resources in our communities. To achieve this commitment, our water
stewardship strategy consists of 3 pillars: 1) CONSERVATION - Safeguard and preserve water resources where we operate through contextual water targets and collective action
program implementation in priority geographies with high water stress. 2) COTTON - Sustainably-source cotton and accelerate the adoption of regenerative farming practices. 3)
COMMUNITY - Partner with organizations focused on watershed health and community WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) solutions. In addition to our water stewardship
strategy, we also commit to aim to eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals in our supply chain as part of our sustainable chemicals management work to minimize the impact of
water and environmental pollution in our manufacturing geographies. Each of the commitments is incorporated across our business operations through each relevant department’s
goals and KPIs, and tracked on a quarterly basis at minimum.
Under our governance structure, we have created a cross-functional Water Stewardship Working Group, dedicated to driving our water stewardship commitment and KPIs. They
provide a progress report to our Global Citizenship & Sustainability Senior Steering Committee on a quarterly basis. Our Global Citizenship & Sustainability Senior Steering Committee
is chaired by our Chief Product and Sustainability Officer and includes leaders from across the Company. The Steering Committee meets monthly to review progress, prioritize our
approach, and allocate resources. Our Nominating, Governance & Sustainability committee of our Board of Directors has oversight of companywide environmental, social, and
governance (ESG) policies and initiatives. The committee receives quarterly updates; reviews initiatives, goals, and policies; and makes recommendations to the Board on ESG
matters. Our Board of Directors (the Board) is responsible for formal governance of Global Citizenship & Sustainability. The full Board receives a report on citizenship and
sustainability progress at least once annually, including water-related issues, and reviews the Company’s annual Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report.

We are taking a contextual water target approach to better align our reduction goal with surrounding water challenges. In priority water-stressed locations, we are
contributing to collective action projects with WWF and local partnerships and experts to scale water use assessments and reduction strategies. By 2025, we aim to use the
Color on Demand platform in more than 80% of our solid cotton products. We remain committed to implementing our water stewardship action plan for achieving and
maintaining a 20 percent reduction in our water footprint (manufacturing and processing in our supply chain and water use in our owned and operated facilities) by 2025. In
FY21, our footprint was 9,661,765 m3 — a 34 percent reduction compared to FY20 baseline of 14,870,315 m3. This decrease was primarily driven by COVID-19-related
business impacts, such as production volumes decreasing by over 30 percent compared to FY20, which contributes significantly to our supply chain water consumption.

Cotton accounts for more than 80 percent of our total material use. We are committed to sourcing cotton in a manner that prioritizes soil health, utilizes water efficiently,
minimizes chemical inputs, and supports workers’ rights and farmers’ profitability, while reducing our product water intensity. Aligned with our FY21 goal, we continue to
transition core products such as polo shirts, knits, chinos, and shirts to sustainably sourced cotton. In the future, we aim to adopt regenerative farming practices that make
better use of rainfall and irrigated land. These practices increase soil fertility, water holding capacity, and carbon capture; reduce erosion and pollution runoff; and create
more resilience against floods and droughts.

Through our partnership with the ZDHC Programme, we collaborate with peers and experts to aim to eliminate the use and discharge of hazardous chemicals across our
textile and leather supply chain. We require our manufacturers’ facilities with wet processing to provide us with transparency on their chemical usage and MRSL
compliance on monthly basis, and to test their wastewater against ZDHC wastewater guidelines and share the results with us through the ZDHC Gateway portal on an
annual basis at minimum. This helps us monitor our suppliers’ wastewater discharge quality and address issues in a timely manner in order to achieve our goal of
eliminating the use of hazardous chemicals in our supply chain by 2025.

We monitor our progress through the number of initiatives and outreach in our WASH partnerships and solutions. Through our continued partnership with GiveMeTap in
FY21, we helped fund drinking water projects in rural Africa. We also donate at least $2
for every Polo-branded bottle sold on RalphLauren.com to help fund the installation of water pumps across rural Ghana. To date, the program has provided 18 water pumps
in the Upper West region of Ghana and benefited more than 18,000 people. In FY21, the Foundation expanded its partnership with DigDeep, a non-profit focused on
increasing access to water and sanitation throughout the U.S. Our three-year collaboration will support the COVID-19 emergency water delivery program for Navajo
families, helping to ensure safe water access for 1,500 households and to provide 11 families with in-home water systems in 2022.
