restrictions, such as those imposed by the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act ("UFLPA") or the Countering America's Adversaries Through

shipping delays, inventory shortages, and/or higher freight costs resulting from port strikes, the recent Red Sea crisis, and/or disruptions to major
waterways such as the Suez and Panama canals;

PART I
Item 1.    Business.
General
Founded in 1967 by Mr. Ralph Lauren, we are a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of luxury lifestyle products, including apparel,
footwear & accessories, home, fragrances, and hospitality. For nearly 60 years, Ralph Lauren has sought to inspire the dream of a better life through
authenticity and timeless style. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products, brands, distribution
channels, and international markets. We believe that our global reach, breadth of lifestyle product offerings, and multi-channel distribution network are unique
among luxury and apparel companies.
We diversify our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and
licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or
channel of distribution. We sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-
shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-
party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which we have licensed the right to operate in defined geographic
territories using our trademarks. In addition, we license to third parties for specified
3


================================================================================
[PAGE 6 OF 144]
================================================================================
periods the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel
categories, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.
We organize our business into the following three reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to these reportable segments, we
also have other non-reportable segments. See "Our Segments" for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.
Our global reach is extensive, as we sell directly to customers throughout the world via our 564 retail stores and 671 concession-based shop-within-
shops, as well as through our own digital commerce sites and those of various third-party digital partners. Merchandise is also available through our
wholesale distribution channels at over 9,400 doors worldwide, the majority in specialty stores, as well as through the digital commerce sites of many of our
wholesale customers. In addition to our directly-operated stores and shops, our international licensing partners operate 116 stores.
We have been controlled by the Lauren family since the founding of our Company. As of March 29, 2025, Mr. R. Lauren, or entities controlled by the
Lauren family, held approximately 85% of the voting power of the Company's outstanding common stock.
Objectives and Opportunities
Our purpose is to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. We believe that our size and the global scope of our
operations provide us with design, sourcing, and distribution synergies across our business. Our core strengths include a portfolio of luxury lifestyle products
spanning across five categories: apparel, footwear & accessories, home, fragrances, and hospitality; a well-diversified global multi-channel distribution
network; an investment philosophy supported by a strong balance sheet; and an experienced management team. Despite the various risks and uncertainties
associated with the current global economic environment, as discussed further in Item 7 — "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Global Economic Conditions and Industry Trends," we believe our core strengths will allow us to effectively execute our long-
term growth strategy.
During our September 2022 Investor Day, we introduced our current 3-year long-term growth strategy for Fiscal 2023 to Fiscal 2025, which is
presented below:
Our next Investor Day will be held in September 2025, during which we will present our latest long-term growth strategy.

================================================================================
Global Citizenship and Sustainability
At Ralph Lauren, our purpose to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style guides everything we do. From creating iconic
products to be worn, loved, and passed on through generations, to preserving the world's natural resources and supporting the people and communities that
intersect our business, we continue to challenge ourselves when it comes to positively impacting our world. That is what we call Timeless by Design, our
approach to Global Citizenship and Sustainability and our ambition for a better future. We weave our Company's purpose throughout our business through
three key pillars:
1.
Create with Intent
•
Integrated Circularity — Our ethos of timelessness has always guided our creative vision. Today, we continue to deepen this philosophy and are
evolving the way our products are designed, made, used, and recirculated. From empowering our designers with circular principles, to using
materials that are sustainably sourced or recycled, our approach is designed to lessen our environmental impact.
•
Sustainable Materials — Our iconic products are designed to be timeless and intended to be worn for generations. With this in mind, we choose
our materials thoughtfully to ensure high-quality and durability. We are committed to using materials in ways that not only help our products
live on, but also to help reduce environmental impact, protect biodiversity and animal welfare, support livelihoods, and improve the traceability
of raw materials.
•
Design with Intent — Since our founding, Ralph Lauren has been inspired by the beautiful and interconnected histories, arts, crafts, and cultures
that make up the fabric of America. We are on a journey to evolve from inspiration to collaboration with communities that inspire us, which
includes taking meaningful steps to be more inclusive throughout our business, from how we design to how products go to market. At its core,
our Design with Intent function is about making sure the products we create and the stories we tell are authentic expressions of heritage, which
is foundational to our timeless brand.
•
Value Chain for Impact — To build a resilient and responsible supply chain, we are continuing to increase the transparency and traceability of
our full value chain, strengthen our relationships with suppliers, and identify areas for improvement. We work with our suppliers to respect
human rights and promote environmental sustainability.
2.
Protect the Environment
•
Climate — Significant reductions to global greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions are collectively needed so we can protect and preserve the
natural resources on which we depend. That is why we have committed to near-term and long-term targets to reduce absolute GHG emissions
across our operations and supply chain.
•
Water Stewardship — We are committed to reducing water consumption across our value chain, as it is critical for communities and ecosystems
to thrive and is also an essential resource for our business. We strive to conserve water throughout our operations, support our suppliers to
improve their water use efficiency and responsibly manage wastewater, and help improve community access to this resource.
•
Waste Management — We are committed to conserving natural resources by managing waste responsibly. We work to minimize waste in our
operations and divert waste from landfills and incineration through donation, reuse, and recycling. Our goal is continued improvement as we
incorporate "zero waste" principles throughout our business practices.
•
Chemical Management — We are committed to monitoring and reducing hazardous chemical use and discharge from our supply chain.
•
Biodiversity — Our business depends on critical resources such as freshwater and essential raw materials, and climate change and biodiversity
loss are closely intertwined. As ecosystems are increasingly threatened, we are committed to leveraging science to build an in-depth
understanding of our current impacts on biodiversity.
5


================================================================================
[PAGE 8 OF 144]
================================================================================
3.
Champion Better Lives
•
Belonging & Equity — We believe a diversity of backgrounds, skills, and experiences of our employees and our culture of inclusivity drive
innovation and creativity. We are committed to further strengthening a sense of belonging and equal opportunities for all. Our strategy is guided
by three focus areas — Talent, Engagement, and Learning — and is designed to create a culture of belonging, enable open dialogue, amplify all
perspectives, and continue to grow and advance our best-in-class talent.
•
Employee Well-being — Our people drive our success and we are dedicated to supporting the physical, emotional, social, and financial needs of
our employees and their families to help them thrive. To do so, we are focused on employee wellness, engagement, learning and development,
and compensation and benefits.
•
Community Engagement and Philanthropy — We seek to make the dream of a better life a reality in communities across the globe through
contributions and actions that create positive social and environmental impact. The two main drivers of our giving efforts are through the
Company's Social and Community Impact department and donations to The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation.
•
Rights and Empowerment in the Supply Chain — We are committed to conducting our global operations ethically with respect for the dignity of
all people who make our products. To support this, we work with our suppliers to build capacity, with workers to empower them, and with
industry partners to collaborate for positive change. Our comprehensive approach integrates risk assessment, monitoring, remediation, capability
building, stakeholder engagement, life skills programs and empowerment opportunities for factory workers.
Our most recently published Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report covering Fiscal 2024 may be found on our corporate website at
https://corporate.ralphlauren.com/citizenship-and-sustainability. Our Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report covering Fiscal 2025 is expected to be
released in September 2025. The content of our sustainability reports is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other
report or document we file with the SEC. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Citizenship and Sustainability Issues."
Recent Developments
Next Generation Transformation Project
We are in the early stages of executing a large-scale multi-year global project that is expected to significantly transform the way in which we operate
our business and further enable our long-term strategic pivot towards a global direct-to-consumer-oriented model (the "Next Generation Transformation
project" or "NGT project"). The NGT project will be completed in phases and involves the redesigning of certain end-to-end processes and the
implementation of a suite of technology systems on a global scale. Such efforts are expected to result in significant process improvements and the creation of
synergies across core areas of operations, including merchandise buying and planning, procurement, inventory management, retail and wholesale operations,
and financial planning and reporting, better enabling us to optimize inventory levels and increase the speed with which we react to changes in consumer
demand across markets, among other benefits.
In connection with the preliminary phase of the NGT project, we incurred other charges of $25.2 million and $5.1 million during Fiscal 2025 and
Fiscal 2024, respectively, which were recorded within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
Our Brands and Products
Our products, which include apparel and footwear & accessories for men, women, and children, as well as our fragrance and home collections, together
with our hospitality portfolio, comprise one of the most widely recognized families of consumer brands. Reflecting a distinctive American perspective, we

Directly-Operated Digital Commerce Websites
In addition to our stores, our retail business sells products online in North America, Europe, and Asia through our various directly-operated digital
commerce sites, which include www.RalphLauren.com, among others. We continue to expand accessibility to our digital flagships globally while localizing
language, currencies, payment methods, product assortments, and content. We also sell our products online through various third-party digital partner
commerce sites, primarily in Asia, as well as through our Ralph Lauren app in the U.S.
Our Ralph Lauren digital commerce sites offer our customers access to a broad array of Ralph Lauren, Double RL, Polo, and Lauren apparel, footwear
& accessories, watch and jewelry, fragrance, and home product assortments, and reinforce the luxury image of our brands. While investing in digital
commerce operations remains a primary focus, it is an extension of our investment in the integrated omni-channel strategy used to operate our overall retail
business, in which our digital commerce operations are interdependent with our physical stores.
Our Wholesale Business
Our wholesale business sells our products globally primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and golf and pro shops, as well as to various
third-party digital partners. We have continued to focus on elevating our brand by improving in-store product assortment and presentation, as well as full-
price sell-throughs to consumers. As of the end of Fiscal 2025, our wholesale products were sold through over 9,400 doors worldwide, with the majority in
specialty stores. Our products are also increasingly being sold through the digital commerce sites of many of our traditional wholesale customers and our
third-party digital partners.
The primary product offerings sold through our wholesale channels of distribution include apparel, footwear & accessories, and home product
assortments. Our luxury brands, including Ralph Lauren Collection and Ralph Lauren Purple Label, are distributed worldwide through a limited number of
premier fashion retailers. In North America, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, and to a lesser extent, specialty
stores. In Europe, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the
country, as well as to various third-party digital partners. In Asia, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores and various
third-party digital partners. We also distribute our wholesale products to certain licensed stores operated by our partners in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and
emerging markets.
We sell most of our excess and out-of-season products through secondary distribution channels worldwide, including our retail outlet stores.
Worldwide Wholesale Distribution Channels
The following table presents by segment the approximate number of our primary full-price wholesale doors of distribution as of March 29, 2025:
Doors
North America
3,000

Total
9,450 
In addition to our conventional wholesale doors, our products are increasingly being sold through the websites of many of our traditional wholesale
customers, as well as those of our third-party digital partners. As of March 29, 2025, our wholesale business served approximately 120 third-party digital
partners, primarily in Europe.
We have three key wholesale customers that generate significant sales volume. During Fiscal 2025, sales to our three largest wholesale customers
accounted for approximately 12% of our total net revenues. Approximately 70% of sales to our three largest wholesale customers related to our North
America segment and approximately 30% related to our Europe segment.
Our products are sold primarily by our own sales forces. Our wholesale business maintains its primary showrooms in New York City, as well as
regional showrooms in London, Madrid, Milan, Munich, Paris, and Stockholm. In addition, we utilize virtual showrooms, allowing our customers to
experience and discover our product assortments in a retail setting remotely.

================================================================================
Shop-within-Shops.    As a critical element of our distribution to department stores, we and our licensing partners utilize shop-within-shops to enhance
brand recognition, to permit more complete merchandising of our lines by the department stores, and to differentiate the presentation of our products.
The following table presents by segment the approximate number of shop-within-shops in our primary full-price distribution network as of March 29,
2025:
Shop-within-Shops
North America
6,300 
Europe
7,000 
Asia
1,050 
Total
14,350 
The size of our shop-within-shops ranges from approximately 80 to 9,200 square feet. Shop-within-shop fixed assets primarily include items such as
customized freestanding fixtures, wall cases and components, decorative items, and flooring. We normally share in the cost of building out these shop-within-
shops with our wholesale customers.
Replenishment Program.    Core products such as knit shirts, chino pants, oxford cloth shirts, select footwear & accessories, and home products can be
ordered by our wholesale customers at any time through our replenishment program. We generally ship these products within two to five days of order
receipt.
Backlog.    We generally receive wholesale orders approximately three to five months prior to the time the products are delivered to customers, except
for orders received through our replenishment program which ship within two to five days of order receipt. Our wholesale orders are generally subject to
broad cancellation rights. Further, the size of our order backlog depends on several factors, including the timing of the market weeks for our particular lines
during which a significant percentage of our orders are received and the timing of shipments, which varies from year-to-year with consideration for holidays,
consumer trends, concept plans, and the replenishment program's usage. Consequently, the dollar amount of our backlog as of any date may not be indicative
of actual future shipments and therefore is not meaningful in understanding our business as a whole.
Our Licensing Business
Through licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight, design, and marketing skills with the specific product or geographic competencies of
our licensing partners to create and build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners who are leaders in their respective markets, contribute the
majority of product development costs, provide the operational infrastructure required to support the business, and own the inventory. Our licensing business
has been aggregated with other non-reportable segments.
Product Licensing
We grant our product licensees the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated
products, such as certain apparel categories, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings. Each product licensing partner pays us royalties based upon its sales
of our products, generally subject to a minimum royalty requirement for the right to use our trademarks and design services. In addition, our licensing partners
may be required to allocate a portion of their revenues to advertising our products and sharing in the creative costs associated with these products. Larger
allocations typically are required in connection with launches of new products or in new territories. Our license agreements generally have three to five-year
terms and may grant the licensees conditional renewal options.
We work closely with all of our licensing partners to ensure that their products are developed, marketed, and distributed to reach the intended consumer
and are presented consistently across product categories to convey the distinctive identity and lifestyle associated with our brands. Virtually all aspects of the
design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising, and promotion of Ralph Lauren products are subject to our prior approval and
continuing oversight. We perform a broader range of services for most of our Ralph Lauren Home licensing partners than we do for our other licensing
partners, including design, operating showrooms, marketing, and advertising.

area and source products from us, our product licensing partners, and/or independent sources. International licensees' rights may include the right to own and
operate retail stores. As of March 29, 2025, our international licensing partners operated 116 stores.
Digital Ecosystem
Investing in our digital ecosystem remains a primary focus and is a key component of our integrated global omni-channel strategy that spans across
owned and partnered channels, both physical and digital. Our digital ecosystem is comprised of directly-operated platforms, wholesale partner websites, third-
party digital pure players, social commerce, and third-party gaming platforms.
Our directly-operated digital commerce sites and mobile application represent our digital flagships, featuring the most elevated expression of our
brands. The strategy for our digital flagships is to deliver distinct and immersive brand experiences, continuously enhance consumer experience, and develop
digital content that drives deeper consumer engagement and conversion. We continue to optimize our customer experience globally with the introduction of
numerous features including new payment methods and improved search capabilities, as well as greater personalization and enhanced content. In conjunction
with introducing new features, we have focused on foundational needs ranging from platform enhancements to technology solutions to operational
efficiencies. Driving our long-term growth strategy, we also continue to scale and expand our Connected Retail capabilities to enhance the consumer
experience and leverage inventory across direct-to-consumer channels, which include Online Appointment Bookings, Digital Clienteling, Endless Aisle, Buy
Online-Ship from Store, Buy Online-Pick up In Store, Same-Day Delivery, and Mobile Point of Sale and contactless payments, among other capabilities.
Our products are also sold through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers across the globe. With all partners in our ecosystem,
we seek to showcase the brand consistently with our values. We collaborate with our key wholesale customers to deliver the right content to the right
audience, and leverage consumer insights to develop a holistic, channel-agnostic view of our consumer.
13


================================================================================
[PAGE 16 OF 144]
================================================================================
We also sell our products online through various third-party digital pure-play sites to reach a broader audience of consumers, including younger
consumers, and amplify our brand messages. On many of these sites, we have created digital shop-in-shop environments with a consistent brand experience,
tailored product stories, and an assortment that is carefully curated by our merchants. We also partner closely with our pure-play customers on marketing
content and events, as well as optimizing search and other data analyses to drive higher traffic and conversion for our brands.
In connection with our digital commerce operations, we engage consumers through various digital and social media platforms, which are supported
through our collaboration with influencers who have an authentic connection to our brand. Ralph Lauren brands are also represented in several gaming
platforms, providing digital apparel offerings and virtual brand experiences that attract younger consumers.
Seasonality of Business
Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale sales
in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods
impacting our retail business and timing of seasonal wholesale shipments. As a result of changes in our business, consumer spending patterns, and the
macroeconomic environment, including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events, historical quarterly operating trends and
working capital requirements may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating income (loss), and cash flows in
any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns.
Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital requirements typically increase during the first half of the fiscal year as
inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling periods and, accordingly, typically decrease during the second half of the fiscal year as inventory is
shipped/sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the second half of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements during
that period.
Product Design
Our products reflect a timeless and innovative interpretation of American style with a strong global appeal. Our consistent emphasis on new and
distinctive design has been an important contributor to the prominence, strength, and reputation of the Ralph Lauren brands.
Our Ralph Lauren products are designed by, and under the direction of, Mr. Ralph Lauren and our design teams. We form design teams around our
brands and product categories to develop concepts, themes, and products for each brand and category. Through close collaboration with merchandising, sales,
and product management staff, these teams support all of our businesses in order to gain market information and other valuable input.
Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing and advertising programs communicate the themes and images of our brands and are integral to the success of our product offerings.
The majority of our advertising programs are created and executed by our in-house creative and advertising agency to ensure consistency of presentation,
which are complemented by our marketing experts in each region who help to execute our localized strategies.
We create distinctive image advertising for our brands, conveying the particular message of each one within the context of the overall Ralph Lauren
portfolio. Advertisements often portray a lifestyle rather than a specific item and may include a variety of products offered by us and, in some cases, our
licensing partners. Our communication campaigns are increasingly being executed through digital and social media platforms to drive further engagement
with the younger consumer. With regard to influencers, we believe in fostering long-term relationships with those who have an authentic connection to our
brand and influence the areas of culture that matter most to our audiences. We also continue to advertise through print and outdoor media, and, to a lesser
extent, through television and cinema.
Our digital advertising programs focus on high impact and innovative digital media outlets, which allow us to convey our key brand messages and
lifestyle positioning. We also develop digital editorial initiatives that allow for deeper education and engagement around the Ralph Lauren lifestyle. We
deploy these marketing and advertising initiatives through online, mobile, video, email, and social media. Our digital commerce sites present the Ralph
Lauren lifestyle online, while offering a broad array of our apparel, footwear & accessories, home, fragrances, and hospitality product lines.

================================================================================
[PAGE 17 OF 144]
================================================================================
Additionally, we advertise in consumer and trade publications, and participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with some of our
wholesale and licensing partners. We have outdoor advertising placements in key cities as well, focusing on impact and reach. We also provide point-of-sale
fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation of our products at their retail locations. In addition, when our licensing partners
are required to spend an amount equal to a percentage of their licensed product sales on advertising, in certain cases we coordinate the advertising placement
on their behalf. We believe our investments in shop-within-shop environments and retail stores, including our global flagship locations, contribute to and
enhance the themes of our brands to consumers.
We also conduct a variety of public relations activities, including fashion presentations in major cities such as New York City and Milan. Such fashion
events, in addition to celebrity dressing occasions, including those related to red carpet events, weddings, and major sporting events, and events hosted in our
stores and restaurants, including The Polo Bar in New York City, generate extensive domestic and international media and social coverage.
We are the official outfitter for all on-court officials at the Wimbledon, U.S.  Open, and Australian Open tennis tournaments. These tournaments
provide worldwide exposure for our brand in a relevant lifestyle environment. We also continue to be an Official Outfitter of the U.S. Olympic and
Paralympic Teams, providing the Opening and Closing Ceremony Uniform apparel and a collection of Villagewear apparel and accessories available to men,
women, and children, with the right to manufacture, distribute, advertise, promote, and sell products in the U.S. Most recently, we dressed Team USA for the
Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris in 2024, and we will be dressing the team for the upcoming Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in
Milan in 2026, and the Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games in Los Angeles in 2028. As part of our involvement with Team USA, we have established a
partnership with athletes serving as brand ambassadors and as the faces of our advertising, marketing, and public relations campaigns. We are also an Official
Partner for the Professional Golfers' Association ("PGA") of America and the Official Outfitter of the U.S. Ryder Cup Team, as well as a partner of the
American Junior Golf Association. We sponsor a roster of professional golfers, including Andrea Lee, Billy Horschel, Davis Love III, Devon Bling, Doc
Redman, Jonathan Byrd, Megha Ganne, Nick Watney, Sean Foley, Smylie Kaufman, Todd Anderson, Tom Watson, Trevor Werbylo, Troy Taylor II, Tyler
Strafaci, and Zach Johnson.
We believe our partnerships with such prestigious global athletic events reinforce our brand's Sport & Style heritage in a truly authentic way and serve
to connect our Company and brands to our consumers through their individual areas of passion.
Sourcing, Production and Quality
We contract for the manufacture of our products with suppliers and do not own or operate any production facilities. Approximately 300 different
suppliers worldwide produce our apparel, footwear & accessories, and home products, with no one supplier providing more than 5% of our total products (by
dollar value) during Fiscal 2025.
Our Global Sourcing organization closely supervises these suppliers to make our designs as per our specifications and standards. Ralph Lauren's
Quality Assurance team works with suppliers to ensure best practices are carried out prior to and during production. Compliance to our standards is ensured
through our Quality Control requirements and follow-up inspections and reviews. Both the initial Quality Assurance work and the Quality Control
requirements ensure merchandise is received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.
Management continually monitors political, economic, social, environmental, trade, and labor risks. We manage our exposure through, among other
measures, by diversifying production among countries and suppliers and sourcing from countries with trade preferences. In Fiscal 2025, approximately 96%
of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, with approximately 20% of our products
sourced from Vietnam, 16% from Cambodia, and 12% from China. See "Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations," Item  1A  —  "Risk
Factors — Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions — Economic conditions could have a negative impact on our major customers, suppliers, vendors,
and lenders, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business," and Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations
—  Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our
specifications."
We are committed to conducting our global operations ethically and with respect for the dignity of all people who make our products. All our suppliers
are expected to uphold our Ralph Lauren Operating Standards. These standards require business partners to foster a safe, sustainable, inclusive, and ethical
workplace through continuous improvement. Our Global Citizenship team monitors the compliance of our business partners as part of our due diligence
processes.
Our business model requires us to commit to most of our garment production and related fabric procurement before actual sales occur. In cases where
we overestimate customer demand for specific products or materials, we manage excess inventory by redirecting these items to our outlet stores and other
secondary sales channels.

Competition
Competition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with an extensive range
of designers and manufacturers of apparel, footwear, accessories, fragrances, and home products, both domestic and international. We also face increasing
competition from companies selling our product categories solely through the Internet. Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have
substantially greater resources than us. We compete primarily on the basis of brand strength, timeless style, quality, value, and service, which depend on our
ability to:
•
anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demands and shopping preferences, including the ever-increasing shift to
digital brand engagement, social media communications, and online and cross-channel shopping;
•
create and maintain favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and a reputation for quality, including through digital brand engagement and online and
social media presence;
•

Includes Australia and New Zealand.
All facilities are designed to allow for high-density cube storage and value-added services and utilize unit and carton tracking technology to facilitate
process control and inventory management. The distribution network is managed through globally integrated information technology systems.
Information Systems
Our information systems facilitate business processes, consumer experiences, and decision-making support across the Company and our extended
ecosystem of manufacturers, vendors, business partners, and customers. Our system applications are connected to support the flow of information across
functions, including, but not limited to (i) product design, sourcing, and production; (ii) merchandising planning and buying; (iii) comprehensive order
processing, fulfillment, and distribution; (iv) retail store, digital commerce, and hospitality operations; (v) marketing and advertising; (vi) financial accounting
and management reporting; and (vii) human resources.
Our retail operation systems, including point-of-sale registers and merchandising, planning, and inventory management systems, support operational
processes within our store network and link with our digital commerce processes to support omni-channel capabilities.
We are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems, services, and software. For example, during Fiscal 2025, we continued to enhance
our solutions for advanced analytics, furthering our use of artificial intelligence ("AI"), both predictive and generative, and machine learning ("ML") for areas
such as planning, marketing, and personalization. Our digital commerce enhancements included expanded payment methods, improved search capabilities,
more personalized user experiences, and elevated content offerings.
We are also in the early stages of executing a large-scale multi-year global project that is expected to significantly transform the way in which we
operate our business and further enable our long-term strategic pivot towards a global direct-to-consumer-oriented model (the "Next Generation
Transformation project" or "NGT project"). The NGT project will be completed in phases and involves the redesigning of certain end-to-end processes and
the implementation of a suite of information systems on a global scale. See Item 1 — "Business — Recent Developments" for further discussion regarding our
NGT project.
See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Information Systems and Data Security."
See Item 1C — "Cybersecurity" for discussion regarding our cybersecurity risk management and strategy, as well as our cybersecurity governance.

Wholesale Credit Control
We manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners,
and extend credit based on an evaluation of the wholesale customer's financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. We monitor credit
levels and the financial condition of our wholesale customers on a continuing basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor or underwrite our accounts
receivables, nor do we maintain credit insurance to manage the risk of bad debts. In North America, collection and deduction transactional activities are
primarily provided through a third-party service provider. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations — A substantial
portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of large wholesale customers. Our business could be adversely affected as a result of consolidations,
liquidations, restructurings, other ownership changes in the retail industry, and/or any financial instability of our large wholesale customers."
Trademarks
We own the RALPH LAUREN, POLO, POLO RALPH LAUREN, and the famous Polo Player Design trademarks in the U.S. and over 120 countries
worldwide. Other trademarks that we own include, but are not limited to:
•
PURPLE LABEL;
•
DOUBLE RL;
•
RRL & DESIGN;
•
RLX;
•
RL;
•
LAUREN RALPH LAUREN;
•
PINK PONY;
•
LAUREN;
•
RALPH;
•
POLO BEAR; and
•
CHAPS.
Mr. Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as trademarks RALPH LAUREN, DOUBLE RL, and RRL in perpetuity in connection with, among
other things, beef and living animals. The trademarks DOUBLE RL and RRL are currently used by the Double RL Company, an entity wholly owned by
Mr. R. Lauren. In addition, Mr. R. Lauren has the right to engage in personal projects involving film or theatrical productions (not including or relating to our
business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a company wholly owned by Mr. R. Lauren. Any activity by these companies has no direct impact on us.
Our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items of apparel, apparel-related
products and accessories, home furnishings, restaurant and café services, online services and online publications, and beauty products, as well as in
connection with retail services, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid
and enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. We regard
the license to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and, on a
worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. As a result of the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been the object of
counterfeiting. While we have a broad enforcement program which has been generally effective in protecting our intellectual property rights and limiting the
sale of counterfeit products in the U.S. and in most major markets abroad, we face greater challenges with respect to enforcing our rights against trademark
infringement in certain parts of Asia.
18


================================================================================
[PAGE 21 OF 144]
================================================================================
In markets outside of the U.S., our rights to some or all of our trademarks may not be clearly established. Over the course of our international
expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks, including POLO and/or a
representation of a Polo Player Design, which impede our use and registration of our principal trademarks. While such conflicts are common and may arise
again from time to time as we continue our international expansion, we have, in general, successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both legal
action and negotiated settlements with third-party owners of the conflicting marks (see Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and
Operations — Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the U.S." and Item 3 — "Legal Proceedings"
for further discussion). Although we have not suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot
assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce trademarks to new markets.
Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations
Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand is subject to duties. In addition, most of the
countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas and duties to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market
disruption. The U.S. and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported at unfairly traded
prices in such increased quantities that would cause (or threaten) injury to the relevant domestic industry (generally known as "anti-dumping" actions). If
dumping is suspected in the U.S., the U.S. government may self-initiate a dumping case on behalf of the U.S. textile industry which could significantly affect
our costs. Furthermore, additional duties, generally known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the U.S. government to offset subsidies provided
by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a U.S. industry.
In addition, each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. Because the U.S. and the other countries in
which our products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, or adjust
presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of import restrictions and opportunities. We seek to minimize
our potential exposure to import-related risks through, among other measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts of production among
countries and manufacturers, and through geographical diversification of our sources of supply.
As almost all of our products are manufactured by foreign suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international
trade regulations or executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in sourcing patterns could adversely affect our operations. We are also subject to
other international trade agreements, such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Peru Free Trade
Agreement, the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement and other special trade preference programs. A portion of our
imported products are eligible for certain of these duty-advantaged programs. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, and Tax
Matters — Our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks" and "Risk Factors —
Risks Related to our Business and Operations — Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to
produce our goods on time and to our specifications."
Apparel and other products sold by us are under the jurisdiction of multiple governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade
Commission, U.S. Customs & Border Protection, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Consumer Products
Safety Commission. Our products are also subject to regulation in the U.S. and other countries, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement
Act, which relate principally to product labeling, licensing requirements, and consumer product safety requirements and regulatory testing, particularly with
respect to products used by children. Any failure to comply with such requirements could result in significant penalties and require us to recall products,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these regulations, as
well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. Our licensed
products, licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, and the vendors and factories with which we contract for the manufacture and distribution of our
products are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, vendors, and factories to operate in compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our
business or operating results.
19


================================================================================
[PAGE 22 OF 144]
================================================================================
We are also subject to disclosure and reporting requirements, established under existing or new federal or state laws, such as the requirements to
identify the origin and existence of certain "conflict minerals" under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and disclosures of
specific actions to eradicate abusive labor practices in our supply chain under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. While we require our
suppliers to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and our operating guidelines which promote ethical and socially responsible business practices,
any violation of labor, environmental, health, and safety or other laws, or any divergence by an independent supplier's labor practices from generally accepted
industry standards, could damage our reputation, disrupt our sourcing capabilities, and increase the cost of doing business, adversely affecting our results of
operations. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations — Our business could suffer if we fail to comply with labor laws
or if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental practices."
Although we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant
impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets.
Human Capital
Our purpose is to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. This purpose extends to how we provide resources to
support our employees' health, well-being, work-life harmony, and quality of life. We believe that attracting, developing, and retaining a diverse work force
that is both skilled and motivated is critical to the successful execution of our long-term growth strategy. To this end, we are committed to creating a culture
and work environment in which all employees feel welcome and can thrive, both as individuals and as part of our team.
Our Board of Directors regularly reviews our people and development strategic initiatives.
Our Employees
As of March  29, 2025, we had approximately 23,400 employees, comprised of approximately 15,000 full-time and 8,400 part-time employees.
Approximately 9,800 of our employees are located in the U.S. and 13,600 are located in foreign countries.
As of March  29, 2025, approximately 64% and 36% of our global workforce self-identified as female and male, respectively. In the U.S.,
approximately 59% of our workforce self-identified as an underrepresented race and ethnic group and 34% self-identified as White, with the remaining 7%
electing not to disclose such information.
Belonging & Equity
We believe a diversity of backgrounds, skills, and experiences of our employees and our culture of inclusivity drive innovation and creativity. We are
committed to further strengthening a sense of belonging and equal opportunities for all within our Company. Our strategy is guided by the following three
focus areas:
1.
Talent — We ensure that fostering a culture of inclusion and belonging is a priority company-wide, resulting in the cultivation of diverse, best-in-
class teams and equal opportunities for development. We also plan to drive progress towards our goal of exceeding an 80% employee survey
score on "my manager creates a sense of belonging for the entire team."
2.
Engagement — We enable open dialogue and create opportunities for the amplification of all voices and perspectives. Our Employee Impact
Groups harness the talent and passion of our employees from around the world to help create an inclusive and engaging company culture.
3.
Learning — We remain dedicated to the growth and advancement of our talent and offer a wide range of development programs for all levels,
including on-the-job training, coaching, and skill-building through our various customized learning and training programs. All our employee
learning and development programs aim to promote our Ralph Lauren Success Drivers — the key attributes, skills, ways of thinking, and
behaviors that ultimately create conditions that better enable individuals and teams to succeed.
Additional information relating to our initiatives can be found in our most recently published Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report covering
Fiscal 2024, which is available on our corporate website at https://corporate.ralphlauren.com/citizenship-and-sustainability. Our Global Citizenship &
Sustainability Report covering Fiscal 2025 is expected to be released in September 2025. The content of our sustainability reports is not incorporated by
reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.

================================================================================
Talent Development
Throughout Fiscal 2025, we evolved from a focus on Talent Development to a more holistic approach under the Employee Learning Experience. This
transformation reflects our commitment to providing meaningful, purpose-driven learning opportunities that resonate on a personal level, evoke emotion, and
inspire thoughtful self-reflection and connection to our Purpose and Strategy.
The Employee Learning Experience model enables us to offer more tailored, meaningful learning journeys that align with our purpose and foster
continuous development. A cornerstone of this transformation has been the continued delivery of Situational Leadership® II ("SLII") for all people leaders.
This experience reinforces a shared understanding of leadership development and strengthens our ability to grow high-performing teams that drive
organizational success. Building on the foundation of SLII, a key highlight of Fiscal 2025 has been the launch of Purpose Driven Coaching. As we evolve our
leadership philosophy, we are transitioning from traditional management styles to a coaching-oriented mindset. This shift promotes greater accountability,
while ensuring employees feel seen, heard, and valued — fundamentally enhancing engagement and performance.
In parallel, we have placed significant emphasis on career development and aspirations. Our goal is to empower employees to take ownership of their
career journeys by providing visibility into various career paths and organizational functions. This initiative has included Career Aspiration Days, where
employees engage in interactive learning sessions and connect directly with cross-functional teams to explore required skills and competencies. In Europe and
Asia we also launched our Associate Career Development Journeys highlighting key skills and behaviors required to grow and develop at each level.
Additionally, we have introduced comprehensive Career Aspiration Toolkits for managers. These resources are designed to support meaningful career
conversations and help teams navigate the full spectrum of career growth opportunities within the organization.
These initiatives reflect our unwavering commitment to building a culture of continuous learning, intentional growth, and empowered leadership
aligned with our Purpose — positioning us for long-term success.
Employee Safety and Well-Being
We are committed to the safety, health, and overall well-being of each of our employees and their families, providing a wide array of physical,
emotional, social, and financial support to meet this objective. THRIVE, our global wellness program and related application tool, provides access to
volunteer events and physical and mental wellness support. The THRIVE application also provides a daily pulse question through Microsoft Teams, which
links to additional wellness articles based on an employee's response. In addition, these pulse responses are tracked so that employees can view their well-
being progress. In partnership with THRIVE, we also introduced a variety of activations throughout the year — from educational webinars on topics such as
family, mind, finance, harmony, and health, to Wellness Journeys, a three-part training series delivered in each region and tailored to local Health & Wellness
priorities. These efforts also included a company-wide Summer Challenge focused on promoting physical activity.
To streamline access to our resources and ensure consistency across all markets, we rebranded and relaunched our global wellness offering under the
unified name RL Wellness. This shift reinforces our global approach to employee well-being and introduces new tools, including the RL Wellness Catalogue
— a comprehensive, evergreen resource that clearly outlines the support available in each region — and the Quarterly Wellness Digest, a global initiative
designed to increase visibility and alignment of our Health & Wellness efforts across all three regions. Part of these efforts include conversations with external
mental health and wellness experts — including Olympians, leading psychologists, and best-selling authors — who shared insights to support and inspire our
global teams.
We also continue to offer key well-being services around the world, including Gympass in the U.S., which supports physical and mental wellness
through access to thousands of fitness centers and digital health partners; Bond in France, the United Kingdom, and the U.S., a personal safety app that
provides real-time support from trained security professionals in situations that may feel unsafe; and Benefit Station in Japan, providing discounts on gyms,
travel, language schools, restaurants, childcare, and elderly care services.

================================================================================
Compensation and Benefits
We are committed to providing competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain a diverse and talented workforce. In addition, we take a
proactive approach to pay equity and continually monitor our compensation programs to promote fairness.
We offer a wide array of both employer-paid and employee-paid benefits to support our employees' overall financial, physical, and mental well-being,
including, but not limited to, healthcare and welfare benefits, retirement savings, paid time off, temporary leave, sabbaticals, and flexible work arrangements.
We understand that everyone has unique needs when it comes to caring for and growing their families.
With the rise in cancer diagnoses, specifically around breast cancer and skin cancer, starting in January 2025, we are providing free additional coverage
to essential screenings above the national guidelines to lower overall cost of treatment for our U.S. employees and provide better outcomes for those
impacted. In addition, all Ralph Lauren employees and their eligible dependents will have the ability to virtually meet and consult with an expert from
Memorial Sloan Kettering for free if they receive a cancer diagnosis.
In previous years, part-time employee benefits eligibility was determined by the average number of hours worked per week in a 12-month lookback
period. Now, all part-time employees with one year of service, regardless of average hours worked, will be eligible for Ralph Lauren benefits for calendar
2025. Our two medical plan options have been enhanced to provide more coverage, such as diagnostic doctor's visits, and one of our medical plan options
also includes additional coverage, such as diagnostic testing and prescription drugs. In addition, dental and vision coverage is also available and can be
purchased without the requirement to bundle with a medical plan.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors
There are risks associated with an investment in our securities. The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our
business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risk factors could materially adversely
affect our business, including our prospects, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the trading price of our securities, and/or the actual outcome
of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently
view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in future periods or if circumstances change.
Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions
Economic, political, and other conditions, including the imposition of significant new tariffs or other changes to existing trade policies and
agreements, may adversely affect the global economy and/or the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products,
including our products.
The global economy and retail industry are impacted by many uncontrollable factors, including, among others, diplomatic and trade relationships,
including potential changes to international trade policies or agreements, such as the imposition of new tariffs; general domestic and international political
conditions; consumer perceptions of current and future economic conditions, including any recessionary fears; inflation; interest rates; foreign currency
exchange rates; the availability and price of commodities, including fuel and energy costs; employment levels and wage rates; stock market performance; the
housing market; consumer debt levels; the availability of consumer credit; the health and stability of the banking sector; global food supplies; taxation; the
threat, outbreak, or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts, or other hostilities; consumer perceptions of personal well-being and safety; man-made or
natural disasters, including pandemic diseases; and weather conditions.
Most recently, the U.S. announced significant changes to its trade policies, including widespread tariff increases on imported goods (including on those
countries from which we import a substantial amount of our finished products, most notably Vietnam, Cambodia, and China) with potential further increases
and revisions or terminations to existing trade agreements. In response, many countries have announced or are otherwise considering retaliatory tariffs on
U.S. exports and other trade restrictions. This has led to significant uncertainty regarding the future relationship between the U.S. and other countries, as well
as growing concerns about a global trade war, higher inflation, and a potential global recession, which has already caused significant volatility of global stock
markets and foreign currency exchange rates.
Other recent economic conditions, including ongoing inflationary pressures, organized labor disputes, high interest rates, significant foreign currency
volatility, and military conflicts (as discussed below), continue to impact consumer discretionary income levels, spending, and sentiment in the U.S. and
beyond. In response to such pressures, as well as to reduce elevated inventory levels, many retailers (particularly in the U.S.) continue to resort to promotional
activity in an attempt to offset traffic declines and increase conversion. Our gross margins could be adversely impacted if we were to apply a similar strategy
over a prolonged period of time.
The global economy has also been negatively impacted by ongoing military conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, militant
attacks on cargo vessels in the Red Sea, and other hostilities in the Middle East. Although our voluntary decision to suspend operations in Russia has not
resulted in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements and our ongoing operations in Israel are also not material, our business has been, and
may continue to be, affected by the broader macroeconomic implications resulting from these and other military conflicts, including inflationary pressures,
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, increases in energy prices, food shortages, and financial market volatility, among other factors, which have
adversely impacted consumer sentiment and confidence. Although our business has not been significantly impacted by the Red Sea crisis, it could lead to
shipping delays, inventory shortages, and/or higher freight costs in the near future and beyond. It is not clear at this time how long these conflicts will endure,
or if they will escalate further with additional countries declaring war against each other, which could further amplify the impacts of the various
macroeconomic factors described above and potentially result in a global recession.
Consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, tend to decline during periods of recession, high
inflation, or rising interest rates, and at other times when disposable income is lower. Unfavorable economic conditions and other factors, such as pandemic
diseases and other health-related concerns, political unrest, military conflicts, and acts of terrorism, may also reduce consumers' willingness and ability to
travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores and shop-within-shops are located. Further, consumers may prefer to spend more of their
discretionary income on "experiences," such as dining and entertainment, over consumer goods. Stay-at-home orders, social gathering restrictions, and work-
from-home arrangements, such as those resulting from pandemic diseases, may also diminish consumers' demand for luxury apparel products. Accordingly, a
downturn or an uncertain outlook in the economies in which
24

we, or our wholesale customers and licensing partners, sell our products, or other changes in consumer preferences, may materially adversely affect our
business.
Economic conditions could have a negative impact on our major customers, suppliers, vendors, and lenders, which in turn could materially
adversely affect our business.
Although we believe that our existing cash and investments, cash provided by operations, and available borrowing capacity under our credit and
overdraft facilities and commercial paper borrowing program will provide us with sufficient liquidity, the impact of adverse economic conditions (such as
ongoing inflationary pressures and high interest rates) on our major customers, suppliers, vendors, and lenders and their ability to access global capital
markets cannot be predicted. The inability of third parties to manufacture and/or ship our products due to insufficient liquidity or otherwise could impair our
ability to meet the delivery date requirements of our customers. A disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious
disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in their future orders of our products and the inability or
failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Any deterioration in global financial or capital markets could affect our ability to access sources of liquidity to provide for our future cash needs,
increase the cost of any future financing, or cause our lenders to be unable to meet their funding commitments under our credit and overdraft facilities. We
also regularly maintain domestic cash deposits in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insured banks, which exceed the FDIC insurance limits. In
addition, we maintain cash deposits in foreign banks where we operate, some of which are not insured or are only partially insured by the FDIC or other
similar agencies. Bank failures, events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions,
or concerns or rumors about such events, may lead to liquidity constraints. The failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets
impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, could adversely impact our liquidity and financial performance. There can be no assurance
that our deposits in excess of the FDIC or other comparable insurance limits will be backstopped by the U.S. or applicable foreign government, or that any
bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions, or by acquisition in
the event of a failure or liquidity crisis. Our major customers, suppliers, and vendors may also be subject to similar risks, which in turn could have a resulting
material adverse impact on our business if they were to lose access to sufficient liquidity.
Our business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations.
Our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. Specifically, changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies
impact our financial results from a transactional perspective, as our foreign operations generally purchase inventory in U.S. Dollars. Given that we source
most of our products overseas, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. Changes in currency exchange
rates may also impact consumers' willingness or ability to travel abroad and/or purchase our products while traveling, as well as affect the U.S. Dollar value
of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international businesses sell products. Additionally, the operating results and financial position of our
international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as their financial results are translated from the respective local currency into U.S.
Dollars during the financial statement consolidation process. The foreign currencies to which we are exposed to from a transactional and translational
perspective primarily include the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the British Pound Sterling, the South Korean Won, the Chinese Renminbi, the Canadian Dollar, the
Swiss Franc, and the Australian Dollar. The expansion of our international business increases our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.
Although we hedge certain exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot fully
anticipate all of our currency exposures and therefore foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, factors
that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging activities include the volatility of currency markets, the accuracy of forecasted transactions, and the
availability of hedging instruments. As such, our hedging activities may not completely mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of
operations.
Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Widespread public health emergencies or infectious disease outbreaks, such as the novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19,
have had, and could again in the future have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Potential impacts to our
business include, but are not limited to: (i) our ability to successfully execute our long-term growth strategy; (ii) supply chain disruptions resulting from
closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, shipping and loading capacity constraints, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in
infected areas, including any related cost increases; (iii) reduced retail traffic at our stores and those of our wholesale
25

================================================================================
customers and licensing partners due to forced closures or other operational restrictions, such as reduced capacity limits and operating hours, declines in
tourism, and/or potential changes in consumer behavior and shopping preferences, such as their willingness to congregate in shopping centers or other
populated locations and the overall growing preference to shop online versus at traditional brick and mortar locations; (iv) potential declines in the level of
consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, caused by higher unemployment and lower disposable income
levels, inflationary pressures, travel and social gathering restrictions, work-from-home arrangements, or other factors beyond our control; (v) the potential
build-up of excess inventory as a result of store closures and/or lower consumer demand; (vi) temporary closures or other operational restrictions of our
distribution centers and/or corporate facilities; (vii) our ability to attract, retain, and manage employees; (viii) additional costs to protect the health and safety
of our employees, customers, and communities, such as more frequent and thorough cleanings of our facilities and supplying personal protection equipment;
(ix) the potential loss of one or more of our significant wholesale customers or licensing partners, or the loss of a large number of smaller wholesale
customers or licensing partners, if they are not able to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions, and our ability to collect outstanding
receivables; (x) increased vulnerability to data security or privacy breaches as a result of remote working arrangements; (xi) our ability to successfully
negotiate with landlords to obtain rent abatements, rent deferrals, and other relief; (xii) our ability to access capital markets and maintain compliance with
covenants associated with our existing debt instruments, as well as the ability of our key customers, suppliers, and vendors to do the same with regard to their
own obligations; (xiii) our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support our operations, including repayment of our debt obligations as they become due,
as well as to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock; (xiv) diversion of management
attention and resources from ongoing business activities and/or a decrease in employee morale; and (xv) our ability to maintain an effective system of internal
controls and compliance with the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Risks Related to our Strategic Initiatives and Restructuring Activities
We cannot assure the successful implementation of our growth strategy.
We have developed a long-term growth strategy with the objective of delivering sustainable, profitable growth and long-term value creation for
shareholders, as outlined in Item 1 — "Business — Objectives and Opportunities." Our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy is subject to
various risks and uncertainties, as described herein.
Although we believe that our growth strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, there can be no assurance regarding the timing
of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits, if at all. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits, which may be due to our inability to
execute the various elements of our growth strategy, changes in consumer preferences, competition, economic conditions (including potential changes to
existing trade policies and agreements, including higher tariffs on U.S. imports, as well as inflationary pressures), and other risks described herein, such as
those related to pandemic diseases, supply chain disruptions, and military conflicts or other hostilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Such a failure could also result in the implementation of new restructuring-related activities, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term.
Achievement of our growth strategy may require investment in new capabilities, distribution channels, and technologies, such as those related to our
Next Generation Transformation project. These investments may result in short-term costs without accompanying current revenues and, therefore, may be
dilutive to our earnings in the short term. There can be no assurance regarding the timing of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits of these
investments and other costs, if at all.
We may not be successful in the expansion of our multi-channel distribution network or accelerating growth in certain product categories.
Implementation of our growth strategy involves the continuation and expansion of our multi-channel distribution network, including within
international markets such as China, which is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to (i) identify new or underpenetrated markets
where our products and brand will be accepted by consumers; (ii) attract customers, particularly in new markets; (iii) identify desirable freestanding and
department store locations, the availability of which may be out of our control; (iv) negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement
allowances; (v) efficiently and cost effectively build-out stores and shop-within-shops; (vi) source sufficient inventory levels timely to meet the needs of the
new stores and shop-within-shops; (vii) hire, train, and retain competent store personnel; and (viii) integrate new stores and shop-within-shops into our
existing systems and operations.
Any of these challenges could delay or otherwise prevent us from successfully executing our distribution expansion strategy. There can be no assurance
that our new stores and shop-within-shops will be successful and profitable or if the capital costs associated with the build-out of such new locations will be
recovered. Further, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new or existing competitors that have a more established market presence than
us or other competitive advantages. Other risks related to our international expansion plans include (i) changes in general economic conditions in specific
countries and markets, including those resulting from inflationary pressures, pandemic diseases, natural or man-made
26


================================================================================
[PAGE 29 OF 144]
================================================================================
disasters, civil or political instability, or military conflicts, terrorist acts, or other hostilities; (ii) changes in diplomatic and trade relationships and any
resulting anti-American sentiment; (iii) foreign government regulation; (iv) risks associated with importing products; and (v) restrictions on the repatriation of
funds held internationally, among other risks described herein. If our expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our
investments, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
The success of our business also depends largely on our ability to continue to maintain, enhance, and expand our digital footprint and capabilities.
Consumers continue to increasingly shop online using computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices, and also use such devices to perform comparison
shopping on a real-time basis. Certain adverse events, such as pandemic diseases and severe weather, tend to amplify this trend, as consumers may find it
difficult to travel to our brick and mortar locations or otherwise prefer to avoid populated locations, such as indoor shopping centers. Any failure on our part,
or on the part of our third-party digital partners, to provide attractive, reliable, secure, and user-friendly digital commerce platforms, including mobile apps,
could negatively impact our customers' shopping experience resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands, and lost sales. In addition,
as we continue to expand and increase the global presence of our digital commerce business, sales from our brick and mortar stores and wholesale channels of
distribution in areas where digital commerce sites are introduced may decline due to changes in consumer shopping habits and cannibalization.
Our growth strategy also includes accelerating growth in certain high-potential, underdeveloped product categories, comprised of women's apparel,
outerwear, and handbags. We compete with other retailers in these product categories, some of which may be significantly larger than us and more established
in these product categories, and competition is intense, as described within other risk factors herein. There can be no assurance that our targeted expansion in
these product categories will be successful.
The success of our business depends on our ability to respond to constantly changing fashion and retail trends and consumer preferences in a timely
manner, develop products that resonate with our existing customers and attract new customers, and provide a seamless shopping experience to our
customers.
The industries in which we operate have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. Our success depends in
large part on our ability to originate and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge, and react to changing consumer
preferences in a timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers worldwide across various price points whose preferences cannot be
predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change, influenced by fashion trends, economic conditions, and weather conditions, among other factors. This
issue is further compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared
across the globe. We cannot assure that we will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or successfully meet constantly changing consumer
preferences in the future. In addition, we cannot assure that any new products or brands that we introduce will be successfully received by consumers. Any
failure on our part to anticipate, identify, and respond effectively to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends could adversely affect consumer
acceptance of our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer
demand for our products or if manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. Any of these
outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our marketing and advertising programs are integral to the success of our product offerings and on our ability to attract new customers and retain
existing customers. Our communication campaigns are increasingly being executed through digital and social media platforms to drive further engagement
with the younger consumer, with a focus on influencers. However, we cannot assure that our marketing and advertising programs will be successful or appeal
to consumers. Ineffective marketing and advertising programs could impede our ability to maintain brand relevance, attract new customers, or retain existing
customers.
The success of our business also depends on our ability to continue to develop and maintain a reliable omni-channel experience for our customers, as
well as our ability to introduce new Connected Retail capabilities, such as those described in Item 1 — "Business — Digital Ecosystem." Our business has
evolved from an in-store experience to a shopping experience through multiple technologies, including computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices, as
our customers have become increasingly technologically savvy and expect a seamless omni-channel experience regardless of whether they are shopping in
stores or online. We are increasingly using digital and social media platforms to interact with customers and enhance their shopping experience. If we are
unable to develop and continuously improve our customer-facing technologies, the efforts of which typically require significant capital investments, we may
not be able to provide a convenient and consistent experience to our customers regardless of the sales channel. This could negatively affect our ability to
compete with other retailers and result in diminished loyalty to our brands, which could adversely impact our business.
We implement new store design concepts and other renovations to our existing store portfolio as part of our growth strategy. There can be no assurance
that any of our store designs will resonate with customers or otherwise achieve the desired sales and profitability measures necessary to recover our initial
capital investments. If customers are not receptive to the design layout or visual merchandising of our stores, our business could be adversely affected. In
addition, the failure of our store
27


================================================================================
[PAGE 30 OF 144]
================================================================================
designs to achieve acceptable results could lead to asset impairment charges and/or our decision to close a store prior to the lease expiration date resulting in
other store closure-related charges, including early lease termination fees.
Our retail stores are generally located in shopping malls or other shopping centers. Our sales at such stores, as well as our flagship locations, are largely
dependent upon the volume of retail traffic in those shopping centers and the surrounding area. Retail traffic to our stores has been, and may continue to be,
negatively impacted by disruptions caused by adverse economic conditions, pandemic diseases, natural or man-made disasters, severe weather conditions,
declines in tourism, the increasing shift towards digital commerce channels, and other various factors beyond our control. Any significant declines in retail
traffic in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our profitability may decline if we are unable to effectively manage inventory or as a result of increasing pressure on margins.
The nature of the apparel retail industry requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when
we build up our inventory levels in order to meet anticipated consumer demand. Although we have shortened lead times for the design, sourcing, and
production of certain of our product lines, we expect to continue to place orders with our vendors for the majority of products in advance of the related selling
season. As a result, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences and demand and pricing shifts. Our failure to continue to shorten lead times or to
correctly anticipate consumer preferences and demand could result in the build-up of excess inventory. Other factors beyond our control could also result in
the build-up of excess inventory, including unforeseen adverse economic conditions or business disruptions, such as those caused by pandemic diseases.
Excess inventory levels could result in the utilization of less-preferred distribution channels, markdowns, promotional sales, donations, or destruction to
dispose of such excess or slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our overall profitability and/or impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if
we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory
shortages, which may negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty, and result in lost sales. Any of these outcomes could have a material
adverse effect on our business.
Additionally, our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including inflationary pressures, intense competition and a
highly promotional retail environment, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, excess inventory levels in
the marketplace, and changes in consumer spending patterns. Changes to existing trade policies and agreements, including higher tariffs on U.S. imports,
could exacerbate such pricing pressures. Although we continue to limit our promotional activity in connection with our quality of sales initiatives, these
factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline. If our sales prices decline and we
fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability will decline. In addition, changes in our customer, channel, and geographic
sales mix could have a negative impact on our profitability. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring plans.
We have implemented restructuring plans to support key strategic initiatives. Although designed to deliver long-term sustainable growth, restructuring
plans present significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, or otherwise harm
our business, including (i) higher than anticipated costs in implementing planned workforce reductions, particularly in highly regulated locations outside the
U.S.; (ii) higher than anticipated lease termination and store or facility closure costs; (iii) failure to meet operational targets or customer requirements due to
the loss of employees or inadequate transfer of knowledge; (iv) failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing, and subsequent to
completing, our restructuring plans; (v) diversion of management attention and resources from ongoing business activities and/or a decrease in employee
morale; (vi) attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce; and (vii) damage to our reputation and brand image due to our restructuring-related
activities.
If we are not successful in implementing and managing our restructuring plans, we may not be able to achieve targeted operating enhancements, sales
growth, and/or cost reductions, which could adversely impact our business. Our failure to achieve targeted results for any reason, including business
disruptions resulting from adverse economic conditions or catastrophic events such as pandemic diseases, could also lead to the implementation of additional
restructuring-related activities, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term.
Risks Related to our Business and Operations
The loss of the services of Mr. Ralph Lauren or any other changes to our executive and senior management team may be disruptive to, or cause
uncertainty in, our business.
Mr. Ralph Lauren's leadership in the design and marketing areas of our business has been a critical element of our success since the inception of our
Company. Mr. R. Lauren is instrumental to, and closely identified with, our brand that bears
28


================================================================================
[PAGE 31 OF 144]
================================================================================
his name. Our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with Mr. R. Lauren's name may be damaged if we were to lose his
services. The death or disability of Mr. R. Lauren or other extended or permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or industry perception with
respect to him or arising from his loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We also depend on the service and management experience of other key executive officers and members of senior management who have substantial
experience and expertise in our industry and our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. Any changes in our executive
and senior management team, including those resulting from our restructuring actions, may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business and future
strategic direction. The departure of any key individual and the failure to ensure a smooth transition and effective transfer of knowledge involving senior
employees could hinder or delay our strategic planning and execution, as well as adversely affect our ability to attract and retain other experienced and
talented employees. The success of our business also depends on our ability to attract and retain an adequate number of qualified employees to operate our
retail stores and distribution centers and to perform various corporate functions.
Competition in our industry to attract and retain employees is intense and is influenced by our reputation, our ability to offer competitive compensation
and benefits, and economic conditions, among other factors. Furthermore, the retail industry (among others) has experienced, and could again experience in
the future, overall labor shortages resulting from a combination of pandemic diseases, labor disputes, strikes, and other factors. The introduction of new work
arrangements and company-specific requirements regarding when and how often employees are required to work on-site versus remotely may also impact
companies' ability to attract and retain employees. As companies increasingly allow employees to work remotely, traditional geographic competition for talent
may change in ways that we cannot predict. The departure of key individuals or our failure to maintain sufficient employee staffing levels could have a
material adverse impact on our business, as well as impede our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls and compliance with the
requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our
specifications.
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products. Our
products are manufactured to our specifications through arrangements with approximately 300 foreign manufacturers in various countries. In Fiscal 2025,
approximately 96% of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, with approximately
20% of our products sourced from Vietnam, 16% from Cambodia, and 12% from China. Risks inherent in importing our products include (i) the imposition of
additional tariffs, duties, taxes, and other charges on imports or exports, such as those recently announced by the U.S. as discussed below; (ii) changes in
diplomatic and trade relationships, including the imposition of any sanctions, restrictions, and other responses; (iii) the imposition of additional regulations,
quotas, trade sanctions, or safeguards relating to imports or exports, and costs of complying with such regulations and other laws relating to the identification
and reporting of the sources of raw materials used in our products, which could lead to the detention, exclusion, or seizure of goods and imposition of
monetary penalties and fines; (iv) adverse changes in local economic conditions, such as prolonged periods of recession, high inflation and/or interest rates, or
other factors described herein; (v) changes in social or political conditions, including those resulting from military conflicts, terrorist acts, or other hostilities,
that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are located; (vi) pandemic diseases, which could result
in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, port congestion, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas; (vii)
unfavorable changes in the availability, cost, or quality of raw materials and commodities; (viii) labor shortages within our supply chain resulting from labor
disputes, strikes, or otherwise; (ix) increases in the cost of labor or transportation; (x) disruptions of shipping and international trade caused by natural and
man-made disasters, severe weather, military conflicts, terrorist acts, or other hostilities (such as militant attacks on cargo vessels in the Red Sea), or other
unforeseen events, including any resulting impact to shipping prices and shipping times; (xi) heightened terrorism-related cargo and supply chain security
concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent, or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in the delivery of
cargo; and (xii) decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures, and
damage to the reputation of our brands.
As previously discussed, in April 2025, the U.S. announced significant changes to its trade policies, including a universal baseline tariff of 10% on all
U.S. imported goods, plus additional country-specific tariffs. In return, many countries have announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, resulting in
uncertainty of the future relationship between the U.S. and other countries, as well as the potential of an ensuing global trade war and recession. While the
U.S. implemented a 90-day pause on the majority of its proposed tariffs, we cannot predict at this time if and when any of the proposed tariffs will become
effective. As approximately 96% of our products are currently produced outside of the U.S., any material change in tariffs or other trade restrictions could
result in a significant increase to our product costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to offset
29


================================================================================
[PAGE 32 OF 144]
================================================================================
potential increased product costs through higher sales prices to our consumers, supply chain diversification, or other mitigating measures, which in turn could
have a material adverse effect on our business due to lower profitability.
In addition, the entire apparel industry, including our Company, has faced, and could continue to face, supply chain challenges as a result of
inflationary pressures, political instability, severe weather, military conflicts and other hostilities, pandemic diseases, and other factors, including reduced
freight availability, port congestion, labor shortages, and rising wages and energy costs, among other factors. The inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of
our products in a timely manner or to meet our strict quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items,
which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries, or a substantial reduction in purchase prices. We have also incurred, and may
continue to incur, higher freight and other logistic costs as a result of certain of the beforementioned factors. In addition, the cost and availability of raw
materials used to manufacture our products are subject to significant fluctuation as a result of certain of the beforementioned factors (including inflationary
pressures), as well as crop yields which could be negatively impacted by severe weather conditions. We may not be able to implement price increases that
fully offset increases in raw materials, freight, or other sourcing costs and/or any such price increases could have an adverse impact on consumer demand for
our products. Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our business could suffer if we need to replace manufacturers or distribution centers.
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products, the
majority of which are located in foreign countries. Accordingly, the success of our business depends on our ability to identify reputable manufacturers who
can fulfill our orders timely and to our specifications, as well as the timely importation, customs clearance, and shipment of products to and from our various
distribution centers. We compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers. Some of these competitors may place larger orders
than we do, and thus may have an advantage in securing production capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer
of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party manufacturing capacity. We cannot guarantee that this additional capacity will be available
when required on terms that are acceptable to us. We enter into purchase order commitments each season specifying a time for delivery, method of payment,
design and quality specifications, and other standard industry provisions, but do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturer. None of the
manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively.
In addition, we rely on a number of owned, leased, and independently-operated distribution facilities around the world to warehouse and ship products
to our customers and perform other related logistic services. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on the proper operation of these
distribution centers. Our distribution centers generally utilize computer-controlled and automated equipment, which are subject to various risks, including
software viruses, security breaches, power interruptions, or other system failures. If any of our distribution centers were to close or become inoperable or
inaccessible for any reason, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, severe weather, labor shortages, fires, and system failures, pandemic diseases, or if
we fail to successfully consolidate existing facilities or transition to new facilities, we could experience a substantial loss of inventory, disruption of deliveries
to our customers and our stores, increased costs, and longer lead times associated with the distribution of products during the period that would be required to
reopen or replace the facility. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We also rely upon third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution
centers, to our stores and shop-within-shops, and to our digital commerce and wholesale customers. Our utilization of these shipping services is subject to
various risks, including, but not limited to, potential labor shortages (stemming from labor disputes, strikes, or otherwise), severe weather, and pandemic
diseases, which could delay the timing of shipments, and increases in wages and fuel prices, which could result in higher transportation costs. The rapid
increase of online shopping driven by changes in consumer shopping preferences has amplified certain of these risks resulting in capacity constraints. We
have incurred, and may continue to incur, higher freight and other logistic costs as a result of certain of the beforementioned factors. Any delays in the timing
of our product shipments or increases in transportation costs could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate.
We face increasing competition from companies selling apparel, footwear, accessories, home, and other of our product categories, including through
the Internet. Although we sell our products through the Internet, increased competition and promotional activity in the worldwide apparel, footwear,
accessory, and home product industries from Internet-based competitors could reduce our sales, prices, and margins. We also face intense competition from
other domestic and foreign apparel, footwear, and accessory companies that sell products through brick and mortar stores and wholesale and licensing
channels. We compete with these companies primarily on the basis of: (i) anticipating and responding in a timely manner to changing consumer demands and
shopping preferences, including the ever-increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communications, and online and cross-channel shopping;
(ii) creating and maintaining favorable brand recognition,
30


================================================================================
[PAGE 33 OF 144]
================================================================================
loyalty, and a reputation for quality, including through digital brand engagement and online and social media presence; (iii) developing and producing
innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to consumers of varying demographics; (iv) competitively pricing our products and
creating a compelling value proposition for consumers; (v) providing strong and effective marketing support in several diverse demographic markets,
including through digital and social media platforms in order to stay better connected to consumers; (vi) establishing relationships with athletes, musicians,
influencers, and other celebrities to promote our brands and products; (vii) providing attractive, reliable, secure, and user-friendly digital commerce sites;
(viii) adapting to changes in technology, including the successful utilization of data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning; (ix) obtaining
sufficient and desirable retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at stores and shop-within-shops; (x) attracting consumer traffic to stores,
shop-within-shops, and digital commerce sites; (xi) sourcing sustainable and traceable raw materials at cost-effective prices; (xii) anticipating and maintaining
proper inventory levels; (xiii) ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain and distribution efficiencies with third-party manufacturers and
retailers; (xiv) maintaining and growing market share; (xv) recruiting and retaining talent to operate our retail stores, distribution centers, and various
corporate functions; (xvi) protecting our intellectual property; and (xvii) ability to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business
disruptions.
Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified and may have greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources, more
desirable store locations, and/or greater digital commerce presence than us, among other competitive advantages. Such competitive advantages may enable
them to better withstand unfavorable economic conditions, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production, and/or more quickly respond to
rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences than us. In addition, technological advances and the retail industry's low barriers to entry allow for
the introduction of new competitors and products at a rapid pace, which has been further compounded by the increasing shift to digital shopping channels.
Any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced market share or sales, which could
adversely affect our business.
The success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value and reputation of our brands.
Our success depends on the value and reputation of our brands and our ability to consistently anticipate, identify, and respond to customers' demands,
preferences, and fashion trends in the design, pricing, and production of our products, including the preference for certain products to be manufactured in the
U.S., and deliver high-quality and sustainable products supported by engaging marketing campaigns. Any negative publicity regarding Mr. R. Lauren, or
other members of our management team, or our Company as a whole, especially through social media which accelerates and increases the potential scope of
negative publicity, could adversely impact the image of our brands with our customers and result in diminished loyalty to our brands and potentially lead to
adverse consumer actions, including boycotts, even if the subject of such publicity is unverified or inaccurate and we seek to correct it. Consumer sentiment
can also be influenced by our partnership with athletes and other public figures, our relationships with wholesale customers, licensees, and suppliers, our
views on political and social issues, or our long-term initiatives and goals regarding our impact on the environment and society as a whole, among other
factors. Even if we react appropriately to negative publicity, our customers' perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted.
Any failure on our part to retain the value and reputation of brands could adversely impact our business.
Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the U.S.
Our trademarks, intellectual property, and other proprietary rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. We devote
substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities worldwide. However, significant counterfeiting
and imitation of our products continue to exist. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect trademarks or other proprietary rights to the
same extent as do the laws of the U.S. and, as a result, our intellectual property may be more vulnerable and difficult to protect in such countries. Over the
course of our international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or claimed ownership rights to some of our
key trademarks that include Polo and/or a representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise have contested our rights to our trademarks. We have
resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements. We cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to establish and
protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting, lost business, or brand dilution, any of which may have a
material adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to challenge brands imitating our products. Also, there can be
no assurance that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully
resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction or at all.
Our business is subject to risks related to leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases.
We generally operate most of our stores and corporate facilities under long-term, non-cancellable leasing arrangements. Our retail store leases typically
require us to make minimum rental payments, and often contingent rental payments based upon sales. In addition, our leases generally require us to pay our
proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance, and utilities. We generally cannot cancel our leases at our option. If we decide to close a
store, or if we decide to downsize,
31


================================================================================
[PAGE 34 OF 144]
================================================================================
consolidate, or relocate any of our corporate facilities, we may incur an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store or
corporate facility. In addition, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the remaining lease
term, even after the space is exited or otherwise closed and even if such closures are beyond our control (such as forced store closures resulting from
pandemic diseases). Such costs and obligations related to the early or temporary closure of our stores or termination of our leases could have a material
adverse effect on our business. In addition, certain of our leases include renewal options or terms that require rental payments to be adjusted to reflect current
fair market rental rates, which could be significantly higher than the prior term's rental payments. Further, as each of our leases naturally expires, we may be
unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could lead to store closures resulting in lost sales.
A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of large wholesale customers. Our business could be adversely affected as a
result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings, other ownership changes in the retail industry, and/or any financial instability of our large
wholesale customers.
Several of our department store customers, including some under common ownership, account for a significant portion of our wholesale net sales. A
substantial portion of sales of our licensed products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest department store customers. Sales to our
three largest wholesale customers accounted for approximately 12% of total net revenues for Fiscal 2025, and these customers accounted for approximately
25% of our total gross trade accounts receivable outstanding as of March 29, 2025. Approximately 70% of sales to our three largest wholesale customers
related to our North America segment and approximately 30% related to our Europe segment.
While we have long-standing relationships with the majority of our wholesale customers, we typically do not enter into long-term agreements with
them. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our product lines every season. A decision by the
controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by economic conditions, financial difficulties, competitive
conditions, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing
business with us or our licensing partners or a change based on their new strategic and operational initiatives, including their continued focus on further
development of "private labels" and exclusive product offerings in an effort to differentiate themselves from competitors, could have a material adverse effect
on our business.
The department store sector has experienced numerous consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies, and other ownership changes in recent times,
which could potentially increase in frequency as a result of current adverse economic conditions, including changes to existing trade policies and agreements
(including higher tariffs on U.S. imports), ongoing inflationary pressures and high interest rates, and/or changes in consumer shopping preferences, such as
the continued shift away from traditional brick and mortar wholesale retailers to larger online retailers. Such disruptions have typically resulted in actual or
anticipated bankruptcies (such as Hudson Bay Company's recent bankruptcy filing), store closures (such as Macy's previously announced plan to close 150
stores over a 3-year period through calendar 2026), centralized purchasing decisions, and increased emphasis on inventory management and productivity,
which could result in fewer stores carrying our products or reduced demand of our products by our wholesale customers. There can be no assurance that our
wholesale customers have adequate financial resources and/or access to additional capital to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions.
The loss of one or more significant wholesale customers, or the loss of a large number of smaller wholesale customers, could have a material adverse effect
on our business. Furthermore, the consolidation or other changes with respect to our wholesale customers could decrease our opportunities in the market,
increase our reliance on a smaller number of large wholesale customers, and/or decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale customers.
Certain of our large wholesale customers, particularly those located in the U.S., have been highly promotional and have aggressively marked down
their merchandise, including our products at times in the past. The continuation of such promotional activity could negatively impact our brand image and/or
lead to requests from those customers for increased end-of-season markdown allowances. In response and in connection with our growth plan, we
strategically reduce shipments to certain of our customers and exit less productive doors when deemed appropriate.
We sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners across North America,
Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, and extend credit based on an evaluation of each wholesale customer's financial condition, usually without
requiring collateral. However, the financial difficulties of a wholesale customer could cause us to limit or eliminate our business with that customer. We may
also assume more credit risk relating to that customer's receivables. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any one of these customers
could have a material adverse effect on our business. See Item 1 — "Business — Wholesale Credit Control."

================================================================================
[PAGE 35 OF 144]
================================================================================
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could restrict our ability to engage in additional capital-related transactions in the future.
As of March 29, 2025, our consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.1 billion, comprised of our outstanding unsecured senior notes. We also
maintain several credit and overdraft facilities, including our Global Credit Facility, which collectively had a remaining availability of approximately $805
million as of March 29, 2025. Accordingly, the amount of our indebtedness could further increase materially if we decide to draw upon our credit or overdraft
facilities. This substantial level of indebtedness could have adverse consequences to our business, including (i) making it more difficult to satisfy our debt
obligations as they become due; (ii) impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; (iii) requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows
from operations to be used for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash available to fund working
capital needs, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes; (iv) limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business; and (v)
increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.
We rely on our operating cash flows to repay our outstanding borrowings, as well as to fund any working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend
payments, share repurchases, and other general corporate purposes. Prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions in any of our
key regions, or a combination thereof, could impede our ability to pay our obligations as they become due or return value to our shareholders, as well as delay
previously planned expenditures related to our operations. Credit rating agencies also periodically review our capital structure and our ability to generate
earnings. A prolonged period of deteriorated financial performance or our inability to comply with debt covenants (as discussed below) could make future
financing more difficult to secure and/or expensive. Further, factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, could disrupt capital markets
and limit the availability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital to us in the future.
Certain of our debt instruments contain a number of affirmative and negative covenants, including maintaining a leverage ratio at or below a specified
level. Our failure to comply with such covenants or otherwise secure temporary waivers of non-compliance, could result in the termination of the related
facilities and/or our lenders demanding any amounts outstanding to be immediately repaid, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Further, even if we are able to obtain waivers of non-compliance, such waivers may result in incremental fees, higher interest rates, and/or additional
restrictions and covenants.
Additionally, interest rates have been at elevated levels in recent years and it is uncertain if and when such rates may decline. Higher interest rates may
increase the cost of any borrowings under our various credit and overdraft facilities, as well as negatively impact consumer sentiment and the global economy
as a whole, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business.
We rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses. Failure to maintain licensing partners could harm our business.
The risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks specific to a licensing
partner's business, including risks associated with a particular licensing partner's ability to (i) obtain capital; (ii) execute its business plans; (iii) manage its
labor relations; (iv) maintain relationships with its suppliers and customers; (v) generate sufficient cash flows to fund its operations and pay its obligations as
they become due, including minimum royalties due to us; (vi) withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions; (vii) manage its credit and
bankruptcy risks effectively; and (viii) protect the value and reputation of our brands.
Although a number of our license agreements prohibit our licensing partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our competitors, our
licensing partners generally are not precluded from offering, under other non-competitor brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements
with us. A substantial portion of sales of our products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest customers. While we have significant
control over our licensing partners' products and advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other things, operational and financial control over
their businesses. Changes in management, reduced sales of licensed products, poor execution, or financial difficulties with respect to any of our licensing
partners could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products.
Although we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners in most circumstances, if necessary, our inability to do so for any period of time
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

================================================================================
[PAGE 36 OF 144]
================================================================================
Our business could be adversely affected by man-made or natural disasters and other catastrophic events in the locations in which we or our
customers or suppliers operate.
Our operations, including retail, distribution, warehousing, and corporate operations, are susceptible to man-made or natural disasters, including severe
weather, geological events, pandemic diseases, and other catastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks and military conflicts, any of which could disrupt our
operations. In addition, the operations of our customers and suppliers could experience similar disruptions. The occurrence of natural disasters or other
catastrophic events may result in sudden disruptions in the business operations of the local and regional economies affected, as well as the global economy as
a whole, including, but not limited to, shortages and/or rising costs of raw materials or energy, public health issues, system failures, and reduced retail traffic.
The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect financial markets and the availability of capital. In addition, our business can be affected by
unseasonable weather conditions, such as extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures in the winter or unseasonably cold temperatures in the
summer. There is growing concern that climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters. Any
of these events could result in decreased demand for our products and disruptions in our sales channels and manufacturing and distribution networks, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Risks Related to Information Systems and Data Security
A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to litigation risk,
and adversely affect our business.
We are dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet, for a significant portion of our direct-to-consumer sales,
including our digital commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing (among other electronic payment methods
that we accept). We are also responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our digital
commerce sites and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy. In our normal course of business, we often
collect, transmit, and/or retain certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information. There is significant concern by
consumers, employees, and lawmakers alike over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft, and user privacy.
Cyber-criminals are constantly devising new, sophisticated schemes to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and confidential or sensitive data,
including through the use of artificial intelligence. Despite the security measures we currently have in place (including those described in Item 1C —
"Cybersecurity"), our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to targeted or random attacks that could lead to
security breaches, acts of vandalism, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, malware, ransomware, misplaced or lost data,
programming and/or human errors, or other Internet or email events. Further, our employees may intentionally or inadvertently cause data security breaches
that result in the unauthorized access or release of our private and sensitive information, the risk of which may be compounded as the use of artificial
intelligence becomes more prevalent. The extensive use of smartphones, tablets, and other wireless devices, as well as our hybrid work policy, under which a
substantial portion of our corporate employees work remotely for part of the work week, heighten these and other operational risks. Given the sensitive nature
of information collected and processed, the retail industry in particular continues to be the target of many cyber-attacks, which are becoming increasingly
more frequent and difficult to anticipate, prevent, and timely detect due to their rapidly evolving nature. Furthermore, economic sanctions issued by one
country against another or trade disputes could increase the risk of retaliatory state-sponsored cyber-attacks. Given the rapidly evolving nature, sophistication,
and complexity of cyber-attacks, despite our reasonable efforts to mitigate and prevent such attacks, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate,
prevent, timely detect, or implement effective preventive measures to protect against all cyber-attack incidents.
Although we have purchased network security and cyber liability insurance to provide a level of financial protection should a data breach occur, such
insurance may not cover us against all claims or costs associated with such a breach, and we cannot be certain that such insurance will continue to be
available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all, or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Additionally, the technology we
use to protect our systems from being breached or compromised could become outdated as a result of advances in computer capabilities or other technological
developments, thereby requiring us to make further investments in capital or other resources to protect us against cyber-attacks, the cost of which could be
significant. Further, measures we implement to protect our computer systems against cyber-attacks may make them harder to use or reduce the speed at which
they operate, which in turn could negatively impact our customers' shopping experience resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands,
and lost sales.
If unauthorized parties gain access to our networks or databases, or those of our vendors, they may be able to steal, publish, delete, modify, or block
our access to our private and sensitive internal and third-party information. Any perceived or actual electronic or physical security breach involving the
misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security,
whether by us or by a third
34


================================================================================
[PAGE 37 OF 144]
================================================================================
party, could disrupt our business, result in negative media attention, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees, or
vendors, expose us to risks of litigation, significant fines and penalties, liability, and higher costs for insurance or insurance not being available to us on
economically feasible terms or at all, and result in deterioration in our customers', employees', or vendors' confidence in us, and adversely affect our business,
results of operations, and financial condition. Since we do not control third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical
computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information
regarding our employees, customers, or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, result in lost sales, impair our ability to attract website
visitors, and/or reduce our ability to attract and retain employees and customers. As these threats develop and grow, we may find it necessary to make
significant further investments to protect data and our infrastructure, including the implementation of new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems,
deployment of additional personnel and protection-related technologies, engagement of third-party consultants, and training of employees.
In addition, the regulatory environment relating to information security and privacy is becoming increasingly more demanding with frequent new
requirements surrounding the handling, protection, and use of personal and sensitive information. We may incur significant costs in complying with the
various applicable state, federal, and foreign laws regarding protection of, and unauthorized disclosure of, personal information. Additionally, failing to
comply with such laws and regulations could damage the reputation of our brands and lead to adverse consumer actions, as well as expose us to government
enforcement action and/or private litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business.
Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.
We are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including designing, marketing,
manufacturing, importing, tracking, and distributing our products, processing payments, accounting for and reporting financial results, and managing our
employees and employee benefit programs. In addition, we have digital commerce and other informational websites in North America, Europe, and Asia, and
have plans for additional digital commerce sites in the future. Further, we utilize technology in the execution of our digital brand engagement and social
media communication initiatives. We have also implemented a hybrid work policy, allowing a substantial portion of our corporate employees to work
remotely for part of the work week. Given the complexity of our business and the significant number of transactions that we engage in on a daily basis, it is
imperative that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our computer hardware and software systems.
Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses,
technical malfunctions, inadequate system capacity, power outages, natural disasters, and usage errors by our employees or third-party consultants. If our
information technology systems become damaged or otherwise cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to repair or replace
them. Additionally, confidential or sensitive data related to our customers, employees, or vendors could be lost or compromised.
We are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems, software, and related processes. As described in Item 1 — "Business — Recent
Developments," we are in the early stages of executing a large-scale multi-year transformational project, which entails upgrading and enhancing our
technology infrastructure to better enable us to implement process changes to improve productivity and operational efficiencies on a global scale (the "Next
Generation Transformation project" or "NGT project"). A system project of this scope requires a significant investment in human and financial resources and
involves many risks and uncertainties, including failure to operate as designed, failure to properly integrate with other systems, potential loss of data or
information, cost overruns, and implementation delays. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, implementation, or transition of such systems
could also result in disruptions to our business operations, including the sourcing, sale, and shipment of our product, delays in the collection of cash from our
customers, diversion of management attention, and/or adversely affect our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner or otherwise
maintain compliance with internal controls. There is also no guarantee that we will realize the anticipated global synergies and benefits related to this project.
Any material disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Risks Related to Citizenship and Sustainability Issues
Our business could suffer if we fail to meet our global citizenship and sustainability goals or if such goals do not meet the expectations of our
stakeholders.
There is an increased focus from consumers, employees, investors, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders regarding environmental, social, and
governance ("ESG") matters. Furthermore, investors have placed increased importance on the social cost of their investments. We have established certain
long-term initiatives and goals regarding our impact on natural resources and society as a whole as part of our Global Citizenship & Sustainability strategy,
with the aim of future-proofing our business for years to come. However, there can be no assurance that our various stakeholders will agree with our
initiatives, or if we will be successful in achieving our goals by our targeted dates or at all. Further, we could incur additional costs, face market and
35


================================================================================
[PAGE 38 OF 144]
================================================================================
technological barriers, and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various citizenship and sustainability practices. Our failure, or
perceived failure, to achieve our goals could damage the reputation of our brands and lead to adverse consumer actions and/or investment decisions by
investors, as well as our ability to attract and retain employees.
Conversely, in recent years, negative sentiment towards corporate goals and initiatives related to these areas has gained momentum in the U.S., which
has been accompanied by the proposal or enactment of policies, legislation, or initiatives by several state legislatures and by the U.S. federal government
intended to prohibit or limit consideration of ESG matters by corporations and investors. Additionally, we could also be criticized by stakeholders who share
such sentiment for having certain initiatives and goals or for any revisions to such initiatives or goals. We may not be able to meet the increasingly diverging
expectations and perspectives on these topics and could be subjected to scrutiny that could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance
and growth.
Climate change, or our ability to adhere to any legislation and regulatory requirements related to climate change, traceability and transparency,
product labeling, or other sustainability matters may adversely affect our business.
Our business is susceptible to risks associated with climate change, including potential disruptions to our retail stores, distribution centers, and
corporate facilities or those facilities of our wholesale customers, licensees, logistics partners, and suppliers. Increased frequency and/or severity of extreme
weather events due to climate change could adversely impact global supply chains, including the availability, quality, and cost of raw materials (such as
cotton, a key raw material used in the production of our products that is highly susceptible to severe weather conditions), the ability of our manufacturers to
fulfill our orders timely and to our specifications, and shipping disruptions and/or higher freight costs. An increase in extreme weather conditions could also
result in more frequent damage and/or closures of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities, adversely impact retail traffic, consumer's
disposable income levels or spending habits on discretionary items, or otherwise disrupt business operations in the communities in which we operate, any of
which could result in lost sales or higher costs.
In addition, many countries in which we and our suppliers and wholesale customers operate have begun enacting new legislation and regulations
intended to reduce or mitigate the potential impacts of climate change, which could result in higher sourcing, operational, and compliance-related costs. Such
proposed measures also include expanded disclosure requirements regarding greenhouse gas emissions, climate change risks, and other climate-related
information, including independent auditors providing increasing levels of attestation to the accuracy of such disclosures. There has also been increased focus
by governmental and non-governmental organizations, consumers, customers, and other stakeholders on products that are made with more sustainable
practices and materials and other sustainability matters, including traceability and transparency, sustainability claims and product labeling requirements,
responsible sourcing and deforestation, design for circularity, the use of energy, water, and synthetic fibers, and the recyclability or recoverability of
packaging, product, and materials. It is becoming increasingly complex to monitor, assess, and ultimately comply with such new laws and regulations due to
the rapid speed at which such legislation is evolving, coupled with inconsistencies or contradictions between jurisdictions. Our ability to comply with any
such new laws and regulations or otherwise meet our various stakeholders' expectations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, including,
but not limited to, implementation of new information technology systems and the development of controls and processes surrounding the completeness and
accuracy of the data being reported. Any failure on our part to comply with such regulations or meet such expectations could lead to adverse investment
decisions by investors, lost sales resulting from our inability to sell our products in applicable jurisdictions and/or adverse consumer purchase decisions, as
well as expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation.
Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, and Tax Matters
Our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks.
Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain our current level of operations in our existing markets is subject to
certain risks associated with operating in various locations around the globe. These include, but are not limited to (i) complying with a variety of U.S. and
foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, trade, product labeling, and product safety restrictions, as well as forced labor regulations such as
the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act ("UFLPA") and the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act ("CAATSA"), both of which prohibit
the importation of goods made in whole or in part in certain territories, or by certain identified entities, and grants U.S. Customs & Border Protection the
authority to detain, exclude, or seize goods and assess monetary penalties and fines, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from
making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and similar foreign country laws, such as the U.K. Bribery
Act, which prohibits U.K. and related companies from any form of bribery; (ii) the imposition of additional duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges or other
barriers to trade; (iii) changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; (iv) general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets; (v) unexpected
changes in laws, judicial processes, or regulatory requirements; (vi) adapting to local customs and culture; (vii) civil and political instability, military
conflicts, terrorist attacks, and other hostilities; and (viii) pandemic diseases.
36


================================================================================
[PAGE 39 OF 144]
================================================================================
The future geopolitical landscape remains particularly uncertain. Any resulting changes in international trade relations, legislation and regulations
(including those related to tariffs, importation, and taxation), or economic and monetary policies, or heightened diplomatic tensions or political and civil
unrest, among other potential impacts (all as described within other risk factors herein), could adversely impact the global economy and our operating results.
Any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of any such changes could also adversely affect our business.
Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results.
We are subject to income and non-income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, with the applicable tax rates varying by jurisdiction.
We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any
given time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect
the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events
occur and exposures are evaluated. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the mix and
level of earnings by jurisdiction or by changes to existing accounting rules. Additionally, our products are subject to import and excise duties, and/or sales,
consumption, value-added taxes ("VAT"), and other non-income taxes in certain international jurisdictions. Failure to correctly calculate or submit the
appropriate amount of income or non-income taxes could subject us to substantial fines and penalties and adversely affect our business.
In addition, the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate may change, or there may be changes in interpretation and enforcement of
existing tax laws, which could materially affect our income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements. For example, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (the "OECD"), which represents a coalition of member countries, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax
principles through its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the creation of a global minimum tax rate of
15% commonly referred to as "Pillar Two." Although the U.S. effectively withdrew from the OECD global tax agreement in January 2025, other countries
where we conduct business, including Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Germany, have enacted similar legislation implementing Pillar Two rules (in
whole or in part), and additional countries could implement related legislation in the future. We cannot be certain if or when other countries will enact new
legislation or how closely any such new legislation will align with the OECD's Pillar Two framework. While we continue to evaluate the impact of these
legislative changes as new guidance becomes available, uncertainty remains regarding the timing and interpretation by tax authorities in affected jurisdictions.
Accordingly, although our business has not currently been materially impacted by those countries that have enacted Pillar Two rules to date, we cannot
guarantee that such impacts will remain immaterial to our business in the future. Furthermore, other taxing authorities of certain state, local, and other foreign
jurisdictions may also decide to modify existing tax laws. We cannot predict which, if any, of these items or others will be enacted into law or the resulting
impact any such enactment will have on our business operations, which could be material.
Our business could suffer if we fail to comply with labor laws or if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental practices.
We are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, and
citizenship requirements. Compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental
investigations or litigation. In addition, we require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and
regulations. We also require our manufacturers to make progress toward our citizenship and sustainability goals, including those related to the environment
and employee safety and well-being, among others. While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our employees
periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The violation
of any ethical, social, product safety, labor, health, environmental, privacy, or other standards and regulations by an independent manufacturer used by us or
one of our licensing partners, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us, subject us to litigation, and/or damage our
reputation. Any of these events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Certain legal proceedings, regulatory matters, and accounting changes could adversely affect our business.
We are involved in certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters and are subject from time to time to various claims involving alleged breach of
contract claims, intellectual property and other related claims, escheatment and unclaimed property, credit card fraud, security breaches in certain of our retail
store information systems, employment issues, consumer matters, lease disputes, and other litigation. Certain of these lawsuits and claims, if decided
adversely to us or settled by us, could result in material liability to our Company or have a negative impact on our reputation or relations with our employees,
customers, licensing partners, or other third parties. Other potential claimants may also be encouraged to bring suits against us based on a settlement from us
or adverse court decision against us for similar claims or allegations as their own. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory
proceedings, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require our
37


================================================================================
[PAGE 40 OF 144]
================================================================================
Company to devote substantial time and resources to defend itself. Further, changes in governmental regulations both in the U.S. and in other countries where
we conduct business operations could have an adverse impact on our business. See Item 3 — "Legal Proceedings" for further discussion of our Company's
legal matters.
In addition, we are subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other regulatory
agencies. If and when effective, such changes to accounting standards could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 to
the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain recently issued accounting standards.
Risks Related to our Common Stock
The trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance,
including our ability to return value to shareholders.
Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any
particular fiscal quarter. We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders. However, we also recognize that,
from time to time, it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our quarterly and annual forecast of net sales and earnings. While we generally
expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we do not have any responsibility to update any of our guidance or
other forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. In addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the
time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable. However, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and full fiscal year
expectations. Additionally, external analysts and investors may publish their own independent predictions of our future performance. We do not endorse such
predictions or assume any responsibility to correct such predictions when they differ from our own expectations. If, or when, we announce actual results that
differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside analysts, or others, the market price of our securities could be adversely affected. Investors who rely
on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered
as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities. Furthermore, the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations
that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies. Accordingly, public perception and other factors outside
of our control may impact our stock price, regardless of our actual operating performance.
In addition, we have historically returned value to shareholders through our payment of quarterly cash dividends and common stock share repurchases.
Investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends, further increase our cash dividend rate, and/or repurchase shares
available under our Class A common stock repurchase program. Our ability to pay quarterly cash dividends and repurchase our Class A common stock will
depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive,
and other factors that are beyond our control, such as impacts related to pandemic diseases, which in the past had resulted in us temporarily suspending our
quarterly cash dividend and share repurchases. Although both of these programs are currently active, our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, elect to
suspend or otherwise alter these programs at any time. The market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend payments and/or
Class A common stock share repurchase activity differ from investors' expectations.
Furthermore, stockholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, remains popular with many public investors. Due to
the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we may become the target of securities litigation or stockholder activism.
Responding to stockholder activist campaigns may result in increased costs and diversion of management's attention and resources.
The voting shares of our Company's stock are concentrated in one majority stockholder.
As of March 29, 2025, Mr. Ralph Lauren, or entities controlled by the Lauren family, held approximately 85% of the voting power of the outstanding
common stock of our Company. In addition, Mr. R. Lauren serves as our Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, Mr. R. Lauren's son, Mr. David
Lauren, serves as our Chief Branding and Innovation Officer, Strategic Advisor to the CEO, and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, and we employ
other members of the Lauren family. From time to time, we may have other business dealings with Mr. R. Lauren, members of the Lauren family, or entities
affiliated with Mr. R. Lauren or the Lauren family. As a result of his stock ownership and position in our Company, Mr. R. Lauren has the ability to exercise
significant control over our business, including, without limitation, (i) the election of our Class B common stock directors, voting separately as a class and (ii)
any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or
sales of all or substantially all of our assets.

Item 1C.    Cybersecurity.
Risk Management and Strategy
We have established a cybersecurity risk management program that is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management system and provides us
support in assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our enterprise risk management program is fully updated annually
and periodically updated and supplemented as new risks and opportunities are identified by management, including those related to cybersecurity risks. Our
longstanding information security risk program is structured according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework,
industry best practices, privacy legislation, and other global and local standards and regulations. This program includes a defense-in-depth approach with
multiple layers of security controls, including network segmentation, security monitoring, endpoint protection, and identity and access management, as well
as data protection best practices and data loss prevention controls.
Our cybersecurity awareness program includes regular phishing simulations, annual general cybersecurity awareness training, and data protection
modules, as well as more contextual and personalized modules for targeted users and roles. We incorporate external expertise and guidance in all aspects of
our cybersecurity program. We complete annual internal security audits and vulnerability assessments of the Company's information systems and related
controls, including systems affecting personal data. In addition, we leverage cybersecurity specialists to complete annual external audits and objective
assessments of our cybersecurity program and practices, including our data protection practices, as well as to conduct targeted attack simulations. We
continually enhance our information security capabilities in order to protect against emerging threats, while also increasing our ability to detect and respond to
cyber incidents and maximize our resilience to recover from potential cyber-attacks. We have a robust incident response plan in place that provides a
documented runbook for handling high severity cybersecurity incidents and facilitates coordination across various corporate functions. We also perform
simulations and drills at both a technical and leadership level at least annually. Additionally, we have purchased network security and cyber liability insurance
in order to provide a level of financial protection should a data breach occur.
Our cybersecurity framework incorporates a robust third-party information technology ("IT") risk management program to ensure our vendors meet
our high security standards. We leverage industry best practices like Standardized Information Gathering ("SIG") and recognized security certifications,
including SOC 2, ISO 27001, and PCI-DSS, to assess our vendors. We also conduct thorough penetration testing and require vendors to adopt appropriate
security controls through contractual agreements.
We thoroughly assess potential vendors based on their role and the sensitivity of the IT resources they access. Our vendors follow a consistent risk
management process in order to meet our high standards. We select vendors who prioritize data protection and comply with relevant privacy regulations.
Furthermore, we enforce strict protocols, including limiting access to necessary information, ensuring data usage is confined to agreed-upon purposes, and
mandating the deletion or return of data upon service termination. Through these measures, we collaborate with third-party vendors while implementing
controls to safeguard our information.
Our business strategy, results of operations, and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a
result of any previous cybersecurity incidents; however, we cannot assure that cybersecurity threats will not be material to us in the future. During the three
fiscal years presented within this Form 10-K, we have not experienced a known material information security breach nor incurred material breach-related
expenses. For a detailed discussion of significant risk factors regarding cybersecurity threats, see Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Information
Systems and Data Security."
Governance
Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing management's overall approach to risk management, including cybersecurity risk. In addition, the
Committees of the Board report to the full Board at regularly scheduled Board meetings on any identified material risks within that Committee's area of
responsibilities and oversight, as well as when new risks arise. The Audit Committee has responsibility for oversight of the Company's cybersecurity risks.
39


================================================================================
[PAGE 42 OF 144]
================================================================================
The Audit Committee reviews our cybersecurity program on a quarterly basis, including through review of a quarterly enterprise risk management
report, and periodically convenes special meetings to conduct deeper preparedness, enterprise risk and business continuity reviews. These special meetings
are open to the full Board to attend. In addition, the full Board periodically receives cybersecurity updates. Our Chief Information Officer ("CIO") and Chief
Information Security Officer ("CISO") attend all of these meetings and provide updates during them.
Our cybersecurity program is led by our CISO, a seasoned leader in the cybersecurity field with over 25 years of extensive experience across
cybersecurity, IT, risk management, and regulatory compliance. Holding both a master's in computer engineering and business administration, our CISO is
also a Certified Information Systems Security Professional ("CISSP"). Reporting directly to our CIO, the CISO leads a dedicated team of information security
and risk professionals. Together they are entrusted with the crucial task of managing our information security and data protection operations.
Collaborating closely with business stakeholders, our CISO shapes a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that serves as the cornerstone of our
information security programs, supporting effective cybersecurity risk management. Leading the cybersecurity risk assessment process, our CISO utilizes a
robust incident response plan to handle high-severity cybersecurity incidents promptly. In cases of potentially material cyberattack incidents, or a series of
smaller similar incidents, our CISO promptly engages a cross-functional incident response team to determine the materiality of the incident and whether
public disclosure is necessary.
The CISO informs our management leadership team on security matters and fosters a strong partnership with our corporate legal team to ensure
compliance with legal, regulatory, privacy, and contractual security requirements.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings.
We are involved, from time to time, in litigation, other legal claims, and proceedings involving matters associated with or incidental to our business,
including, among other things, matters involving credit card fraud, trademark and other intellectual property, licensing, importation and exportation of our
products, taxation, unclaimed property, leases, and employee relations. We believe at present that the resolution of currently pending matters will not
individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, our assessment of any current litigation or
other legal claims could potentially change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known or determinations by judges, juries, or other finders of fact
which are not in accord with management's evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or claims.

OVERVIEW
Our Business
Our Company is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of luxury lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear & accessories,
home, fragrances, and hospitality. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products, brands,
distribution channels, and international markets. Our brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Double RL,
Polo Ralph Lauren, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, and Chaps, among others.
We diversify our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and
licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or
channel of distribution. We sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-
shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-
party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which we have licensed the right to operate in defined geographic
territories using our trademarks. In addition, we license to third parties for specified periods the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the
licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel categories, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.

================================================================================
[PAGE 47 OF 144]
================================================================================
We organize our business into the following three reportable segments:
•
North America — Our North America segment, representing approximately 43% of our Fiscal 2025 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of
our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses primarily in the U.S. and Canada. In North America, our
retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our outlet stores, and our digital commerce sites, www.RalphLauren.com and
www.RalphLauren.ca. Our wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department stores and, to a lesser extent,
specialty stores.
•
Europe — Our Europe segment, representing approximately 31% of our Fiscal 2025 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph
Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Europe and emerging markets. In Europe, our retail business is
primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our outlet stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce
sites. Our wholesale business in Europe is comprised primarily of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores,
depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital and licensee partners.
•
Asia — Our Asia segment, representing approximately 24% of our Fiscal 2025 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren
branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Our retail business in Asia is primarily
comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our outlet stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites. In
addition, we sell our products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. Our wholesale business in Asia is comprised
primarily of sales to department stores and various third-party digital and licensee partners.
No operating segments were aggregated to form our reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable
segments, representing approximately 2% of our Fiscal 2025 net revenues, which primarily consist of Ralph Lauren and Chaps branded royalty revenues
earned through our global licensing alliances.
Approximately 57% of our Fiscal 2025  net revenues were earned outside of the U.S. See Note 20 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.
Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale sales
in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods
impacting our retail business and timing of seasonal wholesale shipments. As a result of changes in our business, consumer spending patterns, and the
macroeconomic environment, including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events, historical quarterly operating trends and
working capital requirements may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating income (loss), and cash flows in
any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns.
Recent Developments
Next Generation Transformation Project
We are in the early stages of executing a large-scale, multi-year global project that is expected to significantly transform the way in which we operate
our business and further enable our long-term strategic pivot towards a global direct-to-consumer-oriented model (the "Next Generation Transformation
project" or "NGT project"). The NGT project will be completed in phases and involves the redesigning of certain end-to-end processes and the
implementation of a suite of technology systems on a global scale. Such efforts are expected to result in significant process improvements and the creation of
synergies across core areas of operations, including merchandise buying and planning, procurement, inventory management, retail and wholesale operations,
and financial planning and reporting, better enabling us to optimize inventory levels and increase the speed with which we react to changes in consumer
demand across markets, among other benefits.
In connection with the preliminary phase of the NGT project, we incurred other charges of $25.2 million and $5.1 million during Fiscal 2025 and
Fiscal 2024, respectively, which were recorded within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

================================================================================
Global Economic Conditions and Industry Trends
The global economy and retail industry are impacted by many uncontrollable factors. Most recently, the U.S. announced significant changes to its trade
policies, including widespread tariff increases on imported goods, with potential further increases and revisions or terminations to existing trade agreements.
In response, many countries have announced or are otherwise considering retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports and other trade restrictions. This has led to
significant uncertainty regarding the future relationship between the U.S. and other countries, as well as growing concerns about a global trade war, higher
inflation, and a potential global recession, which has already caused significant volatility of global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rates.
Other recent economic conditions, including ongoing inflationary pressures, organized labor disputes, high interest rates, significant foreign currency
volatility, and military conflicts (as discussed below), continue to impact consumer discretionary income levels, spending, and sentiment in the U.S. and
beyond. In response to such pressures, as well as to reduce elevated inventory levels, many retailers (particularly in the U.S.) continue to resort to promotional
activity in an attempt to offset traffic declines and increase conversion. Furthermore, the department store sector has also experienced consolidations,
restructurings, bankruptcies, and other ownership changes in recent times, as well as an increase in store closures.
The global economy has also been negatively impacted by ongoing military conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, militant
attacks on cargo vessels in the Red Sea, and other hostilities in the Middle East. Although our voluntary decision to suspend operations in Russia has not
resulted in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements and our ongoing operations in Israel are also not material, our business has been, and
may continue to be, affected by the broader macroeconomic implications resulting from these and other military conflicts, including inflationary pressures,
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, increases in energy prices, food shortages, and financial market volatility, among other factors, which have
adversely impacted consumer sentiment and confidence. It is not clear at this time how long these conflicts will endure, or if they will escalate further with
additional countries declaring war against each other, which could further amplify the impacts of the various macroeconomic factors described above and
potentially result in a global recession.
The global supply chain has also been negatively impacted by various factors, including disruptions at U.S. ports and in the Red Sea. Although our
business has not been significantly impacted by such disruptions, we have experienced some shipping delays impacting the timing of inventory receipts, and
if such disruptions were to continue over a prolonged period, it could result in further inventory receipt delays and/or higher freight costs in the near-term and
beyond.
We have implemented various global strategies to address many of these challenges and continue to build a foundation for long-term profitable growth
by strengthening our consumer-facing areas and driving a more efficient operating model. We continue to monitor the current geopolitical landscape,
including the potential impact of higher tariffs should they become effective. We have taken proactive measures in recent years to diversify our supply chain
from a geographic perspective and believe we can further mitigate potential cost pressures associated with new tariffs through a combination of our
disciplined inventory management, leveraging our relationships with suppliers to reduce product costs, our ability to change country of origin, and pricing
actions. However, should the proposed tariffs become effective, our profitability will be negatively impacted. Regarding mitigating inflationary pressures, our
strategy includes numerous levers, including our ability to effectively increase prices, leveraging our diversified supply chain and strong supplier
relationships, and leveraging our in-house quality control to reduce time and cost from the manufacturing process, among other efforts. Despite the
competitive environment, we plan to continue driving our broader long-term strategy of brand elevation, which includes multiple levers to continue driving
average unit retail growth and brand equity.
We will continue to monitor these conditions and trends and adjust our operating strategies to help mitigate the related impacts on our results of
operations, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business and protecting and elevating the value of our brand.
For a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see Part
I, Item 1A — "Risk Factors" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Summary of Financial Performance
Operating Results
In Fiscal 2025, we reported net revenues of $7.079 billion, net income of $742.9 million, and net income per diluted share of $11.61, as compared to
net revenues of $6.631 billion, net income of $646.3 million, and net income per diluted share of $9.71 in Fiscal 2024. The comparability of our operating
results has been affected by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits), as well as foreign currency volatility.
Our operating results are also susceptible to changes in macroeconomic conditions.
Our operating performance for Fiscal 2025 reflected revenue increases of 6.8% on a reported basis and 7.7% on a constant currency basis, as defined
within "Transactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" below. Net revenues reflected growth across all
of our reportable segments.
Our gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased by 180 basis points to 68.6% during Fiscal 2025, primarily driven by the favorable
geographic, channel, and product mix, average unit retail ("AUR") growth, and lower cotton costs, more than offsetting incremental pressure from non-cotton
product costs and unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased by 30 basis points to 54.6% during Fiscal 2025,
largely attributable to geographic and channel mix, as well as increases across various expense categories, including higher compensation-related expenses
and higher marketing investments due to planned key campaign events.
Net income increased by $96.6 million to $742.9 million in Fiscal 2025 as compared to Fiscal 2024, primarily due to a $175.7 million increase in our
operating income, partially offset by a $76.7 million increase in our income tax provision. Net income per diluted share increased by $1.90 to $11.61 per
share during Fiscal 2025 driven by the higher level of net income and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.
During Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, our operating results were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and
certain other charges (benefits) totaling $57.8 million and $69.9 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $46.0 million,
or $0.72 per diluted share, and $52.6 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, respectively. Net income during Fiscal 2024 also reflected an income tax benefit of
$13.1 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, recorded in connection with non-recurring income tax events.
Financial Condition and Liquidity
We ended Fiscal 2025 in a net cash and short-term investments position (calculated as cash and cash equivalents, plus short-term investments, less total
debt) of $940.4 million, as compared to $642.7 million as of the end of Fiscal 2024. The increase in our net cash and short-term investments position during
Fiscal 2025 as compared to Fiscal 2024 was primarily due to our operating cash flows of $1.235 billion, partially offset by our use of cash to support Class A
common stock repurchases of $480.9 million, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards, to invest in our
business through $216.2 million in capital expenditures, and to make dividend payments of $201.1 million.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.235 billion during Fiscal 2025, as compared to $1.070 billion during Fiscal 2024. The net increase in
cash provided by operating activities was due to an increase in net income before non-cash charges, as well as a net favorable change related to our operating
assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year.
Our equity increased to $2.589 billion as of March 29, 2025, compared to $2.450 billion as of March 30, 2024 due to our comprehensive income and
the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements, partially offset by our share repurchase activity and dividends declared during Fiscal 2025.

Transactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition
The comparability of our operating results for the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by certain events, including:
•
pretax charges incurred in connection with our restructuring activities, as well as certain other benefits (charges) as summarized below
(references to "Notes" are to the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements):

Non-routine inventory benefits (charges) are recorded within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. The benefits
recorded during Fiscal 2024 primarily related to reversals of amounts previously recognized in connection with delays in U.S. customs
shipment reviews and approvals (approximately $3 million) and the COVID-19 pandemic (approximately $2 million). Non-routine
inventory charges, net recorded during Fiscal 2023 primarily related to the Russia-Ukraine war (approximately $10 million) and delays in
U.S. customs shipment reviews and approvals (approximately $5 million).
Non-routine bad debt expense reversals are recorded within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Non-routine bad
debt reversals, net recorded during Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 primarily related to charges previously recognized in connection with the
Russia-Ukraine war.
•
a one-time tax benefit of $13.1 million recorded within our income tax provision during Fiscal 2024 in connection with Swiss tax reform and the
European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, which decreased our Fiscal 2024 effective tax rate by 170 basis points. See Note 10 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Because we are a global company, the comparability of our operating results reported in U.S. Dollars is also affected by foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which we transact change in value over time compared to the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations can have a
significant effect on our reported results. As such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP"), our discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating current-year and prior-
year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. We present constant currency financial information,
which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to our reported operating results. We use constant currency information to provide a
framework for assessing how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe this information is
useful to investors for facilitating comparisons of operating results and better identifying trends in our businesses. The constant currency performance
measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Reconciliations between this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included in the "Results of
Operations" section where applicable.
Our discussion also includes reference to comparable store sales. Comparable store sales refer to the change in sales of our stores that have been open
for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales from our digital commerce sites are also included within comparable sales for those geographies that have been
serviced by the related site for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales for stores or digital commerce sites that are closed or shut down during the year are
excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of
25% or greater), or generally closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until
such stores have been operating in their new location or in their newly renovated state for at least 13 full fiscal months. All comparable store sales metrics are
calculated on a 52-week and constant currency basis.
Our "Results of Operations" discussion that follows includes the significant changes in operating results arising from these items affecting
comparability. However, unusual items or transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and other financial statement users should consider
the types of events and transactions that have affected operating trends.

across all of our reportable segments, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of $66.1 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues
increased by $513.7 million, or 7.7%.

North America net revenues — Net revenues increased by $99.6 million, or 3.4%, during Fiscal 2025 as compared to Fiscal 2024. On a constant
currency basis, net revenues increased by $103.9 million, or 3.5%.
The $99.6 million increase in North America net revenues was driven by:
•
a $118.5 million increase related to our North America retail business. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $121.9 million,
reflecting increases of $114.3 million in comparable store sales and $7.6 million in non-comparable store sales. The increase in our comparable
store sales reflected high-single digit AUR growth during Fiscal 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as higher traffic. The

[PAGE 53 OF 144]
================================================================================
This increase was partially offset by an $18.9 million decline related to our North America wholesale business primarily driven by reduced excess
inventory sales in the off-price wholesale channel.
Europe net revenues — Net revenues increased by $206.9 million, or 10.5%, during Fiscal 2025 as compared to Fiscal 2024. On a constant currency
basis, net revenues increased by $220.1 million, or 11.2%.
The $206.9 million increase in Europe net revenues was driven by:
•
a $132.8 million increase related to our Europe retail business, inclusive of unfavorable foreign currency effects of $6.2 million. On a constant
currency basis, net revenues increased by $139.0 million, reflecting increases of $132.8 million in comparable store sales and $6.2 million in
non-comparable store sales. The increase in our comparable store sales reflected low-double digit AUR growth during Fiscal 2025 as compared
to the prior fiscal year, as well as higher traffic. The following table summarizes the percentage changes in comparable store sales related to our
Europe retail business:

•
a $74.1 million increase related to our Europe wholesale business largely driven by stronger re-order trends more than offsetting planned
reductions within the off-price wholesale channel and unfavorable foreign currency effects of $7.0 million.
Asia net revenues — Net revenues increased by $142.8 million, or 9.1%, during Fiscal 2025 as compared to Fiscal 2024. On a constant currency basis,
net revenues increased by $191.3 million, or 12.2%.
The $142.8 million increase in Asia net revenues was driven by:
•
a $167.8 million increase related to our Asia retail business, inclusive of unfavorable foreign currency effects of $46.6 million. On a constant
currency basis, net revenues increased by $214.4 million, reflecting increases of $151.4 million in comparable store sales and $63.0 million in
non-comparable store sales. The increase in our comparable store sales reflected low-double digit AUR growth during Fiscal 2025 as compared

This increase was partially offset by a $25.0 million decline related to our Asia wholesale business, largely driven by decreases in South Korea and
Japan.
Gross Profit.    Gross profit increased by $421.1 million, or 9.5%, to $4.853 billion in Fiscal 2025, including unfavorable foreign currency effects of
$62.8 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 68.6% in Fiscal 2025 from 66.8% in Fiscal 2024. The 180 basis point improvement
was primarily driven by the favorable impact of approximately 70 basis points attributable to geographic and channel mix. The remaining 110 basis point
improvement was primarily due to AUR growth of approximately high-single digits, lower cotton costs, and favorable product mix, more than offsetting
incremental pressure from non-cotton products costs and unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 20 basis points.
Gross profit is the difference between total net revenues and cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes the amounts incurred to acquire and
produce inventory for sale to our customers, including product costs, freight-in, and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory
realizability. Gains and losses associated with forward foreign currency exchange contracts that are designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of
inventory transactions are also recognized within cost of goods sold when the hedged inventory is sold. The costs of selling merchandise, including those
associated with preparing merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing, and order charges, are included in SG&A expenses in the
consolidated statements of operations. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.    SG&A expenses include costs relating to compensation and benefits, marketing and advertising, rent
and occupancy, distribution, information technology, legal, depreciation and amortization, bad debt, and other selling and administrative costs. SG&A
expenses increased by $262.5 million, or 7.3%, to $3.863 billion in Fiscal 2025, including favorable foreign currency effects of $30.8 million. SG&A
expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 54.6% in Fiscal 2025 from 54.3% in Fiscal 2024. The 30 basis point increase was largely attributable to
geographic and channel mix resulting from growth of our international and retail businesses which typically carry higher operating expense margins, as well
as increases across various expense categories, including higher compensation-related expenses and marketing investments due to planned key campaign
events.
The $262.5 million increase in SG&A expenses was driven by:

Impairment of Assets.    During Fiscal 2025, we recorded impairment charges of $0.8 million to write-down long-lived assets in connection with certain
North America wholesale shops that are expected to close earlier than the end of their original estimated useful life due to the related customer declaring
bankruptcy. On a comparative basis, no impairment charges were recorded during Fiscal 2024. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.
Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.   During Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, we recorded net restructuring charges of $20.4 million and $55.8 million,
respectively, primarily consisting of severance and benefits costs, as well as other charges of $11.4 million and $14.0 million, respectively, primarily related
to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations in connection with our restructuring activities for which the related
lease agreements have not yet expired. In addition, during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, we recorded other charges of $25.2  million and $5.1  million,
respectively, in connection with our Next Generation Transformation project (refer to "Recent Developments" for additional discussion) and recorded other
income of $2.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively, related to consideration received from Regent, L.P. in connection with our previously sold Club
Monaco business. We donated this income to The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, a non-profit, charitable foundation, which resulted in related offsetting
donation expenses of $2.8 million and $7.0 million during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.
Operating Income.    Operating income increased by $175.7 million, or 23.2%, to $932.1 million during Fiscal 2025, reflecting unfavorable foreign
currency effects of $32.0 million. Our operating results during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges,
impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $57.8 million and $69.9 million, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of net
revenues was 13.2% in Fiscal 2025, reflecting a 180 basis point improvement from Fiscal 2024. The improvement in operating income as a percentage of net
revenues was primarily driven by the increase in our gross margin, as well as lower net restructuring-related charges and certain other charges (benefits)
recorded during Fiscal 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by the increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, all as
previously discussed.

North America operating margin improved by 240 basis points due to an increase of 230 basis points in gross margin and a decline of 10 basis points
in SG&A expense as a percentage of net revenues. The overall improvement in operating margin was inclusive of the unfavorable impact of approximately 10
basis points attributable to channel mix.
Europe operating margin improved by 240 basis points entirely due to an increase in gross margin. The overall improvement in operating margin was
inclusive of the unfavorable impacts of approximately 30 basis points and 20 basis points related to foreign currency effects and channel mix, respectively.
Asia operating margin improved by 280 basis points due to a decline of 190 basis points in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues and an
increase of 80 basis points in gross margin. The overall improvement in operating margin was inclusive of the unfavorable impacts of approximately 50 basis
points and 20 basis points related to foreign currency effects and channel mix, respectively.
Corporate expenses increased by $108.4 million to $755.4 million in Fiscal 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in corporate
expenses was due to higher compensation-related expenses of $50.7 million, higher non-income taxes of $23.9 million, higher marketing and advertising
expenses of $13.5 million, lower intercompany sourcing commission of $9.3 million (which is offset at the segment level and eliminates in consolidation),
lower non-routine inventory benefits of $4.5 million, and higher other expenses of $22.8 million, partially offset by lower rent and occupancy expenses of
$16.3 million.
Non-operating Income (Expense), Net.    Non-operating income (expense), net is comprised of interest expense, interest income, and other income
(expense), net, which includes foreign currency gains (losses), equity in income (losses) from our equity-method investees, and other non-operating expenses.
During Fiscal 2025, we reported non-operating income, net, of $18.6 million as compared to $21.0 million during Fiscal 2024. The $2.4 million decrease in
non-operating income, net was primarily driven by higher interest expense.
Income Tax Provision.    The income tax provision represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate will change from
period to period based on various factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted
tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies.

================================================================================
The income tax provision and effective tax rate in Fiscal 2025 were $207.8 million and 21.9%, respectively, compared to $131.1 million and 16.9%,
respectively, in Fiscal 2024. The $76.7 million increase in our income tax provision was primarily driven by an increase in our pretax income, as well as a 500
basis point increase in our effective tax rate. The increase in our effective tax rate was due to the absence of prior year favorable adjustments related to the
accrual of deferred tax assets in connection with a transaction entered into as part of a reorganization of our corporate entity structure, and revaluation of
deferred tax assets as a result of tax rate changes enacted in the prior year period, partially offset by a current year favorable adjustment related to the
revaluation of a deferred tax liability on foreign earnings. The increase in our effective tax rate was also due to the absence of a one-time tax benefit of $13.1
million recorded during Fiscal 2024 in connection with Swiss tax reform and the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, which lowered our prior
fiscal year period effective tax rate by 170 basis points. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Net Income.    Net income increased to $742.9 million in Fiscal 2025, from $646.3 million in Fiscal 2024. The $96.6 million increase in net income
was primarily due to an increase in our operating income, partially offset by an increase in our income tax provision, both as previously discussed. Our
operating results during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other
charges (benefits) totaling $57.8 million and $69.9 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $46.0 million and $52.6
million, respectively. Net income during Fiscal 2024 also reflected an income tax benefit of $13.1 million recorded in connection with Swiss tax reform and
the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, as previously discussed.
Net Income per Diluted Share.    Net income per diluted share increased to $11.61 in Fiscal 2025, from $9.71 in Fiscal 2024. The $1.90 per share
increase was primarily driven by the higher level of net income, as previously discussed, and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during Fiscal
2025 driven by our share repurchases during the last twelve months. Net income per diluted share for Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 were also negatively
impacted by $0.72 per share and $0.80 per share, respectively, attributable to net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges
(benefits), as previously discussed. Net income per diluted share during Fiscal 2024 was also favorably impacted by $0.20 due to an income tax benefit
recorded in connection with Swiss tax reform and the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, as previously discussed.

North America net revenues — Net revenues decreased by $70.0 million, or 2.3%, during Fiscal 2024 as compared to Fiscal 2023. On a constant
currency basis, net revenues decreased by $67.8 million, or 2.2%.
The $70.0 million decline in North America net revenues was driven by:
•
a $113.3 million decline related to our North America wholesale business as we carefully managed sell-ins to our wholesale customers to better
align with consumer demand, as well as the return to a more normalized timing of shipments following the prior year's supply chain disruption.
This decline was partially offset by:
•
a $43.3 million increase related to our North America retail business. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $44.3 million,
reflecting increases of $35.9 million in comparable store sales and $8.4 million in non-comparable store sales. The increase in our comparable
store sales reflected high-single digit AUR growth during Fiscal 2024 as compared to Fiscal 2023, as well as higher traffic. The following table
summarizes the percentage changes in comparable store sales related to our North America retail business:

Europe net revenues — Net revenues increased by $128.8 million, or 7.0%, during Fiscal 2024 as compared to Fiscal 2023. On a constant currency
basis, net revenues increased by $59.2 million, or 3.2%.
The $128.8 million increase in Europe net revenues was driven by:
•
a $112.9 million increase related to our Europe retail business, inclusive of favorable foreign currency effects of $31.4 million. On a constant
currency basis, net revenues increased by $81.5 million, reflecting increases of $66.7 million in comparable store sales and $14.8 million in non-
comparable store sales. The increase in our comparable store sales reflected low-teens AUR growth during Fiscal 2024 as compared to Fiscal
2023, as well as higher traffic. The following table summarizes the percentage changes in comparable store sales related to our Europe retail
business:

a $15.9 million increase related to our Europe wholesale business largely driven by favorable foreign currency effects of $38.2 million and
stronger re-order trends, more than offsetting the negative impact of lapping the prior fiscal year's favorable post-pandemic wholesale
allowances.
Asia net revenues — Net revenues increased by $139.9 million, or 9.8%, during Fiscal 2024 as compared to Fiscal 2023. On a constant currency basis,
net revenues increased by $194.9 million, or 13.7%.
The $139.9 million increase in Asia net revenues was driven by:
•
a $141.7 million increase related to our Asia retail business, inclusive of unfavorable foreign currency effects of $51.5 million. On a constant
currency basis, net revenues increased by $193.2 million, reflecting increases of $116.9 million in comparable store sales and $76.3 million in
non-comparable store sales. The increase in our comparable store sales reflected low-teens AUR growth during Fiscal 2024 as compared to

Gross Profit.    Gross profit increased by $266.0 million, or 6.4%, to $4.432 billion in Fiscal 2024, including unfavorable foreign currency effects of
$4.9 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 66.8% in Fiscal 2024 from 64.6% in Fiscal 2023. The 220 basis point improvement
was primarily driven by the favorable impacts of approximately 90 basis points attributable to geographic and channel mix and 30 basis points attributable to
lower non-routine inventory charges recorded during Fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The remaining 100 basis point improvement was
primarily due to lower freight costs and AUR growth of approximately low-double digits, more than offsetting incremental pressure from higher cotton costs
and unfavorable foreign currency effects of 20 basis points.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.    SG&A expenses increased by $191.6 million, or 5.6%, to $3.600 billion in Fiscal 2024, including
favorable foreign currency effects of $11.4 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 54.3% in Fiscal 2024 from 52.9% in Fiscal
2023. The 140 basis point increase was largely attributable to geographic and channel mix resulting from growth of our international and retail businesses
which typically carry higher operating expense margins.

Impairment of Assets.      No impairment charges were recorded during Fiscal 2024. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2023, we recorded
impairment charges of $9.7 million to write-down certain long-lived assets, primarily related to a certain previously exited real estate location for which the
related lease agreement had not yet expired. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.   During Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, we recorded net restructuring charges and benefits of $55.8 million and
$19.2 million, respectively, primarily consisting of severance and benefits costs, as well as other charges of $14.0 million and $23.8 million, respectively,
primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations in connection with our restructuring activities for
which the related lease agreements had not yet expired. In addition, during Fiscal 2024 we recorded other charges of $5.1 million in connection with our Next
Generation Transformation project (refer to "Recent Developments" for additional discussion). Additionally, during Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, we
recognized income of $7.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively, related to consideration received from Regent, L.P. in connection with our previously sold
Club Monaco business. We donated this income to The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, which resulted in related offsetting donation expenses of $7.0
million and $3.5 million during Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, respectively. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Operating Income.        Operating income increased by $52.2 million, or 7.4%, to $756.4 million during Fiscal 2024, reflecting favorable foreign
currency effects of $6.5 million. Our operating results during Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges,
impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $69.9 million and $66.0 million, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of net
revenues was 11.4% in Fiscal 2024, reflecting a 50 basis point improvement from Fiscal 2023. The improvement in operating income as a percentage of net
revenues was primarily driven by the increase in our gross margin, partially offset by the increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, both as
previously discussed.

North America operating margin declined by 10 basis points due to an increase of 240 basis points in SG&A expense as a percentage of net revenues,
more than offsetting an increase of 230 basis points in gross margin. The overall decline in operating margin was inclusive of the unfavorable impact of
approximately 30 basis points attributable to channel mix.
Europe operating margin improved by 150 basis points due to an increase of 240 basis points in gross margin, more than offsetting an increase of 90
basis points in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues. The overall improvement in operating margin was inclusive of favorable foreign currency
effects of 20 basis points and the unfavorable impact of 40 basis points related to channel mix.
Asia operating margin improved by 110 basis points due to decline of 140 basis points in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, more than
offsetting a decline in gross margin of 20 basis points. The overall improvement in operating margin was inclusive of unfavorable foreign currency effects of
20 basis points.
Corporate expenses decreased by $4.5 million to $647.0 million in Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023. The decrease in corporate expenses was due
to lower non-routine inventory charges recorded during Fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year of $19.9 million, lower rent and occupancy expenses
of $6.6 million, lower marketing and advertising expenses of $6.4 million, lower depreciation and amortization expenses of $5.6 million, lower consulting
fees of $5.1 million, lower selling-related expenses of $4.6 million, and lower other expenses of $6.8 million, partially offset by higher compensation-related
expenses of $50.5 million.
Non-operating Income (Expense), Net.    During Fiscal 2024, we reported non-operating income, net, of $21.0 million as compared to non-operating
expense, net of $12.3 million during Fiscal 2023. The $33.3 million increase in non-operating income, net was mainly due to a $40.8 million increase in
interest income driven by higher interest rates in financial markets and higher average on-hand cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balance
during Fiscal 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in interest income was partially offset by higher interest expense and other expense, net.

Income Tax Provision.    The income tax provision and effective tax rate in Fiscal 2024 were $131.1 million and 16.9%, respectively, compared to
$169.2 million and 24.5%, respectively, in Fiscal 2023. The $38.1 million decrease in our income tax provision was primarily driven by the 760 basis point
decline in our effective tax rate, partially offset by an increase in our pretax income. The decline in our effective tax rate was due to a deferred tax benefit
recognized as a result of transactions entered into as part of a reorganization of the Company's legal entity structure, the favorable impact of remeasuring net
deferred tax assets as a result of changes enacted in tax legislation, and the absence of unfavorable prior year adjustments related to certain deferred tax assets
and receivables, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of audit-related reserve adjustments. The decline in our effective tax rate was also due to a one-
time tax benefit of $13.1 million recorded during Fiscal 2024 in connection with Swiss tax reform and the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive,
which lowered our effective tax rate by 170 basis points. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Net Income.    Net income increased to $646.3 million in Fiscal 2024, from $522.7 million in Fiscal 2023. The $123.6 million increase in net income
was primarily due to an increase in our operating income and non-operating income, net, as well as a decrease in our income tax provision, all as previously
discussed. Our operating results during Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and
certain other charges (benefits) totaling $69.9 million and $66.0 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $52.6 million
and $52.9 million, respectively. Net income during Fiscal 2024 also reflected an income tax benefit of $13.1 million recorded in connection with Swiss tax
reform and the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, as previously discussed.
Net Income per Diluted Share.    Net income per diluted share increased to $9.71 in Fiscal 2024, from $7.58 in Fiscal 2023. The $2.13 per share
increase was primarily driven by the higher level of net income, as previously discussed, and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during Fiscal
2024 driven by our share repurchases during the preceding twelve months. Net income per diluted share for Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 were also negatively
impacted by $0.80 per share and $0.76 per share, respectively, attributable to net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges
(benefits), as previously discussed. Net income per diluted share during Fiscal 2024 was also favorably impacted by $0.20 due to an income tax benefit
recorded in connection with Swiss tax reform and the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, as previously discussed.

See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the carrying values of our debt.
The increase in our net cash and short-term investments position at March 29, 2025 as compared to March 30, 2024 was primarily due to our operating
cash flows of $1.235 billion, partially offset by our use of cash to support Class A common stock repurchases of $480.9 million, including withholdings in
satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards, to invest in our business through $216.2 million in capital expenditures, and to make
dividend payments of $201.1 million.
The increase in our equity was attributable to our comprehensive income and the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements, partially offset
by our share repurchase activity and dividends declared during Fiscal 2025.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.    Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.235 billion during Fiscal 2025, as compared to $1.070
billion during Fiscal 2024. The $165.4 million net increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to an increase in net income before non-cash
charges, as well as a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year.
The net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, was primarily driven by:
•
a favorable change in our accounts payable driven by the timing of cash payments, as well as a net favorable change in accrued liabilities largely
driven by accrued payroll and benefits resulting from anticipated higher bonus achievement levels, partially offset by our restructuring reserve
due to a decrease in restructuring charges recorded during the current fiscal year period as compared to the prior fiscal year period.

================================================================================
This increase related to our operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by:
•
an unfavorable change in inventory driven by higher in-transit inventory, as well as higher product and freight costs.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.    Net cash used in investing activities was $264.1 million during Fiscal 2025, as compared to $256.8 million
during Fiscal 2024. The $7.3 million net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by:
•
a $51.4 million increase in capital expenditures. During Fiscal 2025, we spent $216.2 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $164.8
million during Fiscal 2024. Our capital expenditures during Fiscal 2025 primarily related to store openings and renovations, enhancements to
our information technology systems, and corporate office renovations.
This increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by:
•
a $41.0 million decrease in purchases of investments, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. During Fiscal 2025, we made net
investment purchases of $47.5 million, as compared to $88.5 million during Fiscal 2024.
In Fiscal 2026, we expect to spend approximately 4% to 5% of net revenues on capital expenditures, primarily related to the purchase of real estate,
store openings and renovations, enhancements to our information technology systems (including those related to our Next Generation Transformation
project), and a continuation of our corporate office renovations.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.    Net cash used in financing activities was $704.0 million during Fiscal 2025, as compared to $665.6 million
during Fiscal 2024. The $38.4 million net increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by:
•
a $31.2 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. During Fiscal 2025, we used $424.5 million to
repurchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $56.4 million in shares of
our Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our
long-term stock incentive plans. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2024, we used $398.2 million to repurchase shares of our Class A
common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $51.5 million in shares of our Class A common stock were
surrendered or withheld for taxes.

================================================================================
[PAGE 65 OF 144]
================================================================================
The net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, was primarily driven by:
•
a favorable change related to our inventories, largely driven by a more normalized receipt cadence;
•
a net favorable change in our accrued liabilities largely driven by the impact of a lower bonus achievement level realized during Fiscal 2023 as
compared to the prior fiscal year and a favorable change in our restructuring reserve due to an increase in restructuring charges recorded during
Fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as a favorable change in accounts payable driven by the timing of cash payments; and
•
a favorable change related to our accounts receivable, largely driven by a decline in wholesale net revenues and timing of cash receipts.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities.    Net cash used in investing activities was $256.8 million during Fiscal 2024, as compared to net
cash provided by investing activities of $471.5 million during Fiscal 2023. The $728.3 million net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily
driven by:
•
a $783.3 million decrease in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, less purchases of investments. During Fiscal 2024, we made net
investment purchases of $88.5 million, as compared to receiving net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $694.8 million during
Fiscal 2023.
This increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by:
•
a $52.7 million decrease in capital expenditures. During Fiscal 2024, we spent $164.8 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $217.5
million during Fiscal 2023. Our capital expenditures during Fiscal 2024 primarily related to store openings and renovations, as well as
enhancements to our information technology systems.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.    Net cash used in financing activities was $665.6 million during Fiscal 2024, as compared to $1.209 billion
during Fiscal 2023. The $543.2 million net decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by:
•
a $500.0 million decrease in cash used to repay debt. During Fiscal 2024, we did not issue or repay any debt. On a comparative basis, during
Fiscal 2023, we repaid our previously outstanding $500.0 million principal amount of unsecured 1.700% senior notes that matured on June 15,
2022; and
•
a $38.9 million decrease in cash used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. During Fiscal 2024, we used $398.2 million to
repurchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $51.5 million in shares of
our Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our
long-term stock incentive plans. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2023, we used $454.3 million to repurchase shares of our Class A
common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $34.3 million in shares of our Class A common stock were
surrendered or withheld for taxes.
Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations, our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments,
availability under our credit and overdraft facilities and commercial paper program, and other available financing options. We also maintain access to the
capital markets and may issue debt securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity and/or funds to refinance existing debt.
During Fiscal 2025, we generated $1.235 billion of net cash flows from our operations. As of March 29, 2025, we had $2.083 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, of which $1.398 billion were held by our subsidiaries domiciled outside the U.S. We are not dependent on foreign
cash to fund our domestic operations. Undistributed foreign earnings generated on or before December 31, 2017 that were subject to the one-time mandatory
transition tax in connection with U.S. tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") are not considered to be permanently
reinvested and may be repatriated to the U.S. in the future with minimal or no additional U.S. taxation. We intend to permanently reinvest undistributed
foreign earnings generated after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time
63

================================================================================
mandatory transition tax. However, if our plans change and we choose to repatriate post-2017 earnings to the U.S. in the future, we would be subject to
applicable U.S. and foreign taxes.

As defined in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Global Credit Facility. Accordingly, we do not expect combined
borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Global Credit Facility to exceed $750 million.
Represents outstanding letters of credit for which we were contingently liable under the Global Credit Facility as of March 29, 2025.
We believe that the Global Credit Facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentration in any one financial institution. In particular, as of
March  29, 2025, there were seven financial institutions participating in the Global Credit Facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum
commitment percentage in excess of 20%. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we have the ability to expand our borrowing availability under the
Global Credit Facility to $1.500 billion through the full term of the facility, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility
to increase their commitments.
Borrowings under the Pan-Asia Credit Facilities and Japan Overdraft Facility (collectively, the "Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities") are guaranteed by the
parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the participating banks (as described within Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements), subject to availability of the respective banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. We have no reason to believe that the
participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the Global Credit Facility and the Pan-
Asia Borrowing Facilities in the event of our election to draw additional funds in the foreseeable future.
Our sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, global retail store and digital
commerce expansion, construction and renovation of shop-within-shops, investment in infrastructure, including technology, payment of dividends, debt
repayments, Class A common stock repurchases, settlement of contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions), and other corporate activities,
including our restructuring actions. We believe that our existing sources of cash, the availability under our credit facilities, and our ability to access capital
markets will be sufficient to support our operating, capital, and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, the ongoing development of our
businesses, and our plans for further business expansion. However, prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions in any of our
key regions, or a combination thereof, such as those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events, could impede our ability to pay our
obligations as they become due or return value to our shareholders, as well as delay previously planned expenditures related to our operations.
See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our credit facilities.
Supplier Finance Program
We support a voluntary supplier finance program which provides certain of our inventory suppliers the opportunity, at their sole discretion, to sell their
receivables due from us (which are generally due within 90 days) to a participating financial institution in exchange for receipt of a discounted payment
amount made earlier than the payment term stipulated between us and the supplier. Our vendor payment terms and amounts due are not impacted by a
supplier's decision to participate in the program. We have not pledged any assets and do not provide guarantees under the supplier finance program. Our

obligations outstanding under our supplier finance program were $181.0 million and $129.2 million as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, respectively,
and were recorded within accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for
additional information relating to our supplier finance program.
Debt and Covenant Compliance
In August 2018, we completed a registered public debt offering and issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due
September 15, 2025, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.750%, payable semi-annually (the "3.750% Senior Notes"). In June 2020, we completed another
registered public debt offering and issued an additional $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes that were due and repaid on June
15, 2022 with cash on hand, which bore interest at a fixed rate of 1.700%, payable semi-annually (the "1.700% Senior Notes"), and $750 million aggregate
principal amount of unsecured senior notes due June 15, 2030, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.950%, payable semi-annually (the "2.950% Senior
Notes").
The indenture and supplemental indentures governing the 3.750% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes (as supplemented, the "Indenture") contain
certain covenants that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge
with another party; or sell, lease, or convey all or substantially all of our property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does not contain any
financial covenants.
We have a credit facility that provides for a $750 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit through June 30, 2028, which may be used for
working capital needs, capital expenditures, certain investments, general corporate purposes, and for funding of acquisitions, as well as used to support the
issuance of letters of credit and the maintenance of the Commercial Paper Program (the "Global Credit Facility"). Borrowings under the Global Credit
Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and certain other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and Japanese Yen. We have the ability to
expand the borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $1.500 billion, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the
facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility.
The Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants, as described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of
March 29, 2025, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility) has occurred under our Global Credit Facility. The Pan-
Asia Borrowing Facilities do not contain any financial covenants.
See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our debt and covenant compliance.
Common Stock Repurchase Program
As of March 29, 2025, the remaining availability under our Class A common stock repurchase program was approximately $352 million. On May 15,
2025, our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our existing common stock repurchase program that allows us to repurchase up to an additional
$1.500 billion of our Class A common stock, excluding related excise taxes. Repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock are subject to overall
business and market conditions.
See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our Class A common stock repurchase
program.
Dividends
We have generally maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on our common stock since 2003.
On May 16, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.75 to $0.825 per share.
On May 15, 2025, our Board of Directors approved an additional increase to the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.825 to $0.9125 per
share. The first quarterly dividend to reflect this increase is expected to be payable to shareholders of record at close of business on June 27, 2025 and paid on
July 11, 2025.
We intend to continue to pay regular dividends on outstanding shares of our common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the
future will ultimately be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition,
and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, including economic and market conditions.

The following is a description of our material, firmly committed obligations as of March 29, 2025:
•
Senior Notes represent the principal amount of our outstanding 3.750% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes. Amounts do not include any call
premiums, unamortized debt issuance costs, or interest payments (see below);
•
Interest payments on debt represent the semi-annual contractual interest payments due on our 3.750% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes.
Amounts do not include the impact of potential cash flows underlying our related swap contracts (see Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements for discussion of our swap contracts);
•
Lease obligations represent fixed payments due over the lease term of our noncancelable leases of real estate and operating equipment,
including rent, real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance fees, and/or certain other costs. For lease terms that have commenced,
information has been presented separately for operating and finance leases. Other lease commitments relate to executed lease agreements for
which the related lease terms have not yet commenced as of March 29, 2025;
•
Inventory purchase commitments represent our legally-binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable
prices;
•
Mandatory transition tax payments represent our remaining tax obligation incurred in connection with the deemed repatriation of previously
deferred foreign earnings pursuant to the TCJA (see Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the TCJA);
•
Real estate purchase commitment relates to our legally-binding agreement to purchase real estate located in New York City; and
•
Other commitments primarily represent our legally-binding obligations related to sponsorship, licensing, and other marketing and advertising
agreements; information technology-related service agreements; and pension-related obligations.

================================================================================
Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $193.3 million as of March 29, 2025,
as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. The above table also excludes the following: (i) amounts
recorded in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of March 29, 2025, which will be paid within one year, other than lease obligations,
mandatory transition tax payments, and accrued interest payments on debt; and (ii) non-current liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them
(e.g., deferred income), or the cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do not represent a "purchase obligation" as such term is used herein (e.g.,
deferred taxes, derivative financial instruments, asset retirement obligations, and other miscellaneous items).
We also have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments if certain events or circumstances occur. See Note 15 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our contingent commitments not included in the above table.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In addition to the commitments included in the above table, our other off-balance sheet firm commitments relating to our outstanding letters of credit
amounted to $10.6 million as of March  29, 2025. We do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations, or other
relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements.
MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
As discussed in Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we are exposed to a variety of levels and types of risks, including the
impact of changes in currency exchange rates on foreign currency-denominated balances, certain anticipated cash flows of our international operations, and
the value of reported net assets of our foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations relating to fluctuations in
benchmark interest rates. Accordingly, in the normal course of business we assess such risks and, in accordance with our established policies and procedures,
may use derivative financial instruments to manage and mitigate them. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Given our use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual
obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, it is our policy to only enter into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon an
evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. Our established policies and procedures for
mitigating credit risk include ongoing review and assessment of the creditworthiness of our counterparties. We also enter into master netting arrangements
with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. As a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to undue
concentration of counterparty risk with respect to our derivative contracts as of March  29, 2025. However, we do have in aggregate $25.9 million of
derivative instruments in net asset positions held across three creditworthy financial institutions.
Foreign Currency Risk Management
We manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates using forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts.
Refer to Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the notional amounts and fair values of our outstanding forward
foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts, as well as the impact on earnings and other comprehensive income of such instruments for the
fiscal years presented.
Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts
We use forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's
non-functional currency, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net assets into U.S.
Dollars. As part of our overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the
South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi, we generally hedge a
portion of our related exposures anticipated over the next twelve months using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with maturities of two months to
one year to provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure.
Our foreign exchange risk management activities are governed by established policies and procedures. These policies and procedures provide a
framework that allows for the management of currency exposures while ensuring the activities are conducted within our established guidelines. Our policies
include guidelines for the organizational structure of our risk management function and for internal controls over foreign exchange risk management
activities, including, but not limited to,
67


================================================================================
[PAGE 70 OF 144]
================================================================================
authorization levels, transaction limits, and credit quality controls, as well as various measurements for monitoring compliance. We monitor foreign exchange
risk using different techniques, including periodic review of market values and performance of sensitivity analyses.
Cross-Currency Swap Contracts
We periodically designate pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contracts as hedges of our net investment in certain European
subsidiaries. These contracts swap U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed interest rate payments based on the contract's notional amount and the fixed rate of interest
payable on certain of our senior notes for Euro-denominated fixed interest rate payments, thereby economically converting a portion of our fixed-rate U.S.
Dollar-denominated senior note obligations to fixed rate Euro-denominated obligations.
See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our foreign currency exposures and the types of derivative
instruments used to hedge those exposures.
Sensitivity
We perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our forward foreign currency
exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. In doing so, we assess the risk of loss in the fair values of these contracts that would result from hypothetical
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by the foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. Dollar.
As of March 29, 2025, a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies under contract would result in a net increase or
decrease, respectively, in the fair value of our derivative portfolio of approximately $121 million. This hypothetical net change in fair value should ultimately
be largely offset by the net change in the related underlying hedged items.
Interest Rate Risk Management
Sensitivity
As of March 29, 2025, we had no variable-rate debt outstanding. As such, our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily relates to changes in the
fair values of our fixed-rate Senior Notes. As of March 29, 2025, the aggregate fair values of our Senior Notes were $1.089 billion. A 25-basis point increase
or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase, respectively, the aggregate fair values of our Senior Notes by approximately $9 million based on
certain simplifying assumptions, including an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes
for the remainder of the period. Such potential increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt would only be realized if we were to retire all or a portion of
the debt prior to its maturity.
Investment Risk Management
As of March 29, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents on-hand of $1.922 billion, consisting of deposits in interest bearing accounts, investments in
money market deposit accounts, and investments in time deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less. Our other significant investments included
$160.5 million of short-term investments, consisting of time deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days.
We actively monitor our exposure to changes in the fair value of our global investment portfolio in accordance with our established policies and
procedures, which include monitoring both general and issuer-specific economic conditions, as discussed in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. Our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit
risk, and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy. See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for further detail of the composition of our investment portfolio as of March 29, 2025.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and requires
significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, assessments of
probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other
professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts.
We believe that the
68


================================================================================
[PAGE 71 OF 144]
================================================================================
following list represents our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting
policies, see Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Sales Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts
A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue involves estimating sales reserves, which represent the portion of gross revenues not
expected to be realized. In particular, gross revenue related to our wholesale business is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns,
operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances. Gross revenue related to our retail business, including digital commerce sales, is also
reduced by an estimate of returns.
In developing estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and cooperative advertising allowances, we analyze
historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, current economic and market conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms.
Estimates for operational chargebacks are based on actual customer notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and historical trends. We review and refine
these estimates on a quarterly basis. Our historical estimates of these amounts have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse
future economic and market conditions, such as those resulting from widespread pandemic diseases and/or other catastrophic events, could result in our actual
results differing materially from our estimates. A hypothetical 1% increase in our reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational
chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances as of March 29, 2025 would have reduced our Fiscal 2025 net revenues by approximately $1
million.
Similarly, we evaluate our accounts receivable balances to develop expectations regarding the extent to which they will ultimately be collected.
Significant judgment and estimation are involved in this evaluation, including a receivables aging analysis which shows, by aged category, the percentage of
receivables that has historically gone uncollected, an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts (including consideration of
their financial condition and ability to withstand potential prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions), and an evaluation of current and forecasted
economic and market conditions over the respective asset's contractual life. Based on this information, we record an allowance for estimated amounts that we
ultimately expect not to collect due to credit. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for these risks as part of our allowance for doubtful
accounts, a severe and prolonged adverse impact on our major customers' business and operations beyond those forecasted could have a corresponding
material adverse effect on our net revenues, cash flows, and/or financial condition. A hypothetical 1% increase in the level of our allowance for doubtful
accounts as of March 29, 2025 would have increased our Fiscal 2025 SG&A expenses by less than $1 million.
See "Accounts Receivable" in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our sales reserves and
allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal years presented.
Inventories
We hold retail inventory that is sold in our own stores and digital commerce sites directly to consumers. We also hold inventory that is sold through
wholesale distribution channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores. Substantially all of our inventories are comprised of finished goods,
which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted-average cost basis.
The estimated net realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual product lines, the impact
of market trends and economic conditions (including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events), and a forecast of future demand,
giving consideration to the value of current orders in-house for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell inventory through our outlet stores, among
other liquidation channels. Actual results may differ from estimates due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer
preferences, and economic and market conditions. Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on
historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. Our historical estimates of these costs and the related provisions have not
differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions could result in our actual results differing
materially from our estimates.
A hypothetical 1% increase in the level of our inventory reserves as of March  29, 2025 would have decreased our Fiscal 2025 gross profit by
approximately $3 million.

================================================================================
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with
other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be
fully recoverable.
We generally perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. However, in order to reassess the fair values of our reporting units, we periodically
perform a quantitative impairment analysis in lieu of using the qualitative approach.
Performance of the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment requires judgment in identifying and considering the significance of relevant key
factors, events, and circumstances that affect the fair values of our reporting units. This requires consideration and assessment of external factors such as
macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as our actual and planned financial performance. We also give
consideration to the difference between each reporting unit's fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date that a fair value measurement was
performed. If the results of the qualitative assessment conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying
value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed.
The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair
value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not to be impaired. However, if the carrying value of a
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Any impairment charge recognized is limited to the
amount of the respective reporting unit's allocated goodwill.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires judgment and often involves the use of
significant estimates and assumptions, including an assessment of external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-
specific factors, such as actual and planned financial performance. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used when determining the fair values of other
indefinite-lived intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and
the magnitude of any such charge. To assist management in the process of determining any potential goodwill impairment, we may review and consider
appraisals from accredited independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons,
and recent transactions. These approaches involve significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount
rates reflecting the risks inherent in those future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, and selection of appropriate market comparable metrics and transactions.
We performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2025 using the qualitative approach
discussed above. In performing the assessment, we considered the results of our most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test, which was performed as
of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, the results of which indicated that the fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their
respective carrying values. Based on the results of the qualitative impairment assessment, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values
of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment. No goodwill impairment charges
were recorded during any of the fiscal years presented. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
In evaluating finite-lived intangible assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition where probable. If such estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an
impairment loss is recognized to the extent that such asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, as estimated considering external market participant
assumptions.
It is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for
example, (i) our businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in future years vary from current assumptions, (iii) business
conditions or strategies change from our current assumptions, or (iv) the identification of our reporting units change, among other factors. Such changes could
result in a future impairment charge of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

Property and equipment and lease-related right-of-use ("ROU") assets, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets for
recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (including any potential sublease income for lease-
related ROU assets) and its eventual disposition, where applicable. If such estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than
its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that such asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, as estimated considering external
market participant assumptions and discounted cash flows, including those based on estimated market rents for lease-related ROU assets. Assets to be
disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal (commonly referred to as assets held-for-sale) are reported at the lower of carrying value or
fair value, less costs to sell.
In determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost
controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local
advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, future impairments may arise in the event that future cash
flows do not meet expectations. For example, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions could negatively impact consumer behavior,
spending levels, and/or shopping preferences and result in actual results differing from our estimates. Additionally, we may review and consider appraisals
from accredited independent valuation firms to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, where applicable.
During Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2023, we recorded impairment charges of $0.8 million and $9.7 million, respectively, to write-down the carrying values
of certain long-lived assets based upon their assumed fair values. No impairment charges were recorded during Fiscal 2024. See Note 8 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Income Taxes
In determining our income tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If we believe that a tax
position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the tax benefit. We measure
the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is
examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and require significant
judgment, and we often obtain assistance from external advisors. To the extent that our estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different
from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. If the initial
assessment of a position fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we will recognize the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case
law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) the statute of limitations expires; or
(iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency.
Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating losses, capital losses, general business credit carryforwards, and the net tax effects
of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted
tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax
asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, which typically
involves the use of significant estimates. Such allowances are adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances.
See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes.
Contingencies
We are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including potential losses relating to certain
litigation, alleged information system security breaches, contractual disputes, employee relation matters, various tax or other governmental audits, and
trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a
loss has been incurred and the amount of such loss is reasonably estimable. In addition, if it is considered reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement
of a contingency could exceed any established liability, we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, if
practicable. Management considers many factors in making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these
assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties,
and governmental actions. As a
71

================================================================================
result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on management's judgment in developing the related estimates and assumptions.
Stock-Based Compensation
We expense all stock-based compensation awarded to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the
requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures which are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and expected future trends.
Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")
We grant service-based RSUs to certain of our senior executives and other employees, as well as to our non-employee directors. In addition, we grant
RSUs with performance-based and market-based vesting conditions to such senior executives and other key employees.
The fair values of our service-based RSU and performance-based RSU awards are measured based on the fair value of our Class A common stock on
the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and
unvested. Related compensation expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized over the employees' requisite service period, to the extent that our
attainment of performance goals (upon which vesting is dependent) is deemed probable, and involves judgment as to expectations surrounding our
achievement of certain defined operating performance metrics.
The fair value of our market-based RSU awards, for which vesting is dependent upon total shareholder return ("TSR") of our Class A common stock
over a three-year performance period relative to that of a pre-established peer group, is measured on the grant date based on estimated projections of our
relative TSR over the performance period. These estimates are made using a Monte Carlo simulation, which models multiple stock price paths of our Class A
common stock and that of the peer group to evaluate and determine our ultimate expected relative TSR performance ranking. Related compensation expense,
net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied. See Note 18 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Sensitivity
The assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair values of our stock-based compensation awards represent our best estimates. In addition,
projecting the achievement level of certain performance-based awards, as well as estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited, requires
judgment. If actual results or forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions, or if assumptions used to estimate the grant date fair value of
future stock-based award grants are significantly changed, stock-based compensation expense and, therefore, our results of operations could be materially
impacted. A hypothetical 10% change in our Fiscal 2025 stock-based compensation expense would have affected our net income by approximately $9
million.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued accounting standards which have
impacted our consolidated financial statements, or may impact our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.
Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, see "Market Risk Management" in Item 7 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
See the "Index to Consolidated Financial Statements" appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

================================================================================
Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures.
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it
files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers,
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end
of the fiscal year covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level, as of the fiscal year-end covered by this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.
(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Securities Exchange Act
Rule  13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Internal control over financial
reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company's assets
are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Company's assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be
prevented or detected. Further, the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as of a specific date, and continued
effectiveness in future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance
with the policies and procedures may decline.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report based on the framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on
this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal controls over financial reporting were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the
fiscal year-end covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control
over financial reporting as included elsewhere herein.
(c) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2025 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B.    Other Information.
Trading Arrangements
During the three months ended March 29, 2025, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange
Act) adopted or terminated "Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements" or "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements" (each term as defined in Item 408 of Regulation
S-K of the Securities Exchange Act).

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.    Description of Business
Ralph Lauren Corporation ("RLC") is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of luxury lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear
& accessories, home, fragrances, and hospitality. RLC's long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products,
brands, distribution channels, and international markets. RLC's brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren Purple Label,
Double RL, Polo Ralph Lauren, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, and Chaps, among others. RLC and its subsidiaries are collectively
referred to herein as the "Company," "we," "us," "our," and "ourselves," unless the context indicates otherwise.
The Company diversifies its business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail,
wholesale, and licensing). This allows the Company to maintain a dynamic balance as its operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any
single geographic area or channel of distribution. The Company sells directly to consumers through its integrated retail channel, which includes its retail
stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. The Company's wholesale sales are made principally to
major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which the
Company has licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using its trademarks. In addition, the Company licenses to third parties for
specified periods the right to access its various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain
apparel categories, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.
The Company organizes its business into the following three reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to these reportable
segments, the Company also has other non-reportable segments. See Note 20 for further discussion of the Company's segment reporting structure.
2.    Basis of Presentation
Basis of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP")
and present the consolidated financial position, income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows of the Company, including all entities in which
the Company has a controlling financial interest and is determined to be the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
Fiscal Year
The Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. As such, fiscal year 2025 ended on March 29, 2025 and
was a 52-week period ("Fiscal 2025"); fiscal year 2024 ended on March 30, 2024 and was a 52-week period ("Fiscal 2024"); fiscal year 2023 ended on
April 1, 2023 and was a 52-week period ("Fiscal 2023"); and fiscal year 2026 will end on March 28, 2026 and will be a 52-week period ("Fiscal 2026").
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and notes thereto. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include reserves for customer bad debt, customer returns,
discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances; the realizability of inventory; reserves for
litigation and other contingencies; useful lives and impairments of long-lived tangible and intangible assets; fair value measurements; accounting for income
taxes and related uncertain tax positions; valuation of stock-based compensation awards and related forfeiture rates; and reserves for restructuring activity,
among others.

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods' financial information in order to conform to the current period's presentation.
3.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue across all channels of the business when it satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of promised
products or services to its customers, which occurs either at a point in time or over time, depending on when the customer obtains the ability to direct the use
of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services. The amount of revenue recognized considers terms of sale that create
variability in the amount of consideration that the Company ultimately expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products or services, and is subject to an
overall constraint that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. Sales and other related taxes collected from customers and remitted to
government authorities are excluded from revenue.
Revenue from the Company's retail business is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of the products, which occurs either at the
point of sale for merchandise purchased at the Company's own retail stores and shop-within-shop locations, or upon receipt of shipment for merchandise
ordered through direct-to-consumer digital commerce sites. Such revenues are recorded net of estimated returns based on historical trends. Payment is due at
the point of sale.
Gift cards purchased by customers are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed for products sold by the Company's retail business, at which point
revenue is recognized. The Company also estimates and recognizes revenue for gift card balances not expected to ever be redeemed (referred to as
"breakage") to the extent that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or
abandoned property. Such estimates are based upon historical redemption trends, with breakage income recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual
customer redemptions.
Revenue from the Company's wholesale business is generally recognized upon shipment of products, at which point title passes and risk of loss is
transferred to the customer. In certain arrangements where the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment, revenue is recognized upon receipt of
products by the customer. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and
certain cooperative advertising allowances. Returns and allowances require pre-approval from management and discounts are based on trade terms. Estimates
for end-of-season markdown reserves are based on historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic and market
conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms. Estimates for operational chargebacks are based on actual customer notifications of
order fulfillment discrepancies and historical trends. The Company reviews and refines these estimates on at least a quarterly basis. The Company's historical
estimates of these amounts have not differed materially from actual results.
Revenue from the Company's licensing arrangements is recognized over time during the period that licensees are provided access to the Company's
trademarks (i.e., symbolic intellectual property) and benefit from such access through their own sales of licensed products. These arrangements require
licensees to pay a sales-based royalty, which for most arrangements, may be subject to a contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Payments are
generally due quarterly and, depending on time of receipt, may be recorded as a liability until recognized as revenue. The Company recognizes revenue for
sales-based royalty arrangements (including those for which the royalty exceeds any contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount) as licensed products
are sold by the licensee. If a sales-based royalty is not ultimately expected to exceed a contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount, the minimum is
generally recognized as revenue ratably over the respective contractual period. This sales-based output measure of progress and pattern of recognition best
represents the value transferred to the licensee over the term of the arrangement, as well as the amount of consideration that the Company is entitled to receive
in exchange for providing access to its trademarks.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Net revenues from the Company's retail and wholesale businesses are recognized at a point in time. Net revenues from the Company's licensing
business are recognized over time.
Deferred Income
Deferred income represents cash payments received in advance of the Company's transfer of control of products or services to its customers and
generally consists of unredeemed gift cards (net of breakage) and advance royalty payments from its licensees. The Company's deferred income balances
were $16.7 million and $17.4 million as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, respectively, and were primarily recorded within accrued expenses and other
current liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. The majority of the deferred income balance as of March 29, 2025 is expected to be recognized as
revenue within the next twelve months.

Cost of goods sold includes the amounts incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale to the Company's customers, including product costs,
freight-in, and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability. Gains and losses associated with forward foreign
currency exchange contracts that are designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of inventory transactions are also recognized within cost of goods sold
when the hedged inventory is sold. The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated with preparing merchandise for sale, such as picking,
packing, warehousing, and order charges ("handling costs"), are included in selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Costs associated with shipping goods to customers are accounted for as fulfillment activities and reflected as SG&A expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations. Shipping and handling costs (described above) billed to customers are included in revenue. A summary of shipping and handling
costs recognized during the fiscal years presented is as follows:

Marketing and Advertising Costs
Advertising costs, including the costs to produce advertising, are expensed when the advertisement is first exhibited. Advertising costs paid to
wholesale customers under cooperative advertising programs are not included in advertising costs, but rather are reflected as a reduction of revenue since
generally the benefits are not sufficiently separable from the purchases of the Company's products by customers. Costs associated with the marketing and
promotion of the Company's products are included within SG&A expenses.
Marketing and advertising expenses were $516.3 million, $467.0 million, and $438.1 million in Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively.
Deferred marketing and advertising costs, which principally relate to advertisements that have not yet been exhibited or payments made for services that have
not yet been received, were $21.7 million and $19.6 million at the end of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively, and were recorded within prepaid
expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
The financial position and operating results of the Company's foreign operations are accounted for in their respective functional currencies, which are
generally consistent with the local currency. For purposes of consolidation, local currency assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. Dollars at the spot rates
of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. Dollars at average rates of exchange in
effect during the period. The

resulting translation gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a component of other comprehensive income
(loss) ("OCI") and in the consolidated statements of equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"). Gains and losses on the
translation of intercompany loans made to foreign subsidiaries that are of a long-term investment nature are also included within this component of equity.
The Company also recognizes gains and losses on both third-party and intercompany balances that are denominated in a currency other than the
respective entity's functional currency. Such foreign currency transactional gains and losses are recognized within other income (expense), net in the
consolidated statements of operations, inclusive of the effects of any related hedging activities, and reflected net losses of $5.6 million, $3.1 million, and $4.5
million in Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income, which is reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of equity, consists of
net income and certain other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from net income and referred to as OCI. Components of
OCI consist of foreign currency translation gains (losses); net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, such as forward foreign currency
exchange contracts; net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments; and net realized and unrealized gains (losses) related to the
Company's defined benefit plans.
Net Income per Common Share
Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shares by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Weighted-average common shares include shares of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock. Diluted net
income per common share adjusts basic net income per common share for the dilutive effects of outstanding restricted stock units ("RSUs") and any other
potentially dilutive instruments and stock-based compensation awards using the treasury stock method, only for periods in which such effects are dilutive.
The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic net income per common share is reconciled to shares used to
calculate diluted net income per common share as follows:

All earnings per share amounts have been calculated using unrounded numbers. The Company has outstanding performance-based RSUs, which are
included in the computation of diluted shares only to the extent that the underlying performance conditions (i) have been satisfied as of the end of the
reporting period or (ii) would be considered satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency period and the result would be
dilutive. As of the end of Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, there were 0.2 million, 0.3 million, and 0.3 million, respectively, of additional shares
issuable contingent upon vesting of performance-based RSUs that were excluded from the diluted shares calculations.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date
fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures which are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and
expected future trends. The grant date fair values of service-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs are determined based on the fair value of the
Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do
not accrue while outstanding and unvested. The grant date fair value of the Company's market-based RSU awards, for which vesting is dependent upon total
shareholder return ("TSR") of its Class A common stock over a three-year performance period relative to that of a pre-established peer group, is estimated
using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Compensation expense for all performance-based RSUs is recognized over the requisite service period when attainment of the performance goal is
deemed probable, net of estimated forfeitures. Compensation expense for market-based RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the requisite
service period regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied. The Company recognizes compensation expense on
an accelerated basis for all awards with graded vesting terms, including certain RSUs. For RSU awards with cliff vesting terms, compensation expense is
recognized on a straight-line basis. For certain RSU awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who will become retirement-eligible prior
to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, the related compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis over a term commensurate
with the period that the employee is required to provide service in order to vest in the award. See Note 18 for further discussion of the Company's stock-based
compensation plans.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less, including investments in time deposits and
debt securities. Investments in debt securities are diversified across high-credit quality issuers in accordance with the Company's risk-management policies.
Restricted Cash
The Company is periodically required to place cash in escrow with various banks as collateral, primarily to secure guarantees of corresponding
amounts made by the banks to international tax authorities on behalf of the Company, such as to secure refunds of value-added tax payments in certain
international tax jurisdictions or in the case of certain international tax audits, as well as to secure guarantees related to certain real estate leases. Such cash is
classified as restricted cash and reported as a component of either prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets in the consolidated
balance sheets.
Investments
The Company's investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit risk,
and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in the Company's investment policy.
Short-term investments consist of investments which the Company expects to convert into cash within one year, including any time deposits and debt
securities with original maturities greater than 90 days. See Note 13 for further information relating to the composition of the Company's short-term
investments.
The Company classifies such investments as available-for-sale. Accordingly, they are recorded at fair value with any related unrealized gains or losses
generally recognized as a component of AOCI in the consolidated balance sheets, and related realized gains or losses (or unrealized credit-related impairment
losses, if any) recorded within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. Cash inflows and outflows related to the sale and
purchase of investments are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Equity-method and Other Investments
Ownership interests that provide the Company with significant influence, but less than a controlling interest, over an investee are generally accounted
for using the equity method of accounting. Significant influence is generally presumed to exist when the Company owns between 20% and 50% of the
investee's common stock. Ownership interests that do not provide significant influence and for which the underlying equity security's fair value is not readily
determinable are generally recorded at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar
investments of the same investee, with such adjustments recognized within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations.
Under the equity method of accounting, the following amounts are generally recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements: the
Company's original investment, as subsequently adjusted for its share of the investee's earnings (losses) and reduced by any dividends received and other-
than-temporary impairments recorded, is included in the consolidated balance sheets; the Company's share of the investee's periodic earnings (losses) is
included in the consolidated statements of operations; and dividends and other cash distributions received from the investee and additional cash investments
made in or other cash paid to the investee are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company's share of equity-

method investee earnings and losses is recognized within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations and was not material in
any of the fiscal years presented.
These investments are recorded within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
Impairment Assessment
The Company evaluates the need to recognize impairment charges for its investments that are in unrealized loss positions, if any, and its other equity
investments on a quarterly basis (see Note 12). Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of the risks and uncertainties
associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers or investees. Factors considered by the Company include (i) the
financial condition, creditworthiness, and near-term prospects of the issuer or investee; (ii) future economic conditions and market forecasts; (iii) the length of
time to maturity, if applicable, and an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery
of market value; and (iv) whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the investment's carrying amount might not be recoverable.
Accounts Receivable
In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to wholesale customers that satisfy certain defined credit criteria. Payment is generally
due within 30 to 120 days and does not involve a significant financing component. Accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates
fair value, and are presented in the consolidated balance sheets net of certain reserves and allowances. These reserves and allowances consist of (i) reserves
for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances (see the "Revenue Recognition"
section above for further discussion of related accounting policies) and (ii) allowances for doubtful accounts.
A rollforward of the activity in the Company's reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain
cooperative advertising allowances is presented as follows:

Amounts recorded to bad debt expense are included within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company sells its wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world,
and extends credit based on an evaluation of each customer's financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. In the Company's
wholesale business, concentration of credit risk is relatively limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas.
However, the Company has three key wholesale customers that generate significant sales volume. During Fiscal 2025, the Company's sales to these three
customers accounted for approximately 12% of total net revenues. Approximately 70% of sales to the Company's three largest wholesale customers related to
its North America segment and approximately 30% related to its Europe segment. As of March 29, 2025, these three wholesale customers accounted for
approximately 25% of total gross accounts receivable.
Inventories
The Company holds inventory that is sold in its retail stores and digital commerce sites directly to consumers. The Company also holds inventory that
is to be sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners. Substantially all of the
Company's inventories consist of finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted-
average cost basis.
The estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of the Company's individual product lines, the
impact of market trends and economic conditions (such as those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events), and a forecast of future
demand, giving consideration to the value of current in-house orders for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell inventory through the Company's
outlet stores, among other liquidation channels. Actual results may differ from estimates due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory,
consumer and retailer preferences, and actual economic and market conditions. In addition, reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical
loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. The Company's historical estimates of
the realizable value of its inventory and its reserves for inventory shrinkage have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse
future economic and market conditions could result in the Company's actual results differing materially from its estimates.
Supplier Finance Program
The Company supports a voluntary supplier finance program which provides certain of its inventory suppliers the opportunity, at their sole discretion,
to sell their receivables due from the Company (which are generally due within 90 days) to a participating financial institution in exchange for receipt of a
discounted payment amount made earlier than the payment term stipulated between the Company and the supplier. The Company's vendor payment terms and
amounts due are not impacted by a supplier's decision to participate in the program. The Company has not pledged any assets and does not provide guarantees
under the supplier finance program. The Company's payment obligations outstanding under its supplier finance program were $181.0 million and $129.2
million as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, respectively, which were recorded within accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets.

Implementation Costs Incurred in Cloud Computing Arrangements
For cloud computing arrangements that are a service contract, the Company capitalizes certain implementation costs incurred (depending on their
nature) during the application development stage of the related project, and expenses costs during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages as
they are incurred. Capitalized implementation costs are expensed on a straight-line basis over the reasonably certain term of the hosting arrangement,
beginning when the module is ready for its intended use. The Company's cloud computing arrangements relate to various areas, including certain retail store
and digital commerce operations, and corporate and administrative functions. Capitalized amounts related to such arrangements are recorded within prepaid
expenses and other current assets and within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 7). Capitalized implementation costs
expensed were $10.2 million, $9.1 million, and $6.3 million during Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively, and were recorded in SG&A
expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis, based upon the estimated
useful lives of depreciable assets, which range from 3 to 7 years for furniture and fixtures, machinery and equipment, and capitalized software; and from 10 to
40 years for buildings and improvements. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the
term of the related lease.
Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable (see Note 12). In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, including finite-lived
intangibles as described below, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from its use of the asset and its eventual disposition,
where applicable. If such estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is
recognized to the extent that such asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, as estimated considering external market participant assumptions and
discounted cash flows. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal (commonly referred to as assets held-for-sale) are
reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.
Leases
The Company's lease arrangements primarily relate to real estate, including its retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, corporate offices, and
warehouse facilities and, to a lesser extent, certain equipment and other assets. The Company's leases generally have initial terms ranging from 3 to 10 years
and may include renewal or early-termination options, rent escalation clauses, and/or lease incentives in the form of construction allowances and rent
abatements. The Company is typically required to make fixed minimum rent payments, variable rent payments based on performance (e.g., percentage-of-
sales-based payments), or a combination thereof, relating to its right to use an underlying leased asset. The Company is also often required to pay for certain
other costs that do not relate specifically to its right to use an underlying leased asset, but that are associated with the asset, including real estate taxes,
insurance, common area maintenance fees, and/or certain other costs (referred to collectively herein as "non-lease components"), which may be fixed or
variable in amount, depending on the terms of the respective lease agreement. The Company's leases do not contain significantly restrictive covenants or
residual value guarantees.
The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at the arrangement's inception. If a lease is determined to exist, its related term is
assessed at the lease commencement date, once the underlying asset is made available by the lessor for the Company's use. The Company's assessment of the
lease term reflects the non-cancellable period of the lease, inclusive of any rent-free periods, plus any periods covered by early-termination options for which
the Company is not considered reasonably certain of exercising, as well as periods covered by renewal options for which it is considered reasonably certain of
exercising. The Company also determines lease classification as either operating or finance at lease commencement, which governs the pattern of expense
recognition and the presentation thereof in the consolidated statements of operations over the lease term.
For leases with a lease term exceeding 12 months, a liability is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at the lease commencement date reflecting
the present value of its related fixed payment obligations over such term. A corresponding right-of-use ("ROU") asset equal to the initial lease liability is also
recorded, increased by any prepaid rent and/or initial direct costs incurred in connection with execution of the lease, and reduced by any incentives provided
by the lessor. The Company also includes fixed payment obligations related to non-lease components in the measurement of its ROU assets and lease
liabilities,
F-15

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
given its election to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component. Variable lease payments are not included in the
measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets associated with finance leases are presented separately from those associated with operating
leases, and are included within property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheet. For purposes of measuring the present value of its fixed
payment obligations for a given lease, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, determined based on information available at lease commencement,
given that rates implicit in its leasing arrangements are not readily determinable. The Company's incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate it would pay to
borrow on a secured basis an amount equal to the lease payments and incorporates the term and economic environment of the lease.
For operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as operating lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the
initial ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term, along with recognition of interest expense associated with accretion of the
remaining lease liability, which is ultimately reduced by the related fixed payments as they are made. For leases with a lease term of 12 months or less
(referred to as a "short-term lease"), any fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over such term and are not recognized on the
consolidated balance sheet. For all leases, variable lease cost, if any, is recognized as incurred.
ROU assets, along with any related long-lived assets, are periodically evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their
carrying values may not be fully recoverable (see Note 12). To the extent that such assets are ultimately determined to be impaired, they are written down
accordingly on a relative carrying amount basis, with the ROU asset written down to an amount no lower than its estimated fair value. Subsequent to the
recognition of any such impairment, total remaining lease cost is recognized on a front-loaded basis over the remaining lease term.
Under certain of its lease arrangements, the Company is contractually obligated to remove its leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term. For
such arrangements, the Company records an asset retirement obligation ("ARO") at lease inception for the estimated fair value, with a corresponding increase
in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The ARO is adjusted for any changes in estimates and the related long-lived asset is depreciated over its
useful life. Activity related to these obligations were not material during any of the fiscal years presented. The Company's ARO balances are recorded within
other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 7).
See Note 14 for further discussion of the Company's leases.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
At acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which typically consist of reacquired license
agreements, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and/or order backlog. The fair values of these intangible assets are estimated based on
management's assessment, considering independent third-party appraisals when necessary. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net
assets acquired, both tangible and intangible, is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are
not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. The Company generally performs its
annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analyses using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that
the fair values of such assets are less than their respective carrying values. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is concluded that it is not
more likely than not that the fair value of the asset exceeds its carrying value, a quantitative test is performed. Under the quantitative test, if the carrying value
of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess. The Company also periodically performs a quantitative test to
assess its goodwill for impairment in lieu of using the qualitative approach in order to reassess the fair values of its reporting units.
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets as noted above, are
evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable.
See discussion of the Company's accounting policy for long-lived asset impairment as previously described under the caption "Property and Equipment, Net."

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Income Taxes
Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current taxes
payable/refunds receivable, and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the results of any difference
between U.S. GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating losses, capital losses, general business credit
carryforwards, and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax
purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of
enactment.
In addition, valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax
asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur or circumstances change that warrant adjustments.
In determining the income tax benefit (provision) for financial reporting purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If the
Company considers that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, it recognizes
the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement,
presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be
complex and the Company often obtains assistance from external advisors. To the extent that the Company's estimates change or the final tax outcome of
these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax benefit (provision) in the period in which such
determinations are made. If the initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, the Company regularly monitors its position and
subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the
technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement
of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the Company expects to pay cash within the next
twelve months. Interest and penalties are recorded within the income tax benefit (provision) in the consolidated statements of operations and are classified on
the consolidated balance sheets together with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company accounts for the minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") in the period in which it is incurred.
See Note 10 for further discussion of the Company's income taxes.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company records derivative financial instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting are either (i) offset through earnings against the changes in fair value of the related hedged
assets, liabilities, or firm commitments or (ii) recognized in equity as a component of AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, depending on
whether the instrument is hedging against changes in fair value or cash flows and net investments, respectively.
Each derivative instrument that qualifies for hedge accounting is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the risk associated with the related
exposure. For each instrument that is designated as a hedge, the Company documents the related risk management objective and strategy, including
identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, and the risk exposure, as well as how hedge effectiveness will be assessed over the instrument's
term. To assess hedge effectiveness at the inception of a hedging relationship, the Company generally uses regression analysis, a statistical method, to
evaluate how changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are expected to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of the related hedged item.
The extent to which a hedging instrument has been and is expected to remain highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows is
assessed by the Company on at least a quarterly basis.
Given its use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual
obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, the Company's policy is to only enter into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based
upon an evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. The Company's established policies and
procedures for mitigating credit risk include ongoing review and assessment of its counterparties' creditworthiness. The Company also enters into master
netting

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
arrangements with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. In the event of default or termination, these arrangements allow the Company
to net-settle amounts payable and receivable related to multiple derivative transactions with the same counterparty. The master netting arrangements specify a
number of events of default and termination, including the failure to make timely payments.
The fair values of the Company's derivative instruments are recorded on its consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. For cash flow reporting
purposes, proceeds received or amounts paid upon the settlement of a derivative instrument are classified in the same manner as the related item being
hedged, primarily within cash flows from operating activities for its forward foreign exchange contracts and within cash flows from investing activities for its
cross-currency swap contracts, both as discussed below.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate its risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions
made in an entity's non-functional currency. To the extent designated as cash flow hedges, related gains or losses on such instruments are initially deferred in
equity as a component of AOCI and are subsequently recognized within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations when the related
inventory is sold.
If a derivative instrument is dedesignated or if hedge accounting is discontinued because the instrument is not expected to be highly effective in
hedging the designated exposure, any further gains (losses) are recognized in earnings each period within other income (expense), net. Upon discontinuance
of hedge accounting, the cumulative change in fair value of the derivative instrument recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the related hedged
item affects earnings, consistent with the hedging strategy, unless the related forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring, in which case the
accumulated amount is immediately recognized within other income (expense), net.
Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations
The Company periodically uses cross-currency swap contracts to reduce risk associated with exchange rate fluctuations on certain of its net
investments in foreign subsidiaries. Changes in the fair values of such derivative instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign
operations are recorded in equity as a component of AOCI in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. In assessing the effectiveness of
such hedges, the Company uses a method based on changes in spot rates to measure the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on both its
foreign subsidiary net investment and the related hedging instrument. Under this method, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument other than those
due to changes in the spot rate are initially recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are amortized into earnings as interest expense using a
systematic and rational method over the instrument's term. Changes in fair value associated with the effective portion (i.e., those due to changes in the spot
rate) are recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are released and recognized in earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the hedged net
investment.
Undesignated Hedges
The Company uses undesignated hedges primarily to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk related to third-party and intercompany balances and
exposures. Changes in the fair values of such instruments are recognized in earnings each period within other income (expense), net.
See Note 13 for further discussion of the Company's derivative financial instruments.

4.    Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2024-03, "Disaggregation
of Income Statement Expenses" ("ASU 2024-03"). ASU 2024-03 requires interim and annual tabular disclosure of disaggregated information for certain
income statement expense captions. Specific expense categories required to be disclosed quantitatively include inventory purchases, employee compensation,
depreciation, and intangible asset amortization, as well as other specified expense categories currently disclosed under existing disclosure requirements.
Additionally, any remaining amounts that are not separately disaggregated are required to be described qualitatively. ASU 2024-03 also requires separate
disclosure of total selling expenses incurred each reporting period, with annual disclosure of the entity's definition of selling expenses. The annual disclosures
required by ASU 2024-03 are effective for the Company beginning in its fiscal year ending April 1, 2028 ("Fiscal 2028"), with interim disclosures effective
beginning in its fiscal year ending March 31, 2029 ("Fiscal 2029"). The provisions of ASU 2024-03 are to be applied prospectively, although retrospective
application is permitted. Early adoption is also permitted. Other than the new disclosure requirements, ASU 2024-03 will not have an impact on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, "Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" ("ASU 2023-09"). ASU 2023-09 is intended to
enhance the transparency and usefulness of annual income tax disclosures. Among its provisions, ASU 2023-09 requires disclosure of a reconciliation
between an entity's effective tax rate, which is calculated by dividing each fiscal period's income tax provision by pretax income, and its statutory rate
utilizing eight specific categories, along with a separate disclosure for reconciling items that meet a 5% quantitative threshold. In addition, ASU 2023-09
requires disclosure of income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes, as well as by individual jurisdictions if a
5% quantitative threshold is met. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning in Fiscal 2026, and is to be applied prospectively,
although retrospective application is permitted. Early adoption is also permitted. Other than the new disclosure requirements, ASU 2023-09 will not have an
impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, "Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" ("ASU 2023-07"). ASU 2023-07 requires
entities to make certain enhanced segment disclosures on both an annual and interim basis, including disclosure of significant segment expenses that are
regularly provided to their chief operating decision maker (the "CODM") as defined within Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, "Segment
Reporting," as well as various information about an entity's CODM, among other provisions. ASU 2023-07 does not change how entities identify their
operating segments, aggregate them, or apply the quantitative thresholds to determine their reportable segments. The annual disclosures required by ASU
2023-07 are effective for the Company beginning in Fiscal 2025, with interim disclosures effective beginning in Fiscal 2026. The Company adopted ASU
2023-07 in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2025 and applied its provisions on a retrospective basis. Other than the new disclosure requirements, ASU 2023-07 did
not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 20 for further discussion of the Company's segments.
Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations
In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, "Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations" ("ASU 2022-04"). ASU 2022-04
requires entities to disclose the key terms of supplier finance programs they use in connection with the purchase of goods and services, along with the amount
of obligations outstanding at the end of each period and an annual rollforward of such obligations. This standard does not affect the recognition,
measurement, or financial statement presentation of supplier finance program obligations. ASU 2022-04 became effective for the Company beginning in
Fiscal 2024. The Company has made all required disclosures for all dates as of which a balance sheet is presented, except for the annual rollforward
disclosure, which was adopted and applied prospectively in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2025. Other than the new disclosure requirements, ASU 2022-04 did
not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's supplier finance program.

9.    Restructuring and Other Charges, Net
A description of significant restructuring and other activities and their related costs is provided below.
Fiscal 2025 Restructuring Activities
During Fiscal 2025, the Company recorded restructuring-related charges of $20.4  million, comprised of cash-related restructuring charges of
$15.5  million, primarily associated with severance and benefit costs, and non-cash-related charges of $4.9  million, primarily related to stock-based
compensation expense recorded in connection with an employment separation agreement. As of March 29, 2025, the remaining liability related to the cash-
related charges was $10.9 million, reflecting cash payments of $4.6 million made during Fiscal 2025.
Fiscal 2024 Restructuring Activities
During Fiscal 2024, the Company recorded cumulative restructuring-related charges of $55.8  million, comprised of cash-related charges of
$54.5 million, primarily associated with severance and benefit costs, and non-cash-related charges of $1.3 million. As of March 29, 2025, the remaining
liability related to the cash-related charges was $8.0 million, reflecting cash payments of $22.4 million and $0.2 million of non-cash adjustments made during
Fiscal 2025. As of March 30, 2024, the remaining liability related to the cash-related charges was $30.2 million, reflecting cash payments of $24.1 million
and $0.2 million of non-cash adjustments made during Fiscal 2024.
Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan
From Fiscal 2021 through Fiscal 2023, the Company undertook efforts to realign its resources to support future growth and profitability, and to create a
sustainable, enhanced cost structure. The key areas of the Company's initiatives underlying these efforts involved evaluation of its: (i) team organizational
structures and ways of working; (ii) real estate footprint and related costs across its corporate offices, distribution centers, and direct-to-consumer retail and
wholesale doors; and (iii) brand portfolio.
In connection with the first initiative, on September 17, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the "Fiscal 2021
Strategic Realignment Plan") to reduce its global workforce. Additionally, during a preliminary review of its store portfolio during the second quarter of
Fiscal 2021, the Company decided to close its Polo store on Regent Street in London.
Shortly thereafter, on October 29, 2020, the Company announced the planned transition of its Chaps brand to a fully licensed business model,
consistent with its long-term brand elevation strategy and in connection with its third initiative. Specifically, the Company entered into a multi-year licensing
partnership, which took effect on August 1, 2021 following a transition period, with an affiliate of 5 Star Apparel LLC, a division of the OVED Group, to
manufacture, market, and distribute Chaps menswear and womenswear. This agreement created incremental value for the Company by enabling an even
greater focus on elevating its core brands in the marketplace, reducing its direct exposure to the North America department store channel, and setting up
Chaps to deliver on its potential with an experienced partner that is focused on nurturing the brand.
Later, on February 3, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved additional actions related to its real estate initiative. Specifically, the Company
further rightsized and consolidated its global corporate offices to better align with its organizational profile and new ways of working. The Company also
closed certain of its stores to improve overall profitability. Additionally, the Company further consolidated its North America distribution centers in order to
drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability, and deliver a better consumer experience.
Finally, on June 26, 2021, in connection with its brand portfolio initiative, the Company sold its former Club Monaco business to Regent, L.P., a global
private equity firm, with no resulting gain or loss on sale realized during the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year ending April 2, 2022. Regent, L.P.
acquired Club Monaco's assets and liabilities in exchange for potential future cash consideration payable to the Company, including earn-out payments based
on Club Monaco meeting certain defined revenue thresholds over a five-year period. Accordingly, the Company has realized amounts related to the receipt of
such contingent consideration (as discussed further below) and additional amounts may be realized in the future. Additionally, in connection with this
divestiture, the Company provided Regent, L.P. with certain operational support for a transitional period of approximately one year, varying by functional
area.

Monaco business, pursuant to certain clauses included in the securities and asset purchase agreement. The Company donated this income to The Ralph Lauren
Corporate Foundation, a non-profit, charitable foundation, which resulted in related offsetting donation expense of $2.8 million, $7.0 million, and $3.5
million during Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively. The income and related offsetting donation expense amounts during Fiscal 2025, Fiscal

Next Generation Transformation Project
The Company is in the early stages of executing a large-scale, multi-year global project that is expected to significantly transform the way in which the
Company operates its business and further enable its long-term strategic pivot towards a global direct-to-consumer-oriented model (the "Next Generation
Transformation project" or "NGT project"). The NGT project will be completed in phases and involves the redesigning of certain end-to-end processes and
the implementation of a suite of technology systems on a global scale. Such efforts are expected to result in significant process improvements and the creation
of synergies across core areas of operations, including merchandise buying and planning, procurement, inventory management, retail and wholesale
operations, and financial planning and reporting, better enabling the Company to optimize inventory levels and increase the speed with which it reacts to
changes in consumer demand across markets, among other benefits. In connection with the preliminary phase of the NGT project, the Company recorded
other charges of $25.2 million and $5.1 million during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively.
Previously Exited Real Estate
The Company recorded other charges of $11.4 million, $14.0 million, and $23.8 million during Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively,
primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations in connection with the Company's past

Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the income tax provision by income before income taxes.
The Company's Fiscal 2025 effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% primarily due to uncertain tax positions
and compensation-related adjustments, partially offset by a favorable tax adjustment related to the revaluation of a deferred tax liability on foreign earnings
and the favorable tax impact of earnings generated in lower taxed foreign jurisdictions versus the U.S.
The Company's Fiscal 2024 effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% primarily due to deferred tax benefits
recognized as a result of transactions entered into as part of a reorganization of the Company's legal entity structure, recently enacted changes in tax
legislation, and the favorable tax impact of earnings generated in lower taxed

foreign jurisdictions versus the U.S., partially offset by an increase in income tax reserves. Additionally, the lower effective tax rate for Fiscal 2024 was also
driven by favorable adjustments related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets arising from Swiss tax reform and favorable deferred tax adjustments related
to the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive.
The Company's Fiscal 2023 effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% primarily due to the unfavorable impact
of certain foreign deferred adjustments, compensation-related adjustments, and state taxes.

$288.3 million, respectively, recorded within deferred tax assets, and non-current deferred tax liabilities of $5.9 million and $7.0 million,
respectively, recorded within other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company has available state net operating loss carryforwards of $1.8 million (net of tax), for tax purposes to offset future taxable income. There
are no federal or foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to the Company. The net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in the Company's
fiscal year ending April 3, 2032.
The Company also has available state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $5.4 million and $1.7 million (both net of tax), respectively, for
which no net deferred tax asset has been recognized. A full valuation allowance has been recorded against these carryforwards since the Company does not
believe that it will more likely than not be able to utilize these carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Subsequent recognition of these deferred tax
assets would result in an income tax benefit in the year of such recognition. The valuation allowance relating to state net operating loss carryforwards remains
consistent with prior year for jurisdictions where the Company will no longer be able to utilize the carryforwards in the future. The valuation allowance
relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards decreased by $0.5 million, mainly due to the write-off of related net operating losses in jurisdictions where
the Company will no longer be able to utilize the carryforwards in the future.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
In January 2018, new U.S. tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") became effective. The TCJA significantly
revised U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, creating a territorial tax system that included a one-time mandatory transition tax on previously deferred
foreign earnings. As a result of the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the TCJA, the Company reevaluated its permanent
reinvestment assertion and determined that undistributed foreign earnings that were subject to the TCJA's one-time mandatory transition tax were no longer
considered to be permanently reinvested, effective December 31, 2017. The mandatory transition tax does not apply to undistributed foreign earnings
generated after December 31, 2017. Accordingly, provision has not been made for U.S.  or additional foreign taxes on approximately $3.717 billion of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries generated after December 31, 2017, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested. These earnings
could become subject to tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings were lent to RLC, a subsidiary or a U.S. affiliate of RLC, or if the stock of
the subsidiaries were sold. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
On August 26, 2024, the U.S. Tax Court issued a decision in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Commissioner related to the TCJA deduction for certain
deemed foreign dividends otherwise subject to the transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of applicable foreign subsidiaries. Based on the Company's
evaluation of the technical merits of this decision, during Fiscal 2025 it filed a protective refund claim with the Internal Revenue Service claiming a transition
tax refund of $34.4 million, for which the Company recorded a corresponding deferred tax asset. However, as the Company believes it is more-likely-than-not
that the intended refund claim will not be received, during Fiscal 2025 it also recorded an uncertain tax position reserve for the full refund claim of $34.4
million. Accordingly, on a net basis, this development had no resulting impact to the Company's effective tax rates or its consolidated statements of operations
during Fiscal 2025.
Future Changes in Unrecognized Tax Benefits
The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the Company's tax positions is subject to change based on future events including, but not
limited to, settlements of ongoing tax audits and assessments and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Although the outcomes and timing of
such events are highly uncertain, the Company does not anticipate that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, will
change significantly during the next twelve months. However, changes in the occurrence, expected outcomes, and timing of such events could cause the
Company's current estimate to change materially in the future.
The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as tax returns in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company
is generally no longer subject to examinations by the relevant tax authorities for years prior to its fiscal year ended March 29, 2014.

$8.5 million as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, respectively.
Senior Notes
In August 2018, the Company completed a registered public debt offering and issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior
notes due September 15, 2025, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.750%, payable semi-annually (the "3.750% Senior Notes"). The 3.750% Senior Notes
were issued at a price equal to 99.521% of their principal amount. The proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate purposes, including
repayment of the Company's previously outstanding $300 million principal amount of 2.125% unsecured senior notes that matured September 26, 2018.
In June 2020, the Company completed another registered public debt offering and issued an additional $500 million aggregate principal amount of
unsecured senior notes that were due and repaid on June 15, 2022 with cash on hand, which bore interest at a fixed rate of 1.700%, payable semi-annually (the
"1.700% Senior Notes"), and $750 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due June 15, 2030, which bear interest at a fixed rate of
2.950%, payable semi-annually (the "2.950% Senior Notes"). The 1.700% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes were issued at prices equal to 99.880% and
98.995% of their principal amounts, respectively. The proceeds from these offerings were used for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment
of $475 million previously outstanding under the Company's Global Credit Facility (as defined

below) on June 3, 2020 and repayment of its previously outstanding $300 million principal amount of 2.625% unsecured senior notes that matured August 18,
2020.
The Company has the option to redeem the 3.750% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes (collectively, the "Senior Notes"), in whole or in part, at
any time at a price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the series of Senior
Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present value of Remaining Scheduled Payments, as defined in the supplemental indentures governing such Senior
Notes (together with the indenture governing the Senior Notes, the "Indenture"). The Indenture contains certain covenants that restrict the Company's ability,
subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge with another party; or sell, lease, or
convey all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does not contain any financial covenants.
Commercial Paper
The Company has a commercial paper borrowing program that allows it to issue up to $750 million of unsecured commercial paper notes through
private placement using third-party broker-dealers (the "Commercial Paper Program").
Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Global Credit Facility (as defined below). Accordingly, the Company does not
expect combined borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and Global Credit Facility to exceed $750 million. Commercial Paper
Program borrowings may be used to support the Company's general working capital and corporate needs. Maturities of commercial paper notes vary, but
cannot exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. Commercial paper notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program rank equally in seniority with the
Company's other forms of unsecured indebtedness. As of both March  29, 2025 and March  30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the
Commercial Paper Program.
Revolving Credit Facilities
Global Credit Facility
In June 2023, the Company terminated its then existing credit facility and entered into a new credit facility that provides for a $750 million senior
unsecured revolving line of credit through June 30, 2028 (the "Global Credit Facility") under terms and conditions substantially similar to those of the
previous facility. The Global Credit Facility may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures, certain investments, general corporate purposes, and
for funding of acquisitions. The Global Credit Facility may also be used to support the issuance of letters of credit and maintenance of the Commercial Paper
Program. Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and certain other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars,
and Japanese Yen, and are guaranteed by some of the Company's domestic subsidiaries, including all of the Company's significant subsidiaries. In accordance
with the terms of the agreement governing the Global Credit Facility, the Company has the ability to expand its borrowing availability under the Global Credit
Facility to $1.500 billion, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. There are no
mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility.
Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, either (a) an alternate base rate or (b)
an adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") rate or the applicable currency in which the loans are made (the "Term Benchmark Rate") plus
an applicable margin. The applicable margin for Term Benchmark Rate loans will be adjusted by reference to a grid (the "Pricing Grid"), which is included in
the definition of "Applicable Rate" within the Global Credit Facility agreement and is based on ratings for the Company's senior, unsecured long-term
indebtedness provided by established ratings agencies. In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Global Credit Facility, the
Company is required to pay a commitment fee, calculated at a rate per annum determined in accordance with the Pricing Grid, on the average daily unused
amount of the Facility, payable quarterly in arrears, and certain fees with respect to Letters of Credit that are issued. The current commitment fee rate of 8
basis points is subject to adjustment based on the Company's credit ratings. As of both March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, there were no borrowings
outstanding under the Global Credit Facility. However, the Company was contingently liable for $10.6 million and $11.8 million of outstanding letters of
credit as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, respectively.
The Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company's ability, subject to specified exceptions, to
incur additional debt; incur liens; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are
not in a related line of business; make loans, advances, or

guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make certain investments. The Global Credit Facility also requires the Company to maintain a
maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR (the "leverage ratio") of no greater than 4.25 as of the date of measurement for the four most
recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Adjusted Debt is defined generally as consolidated debt outstanding, including finance lease obligations, plus all operating
lease obligations. Consolidated EBITDAR is defined generally as consolidated net income plus (i)  income tax expense, (ii)  net interest expense,
(iii) depreciation and amortization expense, (iv) operating lease cost, (v) restructuring and other non-recurring expenses, and (vi) acquisition-related costs.
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Global Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Global Credit Facility,
and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Global Credit Facility specifies various events of default (many of which are
subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure to make timely principal, interest, and fee payments or to satisfy the covenants,
including the financial covenant described above. Additionally, the Global Credit Facility provides that an Event of Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren,
the Company's Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage
of the voting power of the Company's common stock. As of March 29, 2025, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit
Facility) has occurred under the Company's Global Credit Facility.
Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities
Certain of the Company's subsidiaries in Asia have uncommitted credit facilities with regional branches of JPMorgan Chase in China and South Korea
(the "Pan-Asia Credit Facilities"). Additionally, the Company's Japan subsidiary has an uncommitted overdraft facility with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corporation (the "Japan Overdraft Facility"). The Pan-Asia Credit Facilities and Japan Overdraft Facility (collectively, the "Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities")
are subject to annual renewal and may be used to fund general working capital needs of the Company's operations in the respective countries. Borrowings
under the Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities are guaranteed by the parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the respective banks, subject to
availability of the banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. The Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities do not contain any financial covenants.
A summary of the Company's Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities by country is as follows:
•
China Credit Facility — provides Ralph Lauren Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. with a revolving line of credit of up to 100 million Chinese
Renminbi (approximately $13 million) through April 3, 2026, which is also able to be used to support bank guarantees.
•
South Korea Credit Facility — provides Ralph Lauren (Korea) Ltd. with a revolving line of credit of up to 30 billion South Korean Won
(approximately $20 million) through October 24, 2025.
•
Japan Overdraft Facility — provides Ralph Lauren Corporation Japan with an overdraft amount of up to 5 billion Japanese Yen (approximately
$33 million) through April 30, 2026.
As of both March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities.
12.    Fair Value Measurements
U.S. GAAP prescribes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The determination of the applicable level within the
hierarchy for a particular asset or liability depends on the inputs used in its valuation as of the measurement date, notably the extent to which the inputs are
market-based (observable) or internally-derived (unobservable). A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:
•
Level 1 — inputs to the valuation methodology based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•
Level 2 — inputs to the valuation methodology based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets for substantially the full
term of the financial instrument; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active for substantially the full term of
the financial instrument; and model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are observable.

•
Level  3  — inputs to the valuation methodology based on unobservable prices or valuation techniques that are significant to the fair value
measurement.

Based on Level 2 measurements.
The Company's derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets and are valued using pricing models that
are primarily based on market observable external inputs, including spot and forward currency exchange rates, benchmark interest rates, and discount rates
consistent with the instrument's tenor, and consider the impact of the Company's own credit risk, if any. Changes in counterparty credit risk are also
considered in the valuation of derivative financial instruments.
To the extent the Company invests in commercial paper, such investments are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in its
consolidated balance sheets using external pricing data, based on interest rates and credit ratings for similar issuances with the same remaining term as the
Company's investments. To the extent the Company invests in bonds, such investments are also classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in its
consolidated balance sheets based on quoted prices in active markets.
The Company's cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and time deposits are recorded at carrying value, which generally approximates fair value
based on Level 1 measurements.
The Company's debt instruments are recorded at their amortized cost in its consolidated balance sheets, which may differ from their respective fair
values. The fair values of the Company's senior notes are estimated based on external pricing data, including available quoted market prices, and with
reference to comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates, credit ratings, and trading frequency, among other factors. The fair values of the
Company's commercial paper notes and borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities, if any, are estimated using external pricing data, based on interest
rates and credit ratings for similar issuances with the same remaining term as the Company's outstanding borrowings. Due to their short-term nature, the fair
values of the Company's commercial paper notes and borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities, if any, generally approximate their amortized cost
carrying values.
The following table summarizes the carrying values and the estimated fair values of the Company's debt instruments:

Non-financial Assets and Liabilities
The Company's non-financial assets, which primarily consist of goodwill, other intangible assets, property and equipment, and lease-related ROU
assets, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and instead are reported at their amortized or depreciated cost in its consolidated
balance sheet. However, on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be fully recoverable (and at least
annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets), the respective carrying value of non-financial assets are assessed for impairment and, if
ultimately considered impaired, are adjusted and written down to their fair value, as estimated based on consideration of external market participant
assumptions and discounted cash flows.
During Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of certain long-lived assets to their
estimated fair values. The fair values of these assets were determined based on Level 3 measurements, the related inputs of which included estimates of the
amount and timing of the assets' net future discounted cash flows (including any potential sublease income for lease-related ROU assets), based on historical
experience and consideration of current trends, market conditions, and comparable sales, as applicable. No impairment charges were recorded during Fiscal
2024.
The following table summarizes impairment charges recorded by the Company during the fiscal years presented to reduce the carrying values of
certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values as of the assessment date:

See Note 8 for additional discussion regarding impairment charges recorded by the Company within the consolidated statements of operations during
the fiscal years presented.
The Company performed its annual goodwill assessment using a qualitative approach as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2025. In
performing the assessment, the Company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affected the fair
values and/or carrying amounts of its reporting units with allocated goodwill. These factors included external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and
market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as the Company's actual and expected financial performance. Additionally, the Company also
considered the results of its most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test, which was performed as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2024,
the results of which indicated that the fair values of these reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. Based on the results of the
qualitative impairment assessment, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than their
respective carrying values and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment. No impairment charges associated with goodwill or other intangible assets
were recorded during any of the three fiscal years presented.

Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily relating to certain anticipated cash flows and the value of the
reported net assets of its international operations, as well as changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate debt obligations attributed to changes in benchmark
interest rates. Accordingly, based on its assessment thereof, the Company may use derivative financial instruments to manage and mitigate such risks. The
Company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

Risk Management Strategies
Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts
The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate its risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions
made in an entity's non-functional currency, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net
assets into U.S. Dollars. As part of its overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the
Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi, the
Company generally hedges a portion of its related exposures anticipated over the next twelve months using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with
maturities of two months to one year to provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure.
Cross-Currency Swap Contracts
The Company periodically designates pay-fixed rate, receive fixed-rate cross-currency swap contracts as hedges of its net investment in certain of its
European subsidiaries. These contracts swap U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed interest rate payments based on the contract's notional amount and the fixed rate
of interest payable on certain of the Company's senior notes for Euro-denominated fixed interest rate payments, thereby economically converting a portion of
its fixed-rate U.S. Dollar-denominated senior note obligations to fixed-rate Euro-denominated obligations.
See Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's accounting policies relating to its derivative financial instruments.
Investments
The Company's short-term investments as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024 were $160.5 million and $121.0 million, respectively, and consisted
of time deposits.
No significant realized or unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments or impairment charges were recorded during any of the fiscal
years presented.
Refer to Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's accounting policies relating to its investments.

15.    Commitments and Contingencies
TCJA Mandatory Transition Tax
In connection with the TCJA's provision that subjects previously deferred foreign earnings to a one-time mandatory transition tax, the Company had a
remaining related income tax payable obligation of $42.2 million as of March 29, 2025, included within current income tax payable in the consolidated
balance sheets, which is expected to be paid in Fiscal 2026.
Employee Agreements
The Company has employment agreements with certain executives in the normal course of business which provide for compensation and certain other
benefits. These agreements also provide for severance payments under certain circumstances.
Other Commitments
Other off-balance sheet firm commitments amounted to $1.589 billion as of March 29, 2025, including inventory purchase commitments of $937.8
million, lease commitments related to lease agreements for which the related lease terms have not yet commenced of $90.0 million, outstanding letters of
credit of $10.6 million, interest payments related to the Company's debt of $129.3 million, a real estate purchase commitment of $116.9 million, and various
other commitments of $304.8 million, primarily comprised of the Company's legally-binding obligations related to sponsorship, licensing, and other
marketing and advertising agreements, information technology-related service agreements, and pension-related obligations.
Other Matters
The Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation, other legal claims, and proceedings involving matters associated with or incidental to its
business, including, among other things, matters involving credit card fraud, trademark and other intellectual property, licensing, importation and exportation
of its products, taxation, unclaimed property, leases, and employee relations. The Company believes at present that the resolution of currently pending matters
will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements. However, the Company's assessment of any
current litigation or other legal claims could potentially change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known or determinations by judges, juries, or
other finders of fact which are not in accord with management's evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or claims.
In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into certain guarantees or other agreements that provide general indemnifications. The
Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements in the past and does not currently anticipate incurring any material
indemnification payments.
16.    Equity
Capital Stock
The Company's capital stock consists of two classes of common stock. There are 500 million shares of Class A common stock and 100 million shares
of Class B common stock authorized to be issued. Shares of Class A and Class B common stock have substantially identical rights, except with respect to
voting rights. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share.
Holders of both stock classes vote together as a single class on all matters presented to the stockholders for their approval, except with respect to the election
and removal of directors or as otherwise required by applicable law. All outstanding shares of Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren, the
Company's Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family, and are convertible at any time into shares of
Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.
Class B Common Stock Conversions
During Fiscal 2024, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., a limited liability company managed by the children of Mr. Ralph Lauren, converted 3.0 million shares
of Class B common stock into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the security's terms. These conversions occurred in connection
with a long-term strategy for estate planning and investment diversification. These transactions resulted in a reclassification within equity and had no other
effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

tax on its shares repurchased during Fiscal 2023.
As of March 29, 2025, the remaining availability under the Company's Class A common stock repurchase program was approximately $352 million.
On May 15, 2025, the Company's Board of Directors approved an expansion of the Company's existing common stock repurchase program that allows it to
repurchase up to an additional $1.500 billion of its Class A common stock, excluding related excise taxes. Repurchases of shares of the Company's Class A
common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions.
In addition, during Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, 0.3 million, 0.4 million, and 0.3 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock,
respectively, at a cost of $56.4 million, $51.5 million, and $34.3 million, respectively, were surrendered to or withheld by the Company in satisfaction of
withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under its long-term stock incentive plans.
Repurchased and surrendered shares are accounted for as treasury stock at cost and held in treasury for future use.
Dividends
The Company has generally maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on its common stock since 2003.
On May 16, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase to the Company's quarterly cash dividend paid on its common stock from
$0.75 to $0.825 per share. Dividends paid amounted to $201.1 million, $194.6 million, and $198.3 million for Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023,
respectively.
On May 15, 2025, the Company's Board of Directors approved an additional increase to the Company's quarterly cash dividend on its common stock
from $0.825 to $0.9125 per share. The first quarterly dividend to reflect this increase is expected to be payable to shareholders of record at close of business
on June 27, 2025 and paid on July 11, 2025.
The Company intends to continue to pay regular dividends on outstanding shares of its common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay
dividends in the future will ultimately be made at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend on the Company's results of operations,
cash requirements, financial condition, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, including economic and market conditions.

18.    Stock-based Compensation
Long-term Stock Incentive Plans
On August 1, 2019, the Company's shareholders approved the 2019 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "2019 Incentive Plan"), which replaced the
Company's Amended and Restated 2010 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "2010 Incentive Plan"). The 2019 Incentive Plan provided for 1.2 million of
new shares authorized for issuance to the participants, in addition to the approximately 3.0 million shares that remained available for issuance under the 2010
Incentive Plan as of August 1, 2019. In addition, any outstanding awards under the 2010 Incentive Plan or the Company's 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive
Plan (the "1997 Incentive Plan") that expire, are forfeited, or are surrendered to the Company in satisfaction of taxes, will become available for issuance under
the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan became effective August 1, 2019 and no further grants will be made under the 2010 Incentive Plan.
Outstanding awards issued prior to August 1, 2019 will continue to remain subject to the terms of the 2010 Incentive Plan or 1997 Incentive Plan, as
applicable. As of March 29, 2025, 2.2 million shares remained available for future issuance under the Company's incentive plans.
Stock-based compensation awards that may be made under the 2019 Incentive Plan include, but are not limited to, (i) RSUs, (ii) restricted stock, and
(iii)  stock options. During the fiscal years presented, annual grants consisted entirely of RSUs. For RSUs granted to retirement-eligible employees, or
employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, vesting continues post-retirement for all or a
portion of the remaining unvested RSUs.
Impact on Results
A summary of total stock-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefits recognized is as follows:

Fiscal 2025 includes $5.3 million of stock-based compensation expense related to an employment separation agreement recorded within
restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations (see Note 9). All other stock-based compensation expense was
recorded within SG&A expenses.
The Company issues its annual grants of stock-based compensation awards in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Due to the timing of the annual
grants and other factors, including the timing and magnitude of forfeiture and performance goal achievement adjustments, as well as changes to the size and
composition of the eligible employee population, stock-based compensation expense recognized during any given fiscal period is not indicative of the level of
compensation expense expected to be incurred in future periods.
Service-based RSUs
Service-based RSUs granted to certain of the Company's senior executives and other employees, as well as non-employee directors, generally vest over
a three-year period, subject to the employee's continuing employment (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become
retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed). The fair values of service-based RSUs are based
on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend
equivalent amounts do not accrue to the holder while outstanding and unvested.

Performance-based RSUs
The Company grants performance-based RSUs to its senior executives and other key employees. The fair values of performance-based RSUs are based
on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend
equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested. Performance-based RSUs generally vest (i) upon the completion of a three-year period of
time (cliff vesting), subject to the employee's continuing employment (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become
retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed) and the Company's achievement of certain
performance goals established at the beginning of the three-year performance period or (ii) ratably, over a three-year period of time (graded vesting), subject
to the employee's continuing employment during the applicable vesting period (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who
become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed) and the achievement by the Company of
certain performance goals in the initial year of the three-year vesting period.
For performance-based RSUs subject to cliff vesting, the number of shares that may be earned ranges between 0% (if the specified threshold
performance level is not attained) and 200% (if performance meets or exceeds the maximum achievement level) of the awards originally granted. If actual
performance exceeds the pre-established threshold, the number of shares earned is calculated based on the relative performance between specified levels of
achievement.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Market-based RSUs
The Company grants cliff vesting RSU awards to its senior executives and other key employees, which, in addition to being subject to continuing
employment requirements (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the
awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed), are also subject to a market condition based on a TSR performance metric. The number of
shares that vest upon the completion of a three-year period of time is determined by comparing the Company's TSR relative to that of a pre-established peer
group over the related three-year performance period. Depending on the Company's level of achievement against its TSR performance goals, the number of
shares that ultimately vest may range from 0% to 200% of the awards originally granted.
The Company estimates the fair value of its TSR awards on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation, which models multiple stock price paths
of the Company's Class A common stock and that of its peer group to evaluate and determine its ultimate expected relative TSR performance
ranking. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately
satisfied.
The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of TSR awards granted were as follows:

19.    Employee Benefit Plans
Defined Contribution Plans
The Company sponsors defined contribution benefit plans covering substantially all eligible employees in the U.S.  and Puerto Rico who are not
covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The plans include a savings plan feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company
makes matching contributions to the plans equal to 50% of the first 6% of salary contributed by an eligible employee. Additionally, the Company makes a
supplemental matching contribution for plan years in which the Company achieves a "target or above" performance level based on certain goals established at
the beginning of each fiscal year, increasing the matching contribution to between 67% and 100% depending on the performance level achieved, of the first
6% of salary contributed by eligible employees, not to exceed the maximum contribution permitted by the plan.
Under the terms of the plans, a participant becomes 100% vested in the Company's matching contributions after five years of credited service.
Contributions made by the Company under these plans were $15.6 million, $10.0 million, and $8.3 million in Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023,
respectively.
International Defined Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors certain single-employer defined benefit plans and cash balance plans at international locations which are not considered to be
material individually or in the aggregate to the Company's financial statements. Pension benefits under these plans are based on formulas that reflect the
employees' years of service and compensation levels during their employment period.
The aggregate funded status of the single-employer defined benefit plans reflected net liabilities of $5.7 million and $4.4 million as of March 29, 2025
and March 30, 2024, respectively, and were primarily recorded within other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. These single-employer
defined benefit plans had aggregate fair values of plan assets of $53.9 million and aggregate projected benefit obligations of $59.6 million as of March 29,
2025, compared to aggregate fair values of plan assets of $46.1 million and aggregate projected benefit obligations of $50.5 million as of March 30, 2024.
The asset portfolio of the single-employer defined benefit plans primarily consists of fixed income and equity securities, which have been measured at fair
value largely using Level 2 inputs, as described in Note 12.
Net pension expense for these plans was $5.0 million, $5.0 million, and $3.9 million in Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively. The
service cost component of $5.9 million, $5.1 million, and $4.2 million in Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively, was recorded within SG&A
expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. All other components of net pension expense during the fiscal years presented were recorded within
other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statement of operations.

20.    Segment Information
The Company has three reportable segments based on its business activities and organization:
•
North America — The North America segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear & accessories, home, and
related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses primarily in the U.S. and Canada. In North America, the
Company's retail business is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its outlet stores, and its digital commerce sites,
www.RalphLauren.com and www.RalphLauren.ca. The Company's wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to
department stores and, to a lesser extent, specialty stores.
•
Europe — The Europe segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear & accessories, home, and related products
made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in Europe and emerging markets. In Europe, the Company's retail business is
primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its outlet stores, its concession-based shop-within-shops, and its various digital commerce sites.
The Company's wholesale business in Europe is comprised primarily of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores,
depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital and licensee partners.
•
Asia — The Asia segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear & accessories, home, and related products
made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. The Company's retail business in Asia is
primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its outlet stores, its concession-based shop-within-shops, and its various digital commerce sites.
In addition, the Company sells its products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. The Company's wholesale business
in Asia is comprised primarily of sales to department stores and various third-party digital and licensee partners.
No operating segments were aggregated to form the Company's reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company also has
other non-reportable segments, which primarily consist of Ralph Lauren and Chaps branded royalty revenues earned through its global licensing alliances.
The Company's segment reporting structure is consistent with how it establishes its overall business strategy, allocates resources, and assesses
performance of its business. The accounting policies of the Company's segments are consistent with those described in Notes 2 and 3. Sales and transfers
between segments are generally recorded at cost and treated as transfers of inventory. All intercompany revenues are eliminated in consolidation and are not
reviewed when evaluating segment performance. The Company's CODM, who is its President and Chief Executive Officer, assesses segment performance
and allocates resources based upon net revenues and operating income before restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other non-
routine items, if any. In addition, the Company's CODM is regularly provided each segment's gross profit and total SG&A expenses, as well as SG&A
expense by category at the consolidated level. Certain corporate overhead expenses related to global functions, most notably the Company's executive office,
information technology, finance and accounting, human resources, and legal departments, largely remain at corporate. Additionally, other costs that cannot be
allocated to the segments based on specific usage are also maintained at corporate, including corporate marketing and advertising expenses, depreciation and
amortization of corporate assets, and other general and administrative expenses resulting from corporate-level activities and projects. Asset information by
segment is not utilized by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance or allocating resources, and therefore such information has not been presented.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Ralph Lauren Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ralph Lauren Corporation (the Company) as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024,
the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 29,
2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 29, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of March  29, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated May  22, 2025 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved
our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the
critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
End-of-season Markdown Reserves
Description of the
Matter
As disclosed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, estimates for end-of-season markdown reserves are based on
historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, retailer
performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms.

Auditing management's estimate of end-of-season markdown reserves was complex and judgmental as reserve amounts are
sensitive to changes in market or economic conditions and have a direct, material impact on the amount of revenue recognized
by the Company. There is also significant estimation required to establish markdown reserve rates by brand and customer,
which are based on the Company's review of the seasonal negotiations with each customer and the expected performance of the
products in the customers' stores.
F-53


================================================================================
[PAGE 135 OF 144]
================================================================================
How We Addressed
the Matter in Our
Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the
Company's process to calculate the end-of-season markdown reserves, including the consideration of historical experience,
actual and forecasted seasonal results, current economic and market conditions, retailer performance, and contractual terms as
applicable.
 
To test the estimate of end-of-season markdown reserves, we performed audit procedures that included, among others,
assessing methodologies and testing the assumptions regarding seasonal negotiations with each customer which include the
application of market and economic conditions to individual customers and the expected performance of the products in the
customers' stores that were used by the Company to calculate the projected markdown allowances to be issued upon settlement.
We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current market and economic trends, historical results and
other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of
significant assumptions to substantively test the changes in the estimate that would result from reasonable changes in the
assumptions.
Estimated Realizable Value of Inventory
Description of the
Matter
As of March 29, 2025, the Company's net inventory balance was $949.6 million. As described in Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements, the valuation of inventory requires management to make assumptions and judgments about the
recoverability of inventory and its estimated realizable value.
The estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends, market trends and
economic conditions, future sales forecasts, on-hand inventory quantities, and consideration of the value of existing customer
orders for future sales of inventory. Given the importance of inventory to the Company's operations and the materiality of the
balance, coupled with the judgment involved in estimating future sales, auditing management's estimated realizable value
involved a higher extent of testing and the involvement of more senior members of the engagement team in executing,
supervising and reviewing the results of the procedures.
How We Addressed
the Matter in Our
Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the process to
determine the estimated realizable value of inventory, including controls over the inputs and assumptions used in management's
calculation as described above.
Our audit procedures to test the estimated realizable value of inventory included, among others, evaluating the appropriateness
of management's inputs to the calculation, including testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in management's
calculation such as historical sales activity and loss rates for each class of inventory, write-off activity, on-hand inventory levels
and inventory aging. To evaluate management's ability to accurately estimate future sales projections, which is also a key factor
in the determination of the reserve, we retrospectively reviewed actual sales compared to projections. We also tested the
mathematical accuracy of the Company's calculation.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Ralph Lauren Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Ralph Lauren Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of March 29, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
In our opinion, Ralph Lauren Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
March 29, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 29, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated May 22, 2025 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
