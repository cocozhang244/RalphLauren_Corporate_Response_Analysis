A Message from Our Chairman and CEO
Since our founding 57 years ago, Ralph Lauren has stood for timelessness — 
creating beautiful, quality pieces that are made to be worn, loved and passed 
on to the next generation. Our vision for timelessness not only inspires what 
we create but also how we create it — including how we operate our global 
business and engage with the communities where we operate. We do this 
because, like our iconic styles, we want our business to stand the test of time.
Guided by our Purpose — to inspire the dream of a better life through 
authenticity and timeless style — we advance this work by testing, learning, 
collaborating and scaling programs to reduce our dependence on limited 
natural resources, engage and inspire our global teams, and to enrich the 
communities where we operate — because when they thrive, we thrive. 
Some highlights from this year include:
•	 Creating timeless products with innovative materials and manufacturing 
processes including our Cradle to Cradle (C2C) Certified® Denim Flag 
Trucker Jacket, our first-ever Global Recycled Standard (GRS) certified 
100% Recycled Cotton Polo and our first collection of Responsible Wool 
Standard (RWS)-certified sweaters;
•	 Launching our Artist in Residence program with Diné (Navajo) artisan 
Naiomi Glasses to deliver beautiful, authentic products based on a  
first-of-its-kind model for mutually-beneficial cultural collaboration; 
•	 Continuing to phase out the use of coal in our supply chain and 
decreasing our absolute emissions against FY20 baseline with a 33% 
reduction; and
•	 Celebrating the newest Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Prevention, 
which will open in Fall 2024 at the University of Southern California, 
Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center.
As a Company, and as an industry, we have much more to do, but we are 
committed to progressing this important work that supports business 
longevity and creates value for all of our stakeholders. Thank you to our teams 
and partners whose leadership, dedication and creativity are represented 
throughout the pages of this report.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our Global Citizenship 
& Sustainability Approach 
For 57 years, we have created products that are timeless — that can be 
worn, loved and passed on through generations. Our Global Citizenship & 
Sustainability (GC&S) strategy, Timeless by Design, is grounded in this 
philosophy and how we embed our Company’s Purpose throughout  
our business.
Our 2024 GC&S Report outlines progress on our goals and commitments.  
This is brought to life through our three pillars:

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Create with Intent
Timelessness has always defined the creative vision for our products — today, 
this ethos extends to how we create and the stories we tell, and includes our 
work to embed inclusivity and incorporate circular principles into our design 
processes, enabling our products to live on from generation to generation. 
Protect the Environment
When we shift toward practices that take less from our planet, we can 
be stewards in protecting our environment for generations to come. In 
addition to creating products more responsibly, in our business operations 
we are transitioning to renewable energy, diverting waste from landfill and 
incineration and efficiently managing water use.
Champion Better Lives
Shaping a business that is timeless and has a positive impact for years to 
come means building relationships that stand the test of time and focusing on 
causes and actions that simultaneously benefit our communities, our teams 
and our Company. That’s why we’re committed to supporting our employees, 
our partners and those within our communities — working to help people 
thrive today and build a brighter future for tomorrow.
SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT GOALS
Through our work, we aim 
to address global priorities, 
contribute to tangible solutions 
and move closer to achieving 
targets. To align our approach 
to global efforts, elements of 
Timeless by Design support 
the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). 
Ralph Lauren’s current 
programs, metrics and policies 
were benchmarked against  
all 17 SDGs to identify and 
determine where the Company 
has the biggest opportunity to 
contribute to the SDGs:

Our Approach 
Our ethos of timelessness has always guided our creative vision. Guided by 
this philosophy, we are evolving the way our products are designed, made, 
used and recirculated. 
Our circularity strategy has three main focus areas:
•	 Designing and making products through the lens of circular principles
•	 Connecting consumers to services that enable product longevity  
and reuse
•	 Investing in circular systems and innovation across the industry
Integrated Circularity
2030 GOAL

responsibly — underpins our vision for a more circular fashion industry. 
This includes creating products that are made with future uses in mind and 
connecting consumers with solutions that help improve and extend the life 
of their garments.

Our Actions
Designing for Timelessness
Our circular design principles, developed through collaborative cross-
functional engagement, are intended to support our design and product 
development teams to create products that can live on for generations  
to come.
Cradle to Cradle Certified®
This past year, we certified two additional icons – the luxury Flag Cashmere 
Sweater and the Polo Denim Flag Trucker Jacket, our third and fourth 
products to be C2C Certified® Gold. The jacket is also made with 75% 
Regenagri® certified cotton and 25% recycled cotton and has removable 
buttons to enable recycling at the end of the product’s life cycle. These 
products follow the launch of our initial C2C Certified® Gold products,  
the classic, luxury Cashmere Crewneck Sweater and luxury Cashmere 
Turtleneck Sweater.
C2C certification is the global standard for products that are safe and circular. 
Ralph Lauren partnered with an independent assessment body to ensure 
every component of these four products met the C2C Certified® Product 
Standards set by the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute (C2CPII).

The cashmere sweater and denim trucker jacket are excellent 
examples that show C2C Certified® collections look fantastic while 
adhering to all stringent environmental and social requirements of the 
product standard. We are proud to have Ralph Lauren as a partner 
in our program, and we celebrate these outstanding results as we 
eagerly anticipate the upcoming new icons.

Ellen MacArthur Foundation
Launched this year, our unisex, classic fit jean and trucker jacket were 
developed to meet the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s The Jeans Redesign 
guidelines, which were created through the collaborative project that took 
place from 2019-2023. Crafted with features like removable metal buttons 
and a rivet-free design, the jean and trucker jacket were made for recyclability 
at the end of their usable life. Both products include recycled cotton. Since 
2021, we have been a Network Partner of the Foundation, participating in 
collaborative engagements to further a shift to a circular economy throughout 
our industry.
Enable Circular Consumer Experiences
To help extend the life of Ralph Lauren products we are helping consumers 
make conscious decisions when buying, maintaining or parting ways with  
their items. 
Ralph Lauren customers can access our products on several rental platforms, 
including Rent the Runway. This enables consumers to rent items for a one-
time event or as part of an ongoing subscription. 
We are launching a recycling program for 100% cashmere garments in 
partnership with Re-Verso™, which was developed as part of the C2C 
certification process for our C2C Certified® Gold Cashmere Sweater. 
We are also engaging with the resale market by selling curated collections of 
iconic, vintage Ralph Lauren products. These collections can be found on our 
digital platforms and in select stores.

88 million 
digital product IDs activated in FY24
DISTRIBUTED AND AUTHENTICATED RESALE NETWORK
The World Economic Forum (WEF), Ralph Lauren, Vestiaire Collective 
and Digimarc (formerly EVRYTHNG), in collaboration with Bain & 
Company, launched a pilot to support the authentication of fashion 
products in the secondhand market through digital ID technology. This 
pilot established a global collaboration between manufacturers and brand 
owners, suppliers, consumer representatives and regulators, enabling richer 
consumer experiences in secondhand marketplaces.
The first phase of the pilot, completed in FY24, focused on designing 
the digital architecture and testing it with limited stakeholders. Now in 
its second phase, the pilot has been extended to multiple marketplaces, 
brands and technology providers. The working group will build a framework 
establishing an open standard, which helps demonstrate the power  
of collaboration.
Advance a Circular Economy
We consider the entire life cycle of our products and invest in innovative, 
scalable solutions to help deliver the quality our consumers expect.  
This includes leveraging authentication and digital traceability tools to 
demonstrate transparency.
Digital Product ID (DPID)
We have offered DPID since 2019 as a way for consumers to verify the 
authenticity and details of their Ralph Lauren product easily and seamlessly. 
With more than 300 million individual items equipped with DPIDs, we 
are continuing to leverage DPID to identify counterfeiters and to ensure 
customers can easily report fraudulent products to us. Looking ahead, 
Ralph Lauren has developed DPID to enable future integration of additional 
functionality, such as enhanced product traceability and transparency 
information, as well as product information that can help reduce the need  
for excess hangtags.

Our Approach 
We craft our products to stand the test of time and to live on responsibly. 
We seek to use materials that help to address our environmental impact

customers expect. We focus our efforts on the key materials that make up 
the chief content of 94% of our apparel units: cotton, polyester, wool, viscose, 
down1, tanned leather and cashmere. 
We are committed to sourcing materials certified to credible third-party 
standards and working towards increasing traceability across our supply 
chain. For more on our approach and progress around transparency and 
traceability, see the Value Chain for Impact section of this report.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Key Materials
The material development and sourcing teams who work directly with our 
finished goods suppliers embed sustainability as a key component of their 
strategy. We had some noteworthy achievements this year, particularly in our 
cotton and animal-derived material programs, and our core apparel programs 
continue to have sustainable content.
Cotton
Cotton is the most widely used natural fiber for clothing production2 and is the 
chief content in approximately 80% of our product units. In FY24, 97% of the 
cotton apparel units we produced met at least one of our defined sustainability 
attributes (organic, transitional/in-conversion, Better Cotton, recycled, 
regenerative, U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol or Fair Trade-certified). Through 
the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund (USRCF), The Ralph Lauren Corporate 
Foundation also supports the increased adoption of regenerative practices, 
such as reduced tillage and cover cropping. For more information on the USRCF, 
see the Community Engagement & Philanthropy section of this report.
Polyester
Polyester is the chief content in 6.5% of our apparel units and is critical 
to performance in certain categories, such as outerwear, swim or certain 
types of knit shirts. In FY24, 87% of our polyester apparel units had a 
sustainability attribute. We have successfully transitioned our core programs 
from conventional to recycled polyester and are focused on addressing the 
challenges to transition the remaining units.
Wool
The Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) is a certification focused on 
protecting animal welfare and promoting progressive methods of land 
management at the farm level. As wool moves through the supply chain, the 
RWS Content Claim Standard ensures a strong chain of custody is in place at 
every stage so the consumer can be confident the finished product contains 
wool from an RWS-certified farm. In FY24, 92% of our chief content wool 
apparel products were RWS or recycled wool.
Our first fully certified RWS sweaters were launched in our Fall 2023 Polo 
collection. This included more than 900,000 units spanning 160 styles across 
our Polo men’s, women’s and children’s, RLX and Lauren brands. We were 
proud to provide the Paris 2024 Olympic Team USA with blazers crafted from 
USA-grown RWS-certified wool for the Opening Ceremony.
Viscose
Viscose and other man-made cellulosic fibers (MMCF) are used in only 0.4% of 
the apparel units we produce. These materials are typically made from trees, 
which presents a risk of sourcing inputs from ancient and endangered forests.

the world’s forests. Their tool, the Hot Button Report, is the fashion sector’s 
primary tool to identify the sourcing practices of MMCF manufacturers. Our 
material sourcing team requests that our suppliers only use viscose and other 
MMCFs from “green shirt” manufacturers, those who score highest on the 
CanopyStyle audit. In FY24, 78% of our yarn and fabric suppliers reported that 
they sourced MMCF from green shirt manufacturers.
Down
We started using Responsible Down Standard (RDS) virgin down in 2019  
and have only used 100% RDS-certified down in apparel since 2023. RDS  
is a globally recognized standard that aims to improve the welfare of ducks 
and geese used for down and feathers and provides confidence that the  
chain of custody was intact through the supply chain. Marketing the use of 
RDS-certified down on a specific product requires every member of the value 
chain be certified and the usage validated. As part of our Fall and Holiday 
2024 Polo outerwear collection, we are offering nearly 400,000 units of RDS-
certified products across 90 styles for our men’s, women’s and children’s lines.
Tanned Leather
In FY24, we continued making progress towards our goal of sourcing all of 
our tanned leather from Leather Working Group (LWG)-certified tanneries, 
achieving a total of 90%. LWG seeks to drive best practices and positive 
environmental and social change in leather production; the cornerstone of its 
efforts is the LWG Leather Manufacture Audit Standard, which assesses the 
environmental impact of leather production at the facility level. 
As part of our Fall 2023 footwear collection, we offered our first shoes  
made with regenerative leather. The Polo Camp shoes were crafted using 
leather and suede processed in the U.S., sourced from farms and ranches 
that use regenerative grazing practices, such as high-density, short-duration 
grazing. Traceability in the leather supply chain continues to be an industry-
wide challenge. 
We see opportunity in changing systems at the beginning of the supply chain. 
This year we continued to support the Leather Impact Accelerator (LIA), a set 
of tools developed by Textile Exchange focused on enabling key stakeholders 
— from farmers to retailers — to foster the development of a more responsible 
leather supply chain. These tools individually establish minimum social, 
environmental and animal welfare thresholds for practices at the farm and 
leather production levels and give recognition to producers who meet them. 
Cashmere 
We are focused on sourcing Sustainable Fibre Alliance (SFA)-certified virgin 
or recycled cashmere, which typically comes from post-consumer recycled 
textiles or pre-consumer industrial waste. In FY24, 85% of our chief content 
cashmere product was SFA-certified or recycled. As part of our annual Textile 
Exchange Brand Certification audit in 2024, we added SFA certification to 
We are committed to ensuring 
our products are ethically made 
and adhere to our strict and 
robust Animal Welfare Policy, 
which outlines clear sourcing 
guidelines and requirements for 
all animal-based raw materials.

Our Actions
We continue to prioritize collaboration with innovative startups to help 
us create new, high-quality materials that can also help us reduce our 
environmental footprint. We are also exploring various recycling solutions  
that are focused on disassembly, decolorization, separation and re-creation. 
By partnering globally, we can help support the creation of processes that 
allow materials and products to be recycled at scale. 
Innovation
We are committed to investing in and using innovative materials to decrease 
our reliance on virgin raw materials. As part of the 2024 Team USA Olympics 
Villagewear collection, we were proud to introduce the 100% Recycled 
Cotton CLARUS® Polo Shirt. We’ve reimagined our most iconic product 
using CLARUS® welding technology. The shirt is crafted with performance 
attributes, including less pilling and shrinkage over time, while still retaining 
the comfort of our signature cotton Polo.
CLARUS® was developed by NFW. We have invested in NFW’s innovative 
solutions to enable us to reduce our reliance on virgin raw materials and 
advance a more circular fashion industry. 
In addition, we are focused on yarn and process optimization for post-
industrial recycled cotton. As part of this work and to help reduce waste, we 
are building recycling hubs within our sourcing regions to deliver high-quality, 
viable yarns. We currently have pilots in Turkey and Bangladesh and are 
exploring opportunities to scale in select top regions in FY25.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our Approach
Since our founding, Ralph Lauren’s design ethos has been inspired by the 
beautiful and interconnected histories, arts, crafts and cultures that make 
up the fabric of America. Mindful of our efforts to expand our portrayal of 
America, we’re on a journey to evolve from inspiration to collaboration with 
communities that inspire us. That includes taking meaningful steps to be more 
inclusive throughout our business, from how we design to how products go to 
market. We are developing and embedding principles of culturally sustainable 
design into our product creation processes, supporting the preservation 
of traditional craft and driving economic and social impact within artisan 
communities. At its core, Design with Intent is about making sure the products 
we create and the stories we tell are authentic expressions of heritage, which 
is foundational to our timeless brand.
Formally launched in 2022, our Design with Intent department guides and 
operationalizes Ralph Lauren’s culturally sustainable design and go-to-market 
execution with a focus on:
•	 Leading internal education efforts about culturally cognizant design
•	 Creating and actioning a model for mutually beneficial cultural 
collaborations 
•	 Driving community and artisan engagement 
•	 Establishing a network of external resources to advise on our efforts
Our Actions
Cultural Collaboration Models
To help enable our shift from inspiration to collaboration, we are building 
and refining two models for collaboration with the communities that own and 
sustain heritage craft: our Artist in Residence program and our Authentic 
Makers program.
Both models are intended to be mutually beneficial exchanges, combining 
the unique skill of the artisan with our core brand sensibilities. They also aim 
to recognize the broader communal ownership of the craft and design motifs 
represented within collaborations. We are grateful to have received third-party 
counsel to help guide us in building models that are fair, replicable and may be 
refined as we learn more with each collaboration.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Artist in Residence Program
Through our Artist in Residence program, we invite artisans working with a 
variety of skill sets, mediums and materials to collaborate with Ralph Lauren’s 
design teams.
Our first focus is on partnering with Indigenous artisans, but this is intended 
to be an ongoing program where we will seek to collaborate with those who 
authentically connect to and inspire us. Acknowledging the broader communal 
ownership of the traditional expression utilized within these product 
collaborations, we work closely with each Artist in Residence to identify a 
beneficiary organization serving members of their community, to which a 
portion of collaboration product sales will be donated.
Authentic Makers Program
Ralph Lauren’s Authentic Makers program invites artisans to create a product 
collaboration with our design teams and manufacture the product using 
traditional techniques. While the program is still in its early stages, we have 
engaged in several small-scale Authentic Makers collaborations, including:
•	 A collection of special-edition concho belts for our women’s Collection 
made by silversmith Jimmy Begay Jr. (Diné/Navajo).
•	 A special-edition collaboration with Ishi Glinsky (Tohono O’odham 
Nation) using traditional hand tattooing techniques to adorn USA-made 
leather moccasins.
Navajo weaving is a craft that has carried on through my family 
for seven generations and preserving these traditions in new 
ways has been so inspiring to me as an artist. To now be able to 
share it with people around the world, as seen through my eyes 
and brought to life in clothing, is a dream come true. It is only 
through the power of collaboration and Ralph Lauren’s unique 
program that this collection was made possible, and the best part 
is that it brings traditional Navajo weaving to a new generation.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Cultural Cognizance
Our Design with Intent work is founded upon continued education — 
deepening our understanding of the communities that inspire us and 
relearning how to use cultural inspirations respectfully and inclusively.
Education
Our Cultural Awareness Guidelines support our approach to culturally 
cognizant product creation and storytelling across the Company. We update 
these regularly according to emerging best practices and guidance from our 
network of external advisors and distribute them to all teams with a role in 
design, merchandising, advertising and marketing. We inform and prepare 
these teams to apply our guidelines through mandatory cultural awareness 
educational programs.
We also remain dedicated to providing next-generation leaders with 
opportunities to access education. The Company continues to support 
scholarship programs via the American Indian College Fund and launched a 
two-year Master of Fine Arts scholarship at the Institute of American Indian 
Arts (IAIA), aiming to support Indigenous talent in creative fields of work. 
Additionally, we supported IAIA as a sponsor of its 2023 benefit event with 
proceeds going toward their general scholarship fund. 
Cultural Consultants and Liaisons
Our Cultural Awareness Council (the Council) enables progress by 
working cross-functionally to create and implement culturally sustainable 
policies, guidelines and best practices. The Council is made up of team 
members across disciplines including Legal/Cultural IP, DE&I, Corporate 
Communications and Design with Intent. They participate in weekly review 
sessions to ensure cultural responsibility practices are maintained from 
products’ conception through their go-to-market campaigns. This year, the 
Council expanded to include team members from our EMEA and APAC regions 
to ensure global and regional perspectives are represented.
Employee Impact Group (EIG) leaders and external cultural and textile 
experts are consulted as needed to help inform our decision making and  
development of authentic partnerships, programs and storytelling. Our 
External Native and Indigenous Advisory Council includes Indigenous leaders 
across cultural, historical, educational, legal, media and creative disciplines. 
The group reviews and provides guidance on our Design with Intent work.
The Design with Intent team also engages in continuous education, which 
has included training with Cultural Intellectual Property Rights Initiative 
and partnering with Legal and Learning and Development teams to host 
sessions on Cultural Intellectual Property and Traditional Cultural Expression. 
Additionally, Design teams are also able to access global textile expertise to 
understand textile histories, origins and provenance via our extended network.
CULTURAL ENGAGEMENT
A critical part of our work is 
building relationships based 
on respect and trust with the 
communities that inspire us. We 
regularly seek opportunities to 
connect with Native community 
leaders and Indigenous-serving 
organizations to apply greater 
cultural cognizance to our work 
and scale our impact.

In December 2023, Ralph Lauren launched the inaugural collection of the Company’s Artist in Residence program, 
Polo Ralph Lauren x Naiomi Glasses – a collaboration with seventh-generation Diné (Navajo) textile artist 
and weaver Naiomi Glasses. Over the past two years, Glasses worked with the Polo Ralph Lauren design teams 
to reimagine her original weaving designs into three capsule collections inspired by her family, homelands and 
community on Dinétah (Navajo Nation). To accompany each collection, she curated one-of-a-kind silver and 
turquoise jewelry pieces, handmade by renowned artisans from the Navajo Nation, Hopi Pueblo, San Felipe Pueblo 
and Zuni Pueblo. 
Unveiled as three seasonal, special-edition product launches through Fall 2024, this collection celebrates the artistry 
of timeless Navajo traditions from Naiomi’s perspective. A beautiful, 360˚ campaign promoting each collection was 
showcased across Ralph Lauren’s channels, including a docuseries, two episodes of which were directed by award-
winning filmmaker Shaandiin Tome (Diné/Navajo). Drops one and two of the campaign were shot by Ryan RedCorn 
(Osage Nation), alongside photography from Daryn Sells (Diné/Navajo) and Lonnie Begay (Diné/Navajo). All three 
drops featured many Native and Indigenous models, including friends and family of Naiomi Glasses. 
As an avid turquoise and silver collector, Naiomi curated a unique selection of handcrafted pieces by several 
renowned jewelry makers from Navajo Nation, Hopi Pueblo, San Felipe Pueblo and Zuni Pueblo, showcased 
throughout the campaign and profiled in a piece in RL Magazine, guest written by Sheyenne Sky Lacy (Diné/Navajo). 
Special handmade silver and turquoise pieces from the artisans were available for purchase online and in select 
flagship stores.
Ralph Lauren’s External Native and Indigenous Advisory Council advised the Company on the ideation, approach 
and creation of the campaign, as part of its ongoing role to share guidance on Ralph Lauren’s representation of and 
engagement with Indigenous communities. Additionally, a portion of the sales of the Polo Ralph Lauren x Naiomi 
Glasses collection support organizations serving communities within the Navajo Nation and beyond.

Our Approach
To build a resilient and responsible value chain, we are continuing to create 
transparency and traceability, strengthen relationships with partners in our 
ecosystem and identify areas for improvement. We are also working with our 
suppliers to respect human rights and promote environmental sustainability.
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) work is a vital part of this, and we 
started in FY20 with our Tier 1 suppliers and in FY23 expanded the program 
to our Tier 2 suppliers. Our work in supplier engagement helps create an 
agile and resilient value chain ecosystem that can respond to disruption and 
change while meeting our shared and individual goals. We continue to progress 
towards our goal to conduct 80% of our business with suppliers that meet 
strategic and key supplier criteria, which includes business, quality, citizenship 
and sustainability performance. In FY24, 56% of our business was with 
suppliers that met the strategic and key supplier criteria. For more information 
on our procurement practices, refer to our Supply Chain and Product 
Sustainability Policy and our Supplier Engagement Strategy.

Our Actions
Transparency and Traceability 
Enhancing transparency and traceability across our value chain is 
foundational to the successful implementation of our GC&S strategy and 
achievement of our goals. It enables us to better understand our impacts, 
improve compliance with social and environmental requirements throughout 
the value chain and track our progress more accurately. We are committed  
to continuously improving both transparency in global supply chains and  
the traceability of our products across our value chains. To support this, 
we have created a strong internal governance system and are investing in a 
combination of tools and processes that target different aspects of this work 
in addition to exploring new technologies as they become available.
Transparency
In order to map and disclose our supplier partners, we use Open Supply Hub 
to publish the name, location and parent company of Tier 1 value-adding 
processing units including sewing, washing, embroidery and printing facilities. 
The list is updated as needed and was last updated on April 24, 2024.
In FY24, we worked with 378 active Tier 1 factories across 31 countries. In 
addition to finished goods factories, we continued to disclose Tier 1 processing 
units. We had 190 active processing units for finished goods factories. Overall, 
FY24 disclosures included 94% of business coverage.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Traceability
Tracking products and their inputs across the value chain from source 
to shelf is emerging as a regulatory requirement globally. This is possible 
through digital traceability (e.g., chain of custody) and physical traceability 
(e.g., trackers and fiber verification). Traceability also supports our 
efforts to achieve 100% sustainably sourced key materials (as described 
in the Sustainable Materials section of this report). To standardize 
and communicate our expectations around verifiable chain of custody 
documentation, we created a Transparency & Traceability Playbook for our 
suppliers, providing clear definitions, training and tools for support. 
Responsible Purchasing Practices 
We are addressing the role we play in being a responsible buyer by continuing 
our commitment to responsible purchasing practices (RPP). Since 2021, we 
have leveraged the Better Buying Survey to help us further understand the 
impact of our business practices on factories and workers. This supplier 
feedback creates an ongoing opportunity for collaborative problem solving. 
We leverage our Better Buying Survey results through cross-functional 
working groups covering five categories: planning and forecasting, design and 
development, cost and negotiations, sourcing and order management and 
win-win sustainable partnership. These working groups identify improvement 
areas and create metrics to continuously evaluate and improve our RPP. As a 
result of this work, in FY24 we expanded our Supply Chain Financing strategy 
to include additional banking partners to facilitate further competition and 
provide suppliers with more choices to ensure they receive competitive 
pricing. Additionally, we are collaborating with the banking partners to 
establish preferential financing rates to incentivize suppliers who have better 
performance as defined through our SES.
We continue to conduct mandatory training in these practices for our buying 
and sourcing teams. We connect with our industry peers to benchmark 
our progress, as well as review standards and expectations from non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) to identify opportunities for continuously 
improving our RPP. With this in mind, we are in the process of developing a 
Responsible Purchasing Practices Policy and corresponding guidelines. 
Supplier Engagement
We engage suppliers through two-way communication, sharing our 
expectations and seeking feedback on how to strengthen our overall 
partnership via strategies: one-on-one check-ins, roundtable discussions, our 
Supplier Engagement Scorecard, surveys (including the Better Buying Survey) 
and semi-annual supplier summits. 
BETTER BUYING SURVEY
In FY24, the suppliers who  
joined the survey covered 
86% of value and 88% of unit 
volume of our business. In total, 
104 suppliers participated in 
the survey which is 9% more 
compared to last year.
Our suppliers recognized our 
year-over-year improvements 
in the areas of payment terms, 
management of purchasing 
practices as well as win-win 
sustainable partnership. Based 
on our suppliers’ feedback, 
we will continue to focus on 
improvements for planning  
and forecasting.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
We have also created a Supplier Innovation Council, which is a group of key 
and strategic suppliers that meet our innovation criteria and share innovative 
practices and solutions collaboratively. We present this cross-supplier forum 
with startups and new technologies, which they then test, if interested, then 
share their results to enable scaling in their production.
Supplier Engagement Scorecard
Our Supplier Engagement Scorecard has social and environmental 
performance indicators that enable us to communicate our sustainability 
expectations, evaluate and monitor the progress of our suppliers and 
strengthen collaboration. This includes the use of industry tools, including 
the Higg Facility Environment Module (FEM), Better Work and Social Labor 
Convergence Project (SLCP), Aii Carbon Toolkit, ZDHC chemical monitoring 
tools, as well as the tracking of sustainable material certifications and 
resource-efficient production practices to ensure alignment between 
our sourcing strategy and our goals. In FY24, we diversified our social 
key performance indicators (KPIs) within the scorecard to align with key 
areas: career advancement for workers, wage management and effective 
grievance mechanisms. This year, we also digitized our scorecards, which 
provides better efficiency and helps us build real time data; and we added 
Transparency and Traceability KPIs.
We collected Higg FEM data from 276 Tier 1 facilities, representing 92% of 
our supply chain spend. Among the reporting facilities, 263 facilities (91% of 
business volume) have completed data verification by verifiers approved by 
Cascale (formerly known as Sustainable Apparel Coalition). Facilities scored 
an average of 63 points across all sections (out of 100), with an average of 
72 points in the water section, 26 points in chemical management section 
and 81 in the energy section. For raw material manufacturing, Higg FEM data 
collection covers 119 mills, representing our woven, knit and sweater yarn 
production. A total of 115 mills have completed data verification, representing 
an estimated 62% of core fabric business volume. The mills scored an average 
of 69 points across all sections (out of 100), with an average of 71 points in the 
water section, 28 points in the chemical management section and 83 points 
in the energy section. This year, we have significantly increased our FEM 
roll out to our subcontracted finished goods facilities; a total of 131 facilities 
completed FEM and 125 facilities completed third-party verification. These 
facilities scored an average of 60 points across all sections (out of 100), 
with an average of 71 points in the water section, 28 points in the chemical 
management section and 82 points in the energy section.
WORKING WITH 
LICENSEES
In addition to our own  
products, we license the 
Ralph Lauren brands to select 
companies. We extend our 
GC&S expectations and 
standards to licensees and 
require them to have social 
compliance programs and 
standards equivalent to our  
own. We separately assess 
licensee supplier compliance 
programs and review their 
assessments to ensure that  
they meet our requirements.  
We are reviewing the licensee 
roadmaps for incorporating 
sustainable materials,  
packaging and chemical 
management and adopting 
energy and water efficiency  
and coal phase out plans. 
In FY24, 32 licensees used 
approximately 489 factories  
to make licensed products.

Our Approach 
The risks posed by climate change require us all to make significant reductions 
to global GHG emissions so we can protect and preserve our planet. 
Climate Strategy
To support our roadmap and targets, we have defined key strategies for 
reducing GHG emissions across our own operations and supply chain.
Climate
2040 GOAL
Achieve net zero GHG emissions 
across the value chain from a FY20 
base year
2030 GOAL
Reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 and 
3 GHG emissions by 30% from a 
FY20 base year (SBTi-approved) 
2025 GOAL
Power our owned and  
operated offices, distribution 
centers and stores with 100% 
renewable electricity
Achieving and maintaining our target of sourcing 100% 
renewable electricity for power used at our facilities
Increasing the share of low-carbon materials in our products 
(e.g., recycled fiber or regenerative cotton farming practices) 
Expanding and accelerating decarbonization practices with 
our product manufacturing suppliers, including supplier 
GHG reduction roadmap development and coal phase out
Prioritizing ocean freight and minimizing air freight to 
transport our products
Investing in our efforts to advance a circular  
fashion industry
Working with partners and action networks for  
industry-wide change
KEY DECARBONIZATION STRATEGIES
Collaboration across the industry — which is crucial to making impactful 
progress — is one of our strategies for reducing GHG emissions across 
our operations and supply chain. We participate in industry initiatives, 
including the United Nations Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, 
Apparel Impact Institute’s Carbon Leadership Program, Cascale, Fashion 
Pact, Clean Energy Buyers Alliance and RE100, among others. Through 
these collaborations, we gather expert insights to help inform actions for 
decarbonization, such as our goal to transition to renewable energy across  
our entire supply chain and shifting toward a more circular economy.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our Science-Based Target
To do our part in mitigating the effects of climate change, we have set an 
ambitious target to achieve net zero emissions across our value chain by 
2040. This target has interim goals: 
1.	 To power our owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores 
with 100% renewable electricity by the end of 2025 
2.	 To reduce our absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions by 30% by 2030 from a FY20 baseline year
Our 2030 goal has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi) and our net zero goal has been submitted for validation to SBTi.
Climate Risk
Climate-related risks pose challenges to our operations, our supply chain and 
how we manage the transition to a low-carbon economy. We address these 
risks with regular assessments and contingency planning. 
Our Board of Directors and CEO review climate-related risks and management 
strategies on at least an annual basis. We have established a Climate Risk 
Taskforce that meets semiannually to update our Climate Risk Report, 
identifying key physical and transitional climate risks, their likelihood of 
occurring, potential impact and actions being taken to manage each risk. This 
process includes assigning a risk rating to each potential threat based on its 
ability to inhibit our strategic or financial objectives under potential future 
climate scenarios.
Among the top climate risks identified by the Taskforce were:
•	 Physical risk from wind and flood to our operations and key 
manufacturing suppliers. We are responding by deploying crisis 
management teams to impacted owned and operated facilities to 
address extreme weather events, as well as diversifying and balancing 
our sourcing countries and supply locations. 
•	 Transitional risk from the cost and availability of cotton fiber and fabric. 
To address this risk, we are implementing a sourcing strategy focused on 
the use of sustainable materials, like organic and recycled cotton, and 
adopting energy- and water-efficient fabric production methods.
Our work to build greater transparency and traceability in our supply chain is 
critical to identifying and managing climate risk from raw material availability. 
Mapping this system will enable a more accurate measurement of our carbon 
footprint and a better understanding of where our physical risks lie. For more 
information about how we assess and plan for climate risk, see our CDP 2024 
Climate Change Disclosure and TCFD Index.

As we continue to pursue projects that will help us meet our 2025 target and 
bring additional renewable electricity to the grid, we are also seeking novel 
contract arrangements.
Renewable Electricity
In FY24, we signed a 10-year Collective Virtual Power Purchase Agreement 
(VPPA) with 12 other Fashion Pact members. The project, located in Spain, 
is expected to begin operating in 2026 and will match approximately 90% of 
our power consumption in Europe with renewable electricity. We also sourced 
renewable energy attribute certificates in North America, EMEA and APAC 
equivalent to 64% of our global power consumption in FY24.

LED Lighting
We have finished our LED lighting retrofits at two of our North Carolina 
distribution centers, which have resulted in a total building electricity 
reduction of 20% in FY24, compared to FY23. Once fully programmed and 
integrated, these retrofits are anticipated to decrease the total electricity 
used in the facilities by 35% and help avoid 6,300 pounds of fluorescent light 
waste each year. These projects are part of a larger push to achieve LEED 
certification for our distribution centers in FY25. 
Supply Chain Emissions
A significant portion of our emissions comes from our supply chain, so we 
work with suppliers to set and implement goals and plans to reduce their 
carbon footprint. We recognize that achieving global net zero emissions is a 
shared responsibility. In addition to addressing the impact within our value 
chain, we actively participate in and contribute to industry-wide collective 
movements. For example, we are members of the Steering Committee of 
the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action under the UNFCCC and 
participate in their Low Carbon Manufacturing working group and Policy 
working group. We are also an Apparel Impact Institute (Aii) Roundtable 
member, actively contributing to driving supply chain decarbonization efforts 
within our industry in a standardized and scalable manner.
The Carbon Leadership Program
In FY24, we continued our roll out of the Carbon Leadership Program (CLP) 
through our partnership with the Apparel Impact Institute (Aii). Through the 
Program, we provided funding for expert technical support for nominated 
manufacturing facilities to establish their 2030 carbon and water reduction 
plans in alignment with broader industry ambitions and best practices. We 
expanded our CLP roll out to cover 95 facilities, representing suppliers with 
approximately 48% of our core fabric business volume, including 28 finished 
goods facilities. The average carbon reduction targets committed to by all the 
nominated facilities so far is 63% by 2030 compared to a 2019 baseline. We 
continue to engage with facilities in the program quarterly to track and review 
the implementation progress through Aii’s Carbon Target Monitoring (CTM) work. 
PURSUING LEED 
CERTIFICATION 
In May 2024, our two 
Distribution Centers in North 
Carolina were awarded LEED 
Silver certification, the first  
of our facilities to achieve  
LEED certification.
LEED (Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design) is 
the internationally accepted 
benchmark for the design, 
construction and operation 
of high-performance green 
buildings and is a voluntary 
third-party rating system 
administered by the U.S. Green 
Building Council (USGBC).
These certifications were 
achieved as part of our 
continuous improvement 
initiatives, which include 
employee engagement and 
training, LED lighting retrofits 
with integrated sensor controls 
and operating with the Zero 
Waste program.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Renewable Energy
We are making progress toward transitioning our supply chain towards clean 
and renewable electricity. Based on the latest verified Higg FEM data, 8% 
of the electricity across Tier 1 and Tier 2 are from on-site and/or off-site 
renewable energy. We currently have 21 facilities in Bangladesh, Vietnam and 
Cambodia participating in on-site solar programs in partnership with Cascale 
and GIZ PDP. The program supports interested facilities in conducting  
pre-feasibility assessments, developing a business case for top management, 
and tendering and connecting suppliers to solar contractors and investors. 
Additionally, the program provides support throughout the implementation of 
on-site solar power. We also encourage capacity building on on-site/off-site 
renewable energy to our suppliers through Aii CLP.
Coal Phase Out
As we continue expanding visibility into our upstream value chain through 
transparency and traceability work, we are committed to identifying and 
working with suppliers to phase out on-site coal consumption. Our goal is to 
phase out coal from our Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturing facilities by the end of 
2025. We support our suppliers in this journey by enrolling them in programs 
to set GHG, energy and water reduction roadmaps. 
Globally, we have identified 74 active on-site coal-using facilities (Tier 1 and 
Tier 2), 35 of which have successfully phased out coal to date, with the rest on 
track to meet the 2025 goal. In November 2022, we ceased onboarding any new 
facilities with on-site coal. For the existing facilities with on-site coal usage that 
were onboarded prior to November 2022, we require written coal phase out 
commitments and action plans from facilities and track their progress quarterly. 
Transportation and Distribution
Our Scope 3 footprint includes emissions from product transport such as 
train, ocean, air and truck freight. To reduce costs and mitigate environmental 
impact, we prioritize efficiency when choosing how to transport products 
to our distribution centers. We only allow vendors to deliver products by 
air in rare circumstances, such as when production does not meet delivery 
deadlines. Our logistics provider selection process continues to include and 
consider candidates’ sustainability practices — from the presence of existing 
company sustainability strategy to working with some parcel carriers to 
develop performance measurement and continuous improvement plans.  
In FY24, air freight managed directly by us was 5.8% compared to 7.6% in 
FY23. This decrease was due to ongoing improvements in our buying practices 
and inventory strategy as well as fewer production delays.

Water in Our Supply Chain
Our industry depends on water for fiber crop irrigation, dyeing and  
washing in manufacturing and management of facilities. We continuously 
evaluate water use across our value chain, looking for ways to drive efficient 
water management and support our suppliers in setting and reaching water 
reduction goals.
We work with a third-party expert to analyze water hotspots in our supply 
chain and identify priority areas for improving water use practices in 
manufacturing and production. Based on the findings from the analysis 
conducted in FY24, it was identified that water use in our mills and vertical 
suppliers with wet processing constitutes a significant portion of our water 
footprint. Additionally, we leverage the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) water 
risk filter to help us prioritize and engage in targeted supplier engagement in 
reducing our water impact.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Water Efficiency
Our Company is committed to achieving a minimum 20% reduction in total 
water consumption throughout our operations and value chain by the end 
of 2025. In parallel, we continued our direct collaboration with suppliers to 
improve water management through the adoption of more water-efficient 
processing for our materials and product manufacturing. Over the past year, 
we continued to work with our suppliers to shift from traditional finishing 
setups to more water-efficient techniques where available. As a result of  
these processing choices, in FY24 we estimate the avoided use of 200,000 m3 
of water.
We have been actively seeking innovations, ranging from chemical to machine, 
that impact various phases of our products’ manufacturing life cycle. Notably, 
as the dyeing and finishing of cotton products are water intensive processes, 
we engage in trials with both startups and established companies to explore 
innovative solutions aimed at reducing water consumption across the 
pretreatment, dyeing and rinsing stages of product manufacturing. These 
innovations have the potential to substantially impact water usage, energy 
consumption and carbon emissions in our supply chain.
The Carbon Leadership Program
We continue to support our partners in setting facility-level water reduction 
targets through the Carbon Leadership Program, whereby nominated 
facilities set 2025 and 2030 water reduction targets, then create 
corresponding roadmaps to reach these goals. Based on the roadmaps 
developed and committed to by the nominated facilities, we estimate 
22 million m3 of aggregate water consumption could be saved annually by 
2030. Water efficiency projects have been identified as having the highest 
potential for reduction, followed by water recycling projects, which, on 
average, reduce freshwater usage by 16% and 13%, respectively. For example, 
specific actions such as using low liquor ratio baths for dyeing machines, 
reusing water in the dyeing system and retrofitting existing dyeing machines 
have been identified as the most effective water-saving measures. We also 
work closely with our suppliers to track progress and support capability 
building and collective action programs.
Supporting Improved Water Access and Management
Addressing water challenges across our value chain goes beyond water use 
in manufacturing, which is why our approach to water stewardship includes 
supporting organizations providing clean water for those in need and engaging 
in joint efforts to improve water management at scale.

& OVERVIEW
World Wildlife Fund Partnership
Through our ongoing partnership with World Wildlife Fund (WWF), we 
have regularly conducted comprehensive water risk analyses, enabling us 
to identify water-stressed basins in our supply chain, prioritize action and 
provide funding to improve watershed health in those locations. In FY24, 
we began the third year of our current 3-year partnership, which included 
continued participation in WWF’s Noyyal-Bhavani Collective Action Program. 
This program is focused on ensuring that, by 2030, the Noyyal and Bhavani 
sub-basins of the Cauvery River in Southern India are healthy ecosystems that 
ensure water security for people and nature. In addition to addressing regional 
textile industry impacts on freshwater, the program also focuses on improving 
farming water management practices, protecting freshwater biodiversity, 
clearing invasive species, improving groundwater supply and restoring vital 
habitats and wetlands.
Over the past three years, a total of 50 clean-tech facility assessments have 
been completed through the program, enabling the identification of nearly 
500 specific recommendations for water, energy and other operational 
improvements. Facilities that have adopted these recommendations have 
achieved a total water savings of more than 209,000 m3 per year.
The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation has also made several commitments 
to improve access to clean water, as well as sanitation and hygiene around 
the world. More information on these Foundation and Company efforts can be 
found in the Community Engagement & Philanthropy section of this report.

PARTNERSHIP
Safe drinking water is the 
most primary of human needs, 
yet worldwide, one in three 
people do not have access 
to this vital resource. To help 
address this disparity, we 
partner with GiveMeTap, which 
works to provide clean, safe 
drinking water sources to rural 
communities in Africa, while 
also reducing single-use plastic 
waste. To date, our partnership 
has funded 58 water pumps in 
communities, primary schools 
and health centers — including 
15 new pumps in FY24. 
These water pumps directly 
benefit approximately 58,000 
people in the Upper West 
Region of Ghana and alleviate 
the need for miles-long walks 
to the nearest water source, 
allowing children to stay in 
school and women to pursue

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our Approach 
We are committed to conserving natural resources by managing waste 
responsibly. We work to minimize waste in our operations and divert waste 
from landfill and incineration through donation, reuse and recycling. Our  
goal is to continue incorporating zero-waste principles throughout our 
business practices. 
Our Actions
In Our Operations
We are proud to have diverted 94% of waste from landfill and incineration 
across our distribution centers, meeting the Zero Waste International Alliance 
definition of zero waste.1 Many efforts contributed to this milestone, including 
our FY24 initiative to replace fluorescent lights with longer-lasting LED 
lights at two of our North Carolina distribution centers, which will reduce the 
volume of fluorescent lights disposed of by 6,300 pounds annually. We expect 
to maintain at least a 90% diversion level and seek ongoing improvements 
in waste diversion and reduction at all facilities. Our Waste Working Group 
has established partnerships in several regions to support our waste 
diversion efforts. This includes piloting and partnering with new recycling 
vendors globally to identify higher value uses for our excess materials. We 
also prioritize disposition methods that extend the life of our products with 
donations and employee sales as a first option.
We are continually working to identify actions we can take in our corporate 
offices that contribute to waste reduction and diversion. For example, we have 
an ongoing partnership with FABSCRAP to recycle and reuse sample fabric, 
leading to approximately 13,000 pounds of fabric diverted from landfill in 
FY24. We have also implemented composting at our corporate headquarters 
in New York City, which resulted in keeping over 20 tons of organic waste out 
of the landfill in FY24. 
Packaging
In FY24, we continued to make progress toward our sustainable packaging 
goal, including: 
•	 Beginning a shift to 100% recycled plastic fasteners, which will continue 
in the coming years
Waste Management
2025 GOAL
Achieve 100% recyclable, reusable 
or sustainably sourced packaging 
materials by the end of 2025
94%
Diversion rate of waste from  
landfill and incineration across  
our distribution centers
1 Using the Zero Waste International Alliance definition of zero waste, we will divert more than 90% of the waste generated at our distribution centers from landfill and incineration.

We also continued piloting paper-based alternatives to polybags used in North 
American Polo Retail Outlets and e-commerce, and kicked off work to begin 
phasing out polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in our packaging. Of our total packaging 
volume, 79% met at least one of our sustainable packaging criteria in FY24, 
compared to 73% in FY23.
Managing Excess Inventory
Our Excess Inventory Management Principles continue to guide our approach 
for limiting excess inventory and maximizing waste diversion. Through our 
Fabric First Initiative, we are focused on decreasing lead times in production, 
allowing us to keep our orders as close as possible to market demand. In 
FY24, this initiative helped increase flexibility in our supply chain, resulting 
in significant waste reduction. We also continued to prevent excess by 
decreasing the amount of product purchased specifically for sale at Polo 
Retail Outlets and increasing the amount of product originally offered through 
other channels (e.g., wholesale) for sale at Polo Retail Outlets.
In FY24, we tested our new predictive buying model, an AI-driven purchasing 
tool that allows for more accurate forecasting, in our European stores. 
Based on the success of this pilot, we plan to continue scaling its use to an  
expanded range of categories and markets over time, allowing us to forecast 
demand more accurately, so we can reduce overproduction and lessen  
excess inventory. 
We are committed to identifying and applying sustainable options for 
managing excess and damaged products. In the past year, we continued to 
increase diversion of excess inventory with new and expanded recycling and 
donation partnerships globally.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our Approach 
We monitor and reduce hazardous chemical use and discharge, as we are 
committed to using safer and more sustainable chemicals throughout our 
business to address their human and environmental impact. We view chemical 
management as a continuous and collaborative effort to ensure there is 
no intentional use and discharge of hazardous chemicals in our industry’s 
collective supply chain. The chemistries and chemical applications in our 
industry continue to develop and evolve. In FY24, in keeping with the industry-
wide developments, we enhanced our chemical management strategy, 
developed more targeted impact measurement and implemented broader 
integration into our business.
Our Sustainable Chemical Management Policy outlines our approach to 
assessing the impacts of the chemicals in our supply chain and partnering  
with our manufacturers on responsible chemical management practices.
Our Actions
Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals Programme
Ralph Lauren is a signatory in the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals 
(ZDHC) Programme, a sector-wide coalition aimed at advancing the industry 
toward zero discharge of hazardous chemicals. Through this partnership,  
we collaborate with peers and experts to eliminate the use and discharge  
of these chemicals across our apparel supply chain. Since 2020, we have 
adopted the ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) 
and ZDHC-approved Chemical Inventory List Management Tools to enable 
our suppliers to track and report on all chemicals used in the creation of 
our products, and prioritize the substitution of harmful chemicals with safer, 
MRSL-conformant alternatives.
The MRSL and the industry’s collective work in sustainable chemicals 
management continues to evolve. New materials, safer and more sustainable 
alternatives, chemical testing, tools and technologies continue to develop over 
time. We are advancing toward the full elimination of hazardous chemicals in 
our global supply chain, and we are committed to continuing to do so as our 
industry evolves. In FY24, we continued expanding our visibility into chemical 
products used in our manufacturing supply chain, as well as their conformance 
status with the MRSL. We currently have visibility into chemical inventories of 
our Tier 1 manufacturing facilities representing 91% of our business volume, 
compared to 79% in FY23. Of the chemicals reported, 84% conform with the 
Chemical Management

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
CHEMICAL INVENTORY 
VERIFICATION 
The quality of MRSL 
conformance data for 
chemical products used in our 
manufacturing supply chain 
depends on the accuracy and 
completeness of the chemical 
inventory uploaded by our 
suppliers. In FY24, we piloted 
ZDHC’s chemical inventory 
verification methodology, 
including an additional step to 
verify the commodity chemical 
products used in our supply 
chain. Thirty-six finished goods 
facilities with wet processing 
were nominated to the pilot,  
and the result showed that  
100% of them achieved an 
overall pass result, with an 
average of 96% of chemical 
products verified as compliant 
with the ZDHC standard.
MRSL. In our Tier 2 supply chain, we have chemical visibility on 63% of our 
woven, knit and sweater core fabric business volume. Additionally, 94% of 
the chemicals reported conform with the MRSL. We are working closely with 
suppliers to achieve full MRSL conformance by the end of 2025 and beyond. 
In addition to ensuring chemical transparency and MRSL conformance, we 
evaluated the operational aspects of chemical management at the facility 
level using the Chemical Management section in the Higg FEM. In FY24, our 
Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers and subcontracted facilities achieved average scores of 
26, 28 and 28 points, respectively.
To guide and align our efforts to eliminate the use and discharge of hazardous 
chemicals with the industry’s standards and best practices, we implement the 
ZDHC MRSL Wastewater Guidelines which provide clear guidance in effluent 
testing methods, parameters, limits and reporting approach as a way to 
confirm that our manufacturing facility is not discharging hazardous chemicals 
to the environment.
While the wastewater test is only a snapshot of the effluent quality of the 
facility, we require annual testing at a minimum, which allows us to follow 
up and address any nonconformance from its source through a root cause 
analysis approach that aligns with the ZDHC. This helps inform both the 
facility and Ralph Lauren on targeted chemicals phase out at the facility level. 
In FY24, 86% of our Tier 1 facilities and 59% of our Tier 2 core fabric facilities 
by business volume, have performed the wastewater test in accordance 
with the Guidelines. Of all the facilities that performed the test, 72% are in 
compliance with the ZDHC requirements, and out of the substances screened 
99.7% comply with the ZDHC standard.
Eliminating Priority Chemicals
We currently ban the intentional use of the following:
•	 PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in water repellent / resistant 
fabrics. PFAS have been incorporated into our product testing manual to 
ensure product compliance with our RSL standard.
•	 PVC (polyvinyl chloride) in all materials and prints. PVC has been 
incorporated into our product testing manual to ensure that our prints 
are not PVC-based.
•	 PP (potassium permanganate) in our denim washes. We are on track to 
phase out the use of PP spray in non-denim products as well.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our Approach
As ecosystems and species are increasingly threatened, we are committed 
to leveraging science and globally recognized frameworks to understand and 
address our key impacts on nature by:
•	 Identifying ways to avoid new negative impacts and reduce existing  
ones, where possible
•	 Developing strategies to restore and regenerate ecosystems in our  
value chain
•	 Identifying opportunities to engage in transformative, systems-level 
efforts to address causes of nature loss
We have begun work to establish a strategy and goals in alignment with 
Science Based Targets for Nature. Our approach will be integrated and 
built upon our existing initiatives in areas such as climate change and water 
stewardship. Biodiversity impacts all aspects of our value chain, so as we 
continue on our nature strategy development journey, we will seek to engage 
our supply chain partners in our goals and initiatives.
Our Actions
In FY24, we began leveraging the Science Based Targets (SBTs) for Nature 
methodology to shape our biodiversity goals and strategy. Through our 
engagement with Quantis, a leading environmental sustainability consultancy, 
we conducted a formal assessment of our nature-related impacts.
Specifically, we completed Steps 1 and 2, which included conducting a 
fashion and retail sector materiality assessment, determining where we 
have the greatest impact within our value chain given our material use, and 
prioritizing the areas of highest nature impact. Following the SBTs for Nature 
methodology, our assessment took a location-specific and commodity-
specific approach, examining the most pressing nature issues for us — which 
include water quantity, water quality, soil pollution, land use change, land use 
and biodiversity — as well as identifying key raw materials to prioritize, in 
particular cotton and cashmere. 
Looking ahead, we will leverage findings from Steps 1 and 2 to inform the 
development of a comprehensive nature strategy and goals that will cover 
impact areas such as water, land use and ecosystem engagement.

OUR BIODIVERSITY JOURNEY
Using the SBTs for Nature methodology we are shaping our nature goals  
and strategy.
Addressing Deforestation
Deforestation and land conversion are key drivers of biodiversity and habitat 
loss. For a third year, we purchased Impact Partnership Incentives through 
the Textile Exchange Leather Impact Accelerator (LIA). Impact Partnership 
Incentives directly supports Produzindo Certo, an on-the-ground organization 
working with cattle farms in Brazil. It seeks to improve their practices to 
achieve animal welfare certification within three years and have their farms 
third-party verified as deforestation / conversion-free annually. In FY24, our 
support for LIA helped to empower eight cattle farms in Brazil to work towards 
achieving Textile Exchange’s benchmarked standards for animal welfare and 
zero deforestation.
Partnerships and Engagement
Our business, industry and the communities we are a part of depend on 
healthy, well-functioning natural ecosystems. A key aspect of our sustainable 
materials and biodiversity strategy is to pioneer, foster and scale impact 
through industry partnerships and engagements. We continue to actively 
engage with The Fashion Pact’s biodiversity pillar, which is focused on 
supporting members with developing biodiversity strategies aligned with SBTs 
for Nature, identifying pathways for reducing nature impacts of key materials  
and driving collective action at the landscape level.

Shaping a business that is timeless means building 
relationships that stand the test of time and focusing 
on causes and actions that simultaneously benefit our 
communities, our teams and our Company. That’s why 
we’re committed to helping people thrive today and 
building a brighter future for tomorrow.

Our Actions
Employee Experience
Annually, we conduct an engagement and enablement survey to gain feedback 
from employees. In FY24, we established a new global goal related to the 
question we ask employees regarding whether people leaders “champion 
diversity and psychological safety,” and in FY24 we met our goal with 
responses 80% favorable. To understand employee sentiment related to DE&I, 
we also ask employees to react to the statement “Ralph Lauren is committed 
to DE&I in the workplace.” In FY24, responses were 85% favorable.
Talent
At Ralph Lauren, we are dedicated to cultivating a culture where every team 
member feels like they belong. Our mission extends beyond assembling 
diverse teams, it involves embedding the principles of inclusion and belonging 
into the fabric of our organization, ensuring these values are a top priority 
enterprise-wide and ensuring there are opportunities for all talent to elevate 
into our leadership ranks.
Early Career Talent
To enhance diverse representation within our early talent pool and ensure 
our early career talent reflects the communities we serve, we leverage two 
distinct talent pipelines — undergraduate and MBA students. As we deepen 
our partnerships with professional organizations and educational institutions, 
we have incorporated baseline criteria to focus our engagement with partners 
that align with our Company values, beliefs and business objectives. Examples 
of this include:
•	 Partnerships with 12 historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), 
via our Company and the Foundation, including scholarships, mentorship 
and development opportunities. For more information on our HBCU 
scholarships, see the Community Engagement & Philanthropy section 
of this report.
•	 Launching our UK-based internship program with Rio Ferdinand 
Foundation in FY24, allowing four emerging leaders to participate in a 
year-long internship with Ralph Lauren’s teams. This supports our work 
together to create opportunities for young people to tackle inequality, 
achieve their personal potential and drive social change. 
•	 Membership in the New York Jobs CEO Council, a coalition of  
employers focused on providing access to high-potential jobs for  
low-income New Yorkers, and those within Black, Hispanic/Latinx and 
Asian communities, including students from the City University of New 
York (CUNY) system. Through this coalition, we have deepened our 
relationship with CUNY schools and provided their students access to 
our early career opportunities.

elevate leadership through a strategic focus on three foundational pillars: 
skills and capabilities, mindset and networking. Tailored for professionals at 
every career stage, these three distinct learning programs cater to diverse 
backgrounds and experiences. 
Pay Equity
We take a proactive approach to workplace equity and continually monitor 
our compensation and employee development programs to ensure fairness. 
In FY24, we expanded our partnership with an independent firm to analyze 
our employee compensation based on gender, race and ethnicity to ensure 
pay equity and to also include analyses of movement within the Company to 
assess employee opportunity.
We conduct pay equity analyses of employees performing work with similar 
skills, effort and responsibility to identify and correct, if identified, any 
statistically significant relationships between gender and pay and/or between 
race and ethnicity and pay. Our review of our employees’ compensation 
includes 100% of our global population.
We also conduct precision analyses of representation and promotions to 
identify any negative patterns and determine if corrective actions are needed 
to ensure fairness of movement within the Company.
Opportunities for advancement are posted both internally and externally. In 
addition to the steps we take to analyze pay equity and employee opportunity, 
and to continue to deliver on our commitment of achieving 100% pay equity, 
we will ensure we use data-informed insights and actions to:
•	 Ensure all hires and pay changes (merit, market adjustments,  
promotions, transfers) are equitable year-round
•	 Increase transparency around pay and opportunities

Elevating Our Communities
Ralph Lauren makes a conscious effort to celebrate the many communities 
that make up our diverse global workforce and the consumers we serve. 
Internally, many of these efforts occur during designated heritage and 
awareness moments, supported by our EIGs. Our robust programming 
includes speaker series, employee panels, educational forums and “Powerful 
Perspectives,” which are management-led conversations focused on different 
DE&I topics across the globe. 
Externally, we support and partner with organizations and initiatives that 
elevate communities and promote equality and social justice. In FY24, this 
included partnering with Fashion For All Foundation as a brand partner for 
their Bridge To Basel competition. We made a $50,000 donation for their work 
to assist, educate and support minority students who are pursuing careers in 
the creative, art and fashion industry with the tools and information about Art 
Basel and the inner-workings of the art industry. 
#RLPRIDE
Ralph Lauren and the Foundation have been proud supporters of LGBTQIA+ 
communities for more than 30 years. Building on our year-round employee 
programming about topics important to LGBTQIA+ communities, our 2023

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Disability 360
At Ralph Lauren, we are committed to respecting and supporting people with 
disabilities.​ In FY24, we launched Disability 360, an enterprise-wide equity 
strategy that supports people with disabilities across six focus areas:
•	 Accessibility
•	 Education
•	 Product
•	 Partnerships
•	 Marketing
•	 Talent 
We are launching this strategy in phases, with the first phase focused on 
offering education opportunities to employees, developing relationships with 
organizations that can help guide us on our journey and learning how we  
can best support communities with disabilities. In FY24, as part of this first 
phase, we:
•	 Created an Inclusive Design Toolkit to embed inclusivity, accessibility 
and functionality in our products and consumer shopping experiences. 
This includes opportunities for simple product additions and integrations, 
and sample adaptive fashion styles that could be designed. 
•	 Launched a global Disability Learning Capsule, which provides 
employees with self-directed learning and is a support resource for our 
Disability Equity EIG.
•	 Partnered with internal global teams to conduct audits of our North 
America stores to ensure accessibility for employees and customers.
•	 Improved the accessibility of our e-commerce website with the Web 
Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 AA Standards in North America and 
Canada, including an audit of our mobile app.
Education
We are continuing to refine and deploy a structured DE&I curriculum internally 
with an emphasis on accountability for people leaders, while also advocating 
for equitable access to education for all.
Learning Programs
Our Company is made up of a truly global population, and we value the varied 
perspectives our employees bring. We aim to build a culture centered around 
trust, inclusivity and belonging, supported by training and education. As part 
of this, every Ralph Lauren employee has an annual learning goal that includes 
participating in at least five hours of DE&I learning. In FY24, we introduced 
three new DE&I learning programs, including our Pride Learning Capsule, our 
Disability Learning Capsule and Cultural Awareness Fundamentals. 
31,500+ 
Employee DE&I Learning Hours  
in FY24
OPEN-SOURCE LEARNING
Through a partnership with 
The State University of New 
York (SUNY), we continue to 
share our comprehensive DE&I 
curricula including:
•	
“Includership”  
Foundations eLearning
•	
Difficult vs. Uncomfortable 
Conversations  
Learning Capsule
•	
Disability Learning Capsule
•	
Pride Learning Capsule
Our learnings are designed to 
foster understanding, promote 
inclusivity and address biases 
within our organization. As we 
open sourced this curriculum, 
our educational content will  
be customized to resonate 
with the 1.3 million students 
attending SUNY’s 64 colleges 
and universities. This exercise 
will allow Ralph Lauren to  
benefit from SUNY’s insights  
on the adaptation and 
deployment of this content 
while students will benefit by 
gaining the knowledge and skills 
to foster a more inclusive and 
respectful environment.

Our Approach
The contributions of our employees make Ralph Lauren a vibrant organization. 
Our people drive our success, and we are dedicated to supporting the 
physical, emotional, social and financial needs of our employees and their 
families to help them thrive. 
Our Actions
Employee Programs
We provide resources to support each employee’s health, well-being and 
quality of life. Our global wellness program provides access to benefits such 
as flexible work arrangements, sabbaticals and other support mechanisms. 
This program includes our app-based support tool, Thrive Global, a leading 
behavior change technology company providing personalized and on-demand 
health and wellness resources. In FY24, we encouraged the use of the app 
through targeted internal communications, which included integrating it 
within our Microsoft Teams platform and hosting nine live webinar events that 
attracted over 800 attendees. The integration resulted in a 68% increase in 
users, over 100,000 individual daily check-in responses from 4,600 unique 
responders, and a 73% employee engagement rate.

MENTAL HEALTH  
FIRST AID 
Mental Health First Aid is 
an early intervention public 
education program from the 
National Council for Mental 
Wellbeing. In FY24, Ralph Lauren 
rolled out a pilot of this program 
to a dedicated group  
of employees, with future  
plans to expand across the 
broader organization.
The program teaches 
participants how to recognize 
the signs and symptoms of 
a potential mental health 
challenge, how to ​listen and 
provide reassurance,​ and how to 
refer an individual to appropriate 
professional support and 
services when needed.​
Employee Benefits
The Ralph Lauren benefits program aims to support employee well-being, 
individual life choices and priorities. From medical benefits to our employee 
assistance program, family planning, retirement plans and more, we offer 
comprehensive options that are flexible to our employees’ individual needs 
and preferences. 
Employee Learning and Development
In FY24, our commitment to nurturing employee growth and development 
remained steadfast. We provided a comprehensive suite of development 
programs catering to all career levels. Alongside continuous on-the-job 
training, development and coaching, our employees benefited from enhancing 
skills via our Ralph Lauren Learning platform. 
The RL Learning Academy, our professional development program for all 
employees, continued to bolster our management and leadership development 
initiatives. Additionally, we increased our focus on practical knowledge 
building and employee empowerment from resources like product knowledge 
materials and immersive learning capsules addressing LGBTQIA+ and  
Disability inclusion in the workplace. We further improved our onboarding  
process for employees by introducing comprehensive guides tailored to  
both people managers and individual contributors, along with immersive  
brand experiences.
These initiatives not only serve to empower our employees but also 
underscore our commitment to cultivating an inclusive workplace culture. 
By equipping our team with the necessary tools and insights for professional 
growth, we facilitate career progression and strengthen our employees’ 
alignment with our Company values, vision and Purpose.

2024 BENEFITS ENHANCEMENTS
Family-Focused Benefits: We understand that everyone has unique needs 
when it comes to caring for and growing their families. In FY24, we:
•	
Extended our paid parental leave policy to six weeks to better support 
employees welcoming the birth, adoption or fostering of a new child.
•	
Launched a new digital platform in the U.S., through Maven, which 
provides 24/7 virtual care and resources for family building, pregnancy, 
postpartum, parenting and menopause.
•	
Expanded coverage in the U.S. of the lifetime maximum for fertility 
benefits, including storage and donor costs.
LGBTQIA+ Benefits: We also recognize the unique needs of LGBTQIA+ 
individuals and are committed to providing tailored benefits and resources 
that affirm the experiences of our LGBTQIA+ employees. To that end, we 
launched our LGBTQIA+ Inclusive Care Guide in the U.S., a tool that raises 
awareness to benefit information tailored to these communities like gender-
affirming care, adoption and surrogacy resources, mental health support 
and more.
Employee Engagement and Enablement Scores
We aim to create a work environment that supports all our employees and 
enables them to thrive. To that end, we conduct an employee engagement and 
enablement survey annually to gain feedback for continuous improvement.
Engagement is based on four questions related to pride in the Company, a 
sense of personal accomplishment and intent to stay. Enablement is based 
on six questions related to sense of belonging, environment efficacy, tools 
and resources, skills and abilities and achieving career goals. Ralph Lauren 
achieved 81% Engagement and 73% Enablement scores in FY24.

Our Approach
We seek to make the dream of a better life a reality in communities across 
the globe through contributions and actions that create positive social and 
environmental impact. The two main drivers of our giving efforts are the Social 
Partnerships and Philanthropy department within the Company and The Ralph 
Lauren Corporate Foundation (the Foundation), a distinct charitable entity 
established in 2001. 
The Company and the Foundation both invest in communities through 
donations, collaborating with nonprofits and empowering employees to 
support causes they are passionate about through volunteering and the Ralph 
Lauren Employee Matching Gift Program. The Company and the Foundation 
also strive to educate our teams on key issues and highlight causes important 
to our mission to champion better lives, often working together to scale impact 
in the communities we serve. 
Social Partnerships and Philanthropy 
Our Company takes a shared-value approach — focusing on causes 
and actions that create simultaneous positive impacts that benefit our 
communities, our teams and our Company. The SPP department seeks 
to make the dream of a better life a reality through strategically aligned 
relationships, partnerships, initiatives and volunteering that make a positive, 
sustainable community impact through four key areas.

PARTNERSHIP
For over a decade, the Company 
has supported The Royal 
Marsden Cancer Charity in 
London, opening The Ralph 
Lauren Centre for Breast 
Cancer Research in 2016. 
In FY24, we celebrated the 
opening of the Ralph Lauren 
Research Wing in the Oak 
Cancer Centre, which brings 
together over 150 researchers 
working across cancer types 
to speed up progress for the 
benefit of patients globally. 
Additionally, Ralph Lauren 
employees in the U.K. are deeply 
connected to the organization, 
annually raising funds for  
Royal Marsden through Pink 
Pony activities.
Pink Pony
Pink Pony is the Company’s worldwide initiative supporting the fight against 
cancer, focused on programs for research, screenings, early diagnosis, 
treatment, education and patient navigation through the Foundation grants 
in the U.S. and Company donations around the world. In FY24, the Pink Pony 
employee fundraising campaign raised over $250,000. We held 80 events 
globally, including 25 of our Pink Pony walks, which provide an opportunity for 
Ralph Lauren team members to come together to honor and celebrate those 
impacted by cancer. Each year, we walk through parks, shopping centers, 
distribution centers and other spaces in our local communities. For more 
about Pink Pony, visit The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation section of  
this report.
Citizenship & Sustainability 
We work with our Sustainability teams to recycle, repurpose and donate to 
extend the life cycle of excess product. Through organizations like Delivering 
Good and World Vision, we support community-based partners who provide 
high-quality garments to children, individuals and families in times of need, 
providing over $24 million in product donations1 in FY24 alone.

& OVERVIEW
Education and DE&I 
Many of the Company’s philanthropic programs support education for 
students, such as the United Negro College Fund’s scholarships that provide 
need-based and last dollar awards to students from system-impacted 
communities to complete their degree. We also provide scholarship support 
for students annually through our partnership with the Institute of American 
Indian Arts. 
We support initiatives that galvanize our Employee Impact Groups (EIGs).  
For example, in FY24, sales from the Pin of Solidarity, created by Ralph 
Lauren’s Black and African American EIG, supported the Rio Ferdinand 
Foundation. More details can be found in the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
section of this report.
Ralph Lauren Gives Back and Community Resilience 
The Company supports Ralph Lauren Gives Back, which is a joint program 
with the Foundation and empowers employees to volunteer in the communities 
in which they live and where Ralph Lauren does business. 
Ralph Lauren Gives Back Volunteering Program
As part of this program, we celebrated four volunteer months throughout 
FY24, each tying to our impact areas. This included Earth Month in April, 
education and access in August, Pink Pony Month in October and Season of 
Giving from November 28 through December 31. With a shift back to in-person 
volunteering and events happening throughout the year, our employees 
contributed over 10,000 volunteer hours to charitable organizations globally 
in FY24. 
Ralph Lauren Employee Matching Gift Program
Through the Ralph Lauren Employee Matching Gift program, employee 
donations are matched on a one-to-one basis by the Foundation, up to a 
total of $1 million per fiscal year. To date, teams from all around the world 
have taken part in this program, which now includes grants to more than 600 
nonprofits across 18 countries.
Global Relief Efforts 
The Company and the Foundation are proud to provide crisis support through 
organizations like CARE and American Red Cross, and amplify RL employees’ 
personal contributions by matching and double-matching philanthropic 
donations in support of those affected. In FY24, the Company and the 
Foundation collectively provided financial and product donations to support 
global relief and emergency response efforts. 
THE RALPH LAUREN 
DESIGN SCHOLARS 
PROGRAM
In FY24, Ralph Lauren 
established a new Fashion 
Design scholarship program at 
Marist College that will award a 
student $100,000 in scholarship 
funds over four years as we work 
together to increase educational 
opportunities for students 
in the fashion industry. The 
scholarship program  
will help remove financial 
barriers to a fashion education 
while providing important 
resources and support for 
aspiring designers.
The Ralph Lauren Design 
Scholars Program is focused 
on providing opportunities and 
access for students attending 
design school at Marist, creating 
pathways to creative careers. 
Starting with the 2024-25 
academic year, the scholarship 
will include mentorship and 
development opportunities as 
part of the summer internship 
program held at Ralph Lauren’s 
corporate offices.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Cancer Care and Prevention 
Inspired by a friend’s battle with cancer more than 30 years ago, Ralph Lauren 
made a personal commitment to do all that he could to contribute to the fight 
against cancer. Mr. Lauren’s dedication inspired the Foundation to create 
the Pink Pony Fund, which aims to reduce disparities in cancer care and 
prevention to help underserved communities across the United States access 
quality treatment at an earlier, more curable stage.
Since its founding in 2001, the Pink Pony Fund has helped hundreds of 
thousands of patients in the U.S., primarily through establishing and funding 
patient navigation programs across the country.
SUPPORTING THE JOHNS 
HOPKINS CENTER FOR 
INDIGENOUS HEALTH
With support from the 
Foundation, in spring 2020, the 
Johns Hopkins Center for 
Indigenous Health (JHCIH) 
launched a new initiative to 
address inequities in breast 
cancer morbidity and mortality 
among Native women in 
Chinle, AZ (Navajo Nation) 
and Whiteriver, AZ (White 
Mountain Apache). JHCIH and 
its community-based partners 
conducted a locally designed 
campaign to understand the 
barriers and facilitators to 
cancer care. Supported by 
the Foundation throughout the 
multi-year effort, the campaign 
highlighted an urgent need for 
community-based, culturally 
tailored interventions to improve 
breast cancer prevention 
and early diagnosis in these 
communities.
In 2023, the Foundation awarded 
an additional three-year grant 
to JHCIH. They leveraged this 
funding to develop a tablet-
based intervention to improve 
mammography screening rates. 
The educational tool contains 
strengths-based messaging 
from local thought leaders and 
community members to ensure 
information and resources are 
shared to women in a culturally 
appropriate manner. The team 
is preparing to pilot test the 
intervention this fall.

CASE STUDY
 Ralph Lauren Cancer Centers
In 2022, the Foundation announced a $25 million commitment in new grant funding to expand or establish five 
Ralph Lauren-named cancer centers aimed at reducing disparities in cancer care and access across underserved 
communities in the United States. This philanthropic pledge, the largest in the Foundation’s history, will benefit 
institutions with a National Cancer Institute designation. To date, the Foundation has funded three Ralph Lauren 
Centers and is collaborating with Conquer Cancer Foundation of the American Society of Clinical Oncology to 
select two additional grant recipients.
MEMORIAL SLOAN KETTERING RALPH LAUREN CENTER (MSK RLC)
HARLEM, NEW YORK
For 20 years, Memorial Sloan Kettering Ralph Lauren Center (MSK RLC) has offered cancer prevention, diagnosis, 
treatment and support services in a warm, welcoming and culturally sensitive environment. MSK RLC has cared for 
thousands of people, making it a beacon for accessible, compassionate cancer care for residents of Harlem and 
beyond. In FY24, the Foundation supported MSK RLC’s two primary programmatic and technological expansions: 
installing an ultrasound machine on site in Harlem and expanding the MSK Mobile Health Unit’s footprint in the MSK 
RLC catchment area. Since opening in 2003, MSK RLC has received over 220,000 patient visits.
The recently installed ultrasound machine allows MSK RLC to offer full breast cancer screenings, in addition to the 
services of the Center’s 3D mammography machine. This new technology will streamline care by eliminating the 
need for patients to travel to another facility, and will help to capture breast cancer in its early stages, when it is most 
treatable. In 2024 alone, MSK RLC projects they will perform nearly 500 ultrasounds. 
The Memorial Sloan Kettering Mobile Health Unit is a community outreach and education program that travels 
across New York City providing general health and wellness information and critical information on accessing cancer 
screening tests, amongst other services. The Foundation’s support has expanded the Mobile Health Unit’s presence 
throughout New York City, increasing hours of operation and opportunities for New Yorkers to access preventative 
cancer screenings and treatments.

CASE STUDY (CONTINUED)
RALPH LAUREN CENTER FOR CANCER PREVENTION AT GEORGETOWN LOMBARDI 
COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER  |  WASHINGTON, D.C.
In April 2024, the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Prevention at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer 
Center celebrated one year of offering expanded services in Washington D.C. Since its inception, the center has 
touched thousands of lives by delivering comprehensive cancer education, legal services, patient navigation and 
clinical trial enrollment. 
Through its patient navigation and educational programming, the Center addresses four of the most prevalent types 
of cancer affecting communities in the District of Columbia: breast, colorectal, lung and prostate cancers. The Center 
also engages with the community through educational workshops, speakers and programs that are tailored to meet 
community needs. When necessary, the Center navigates patients across the continuum of care from diagnosis to

Ralph Lauren’s North America leadership team visited the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Prevention at Georgetown

Protecting the Environment 
Our environmental sustainability efforts are supported by the Foundation 
through grants, partnerships and programs aimed at protecting our planet 
and providing access to critical natural resources. The Foundation supports 
environmental organizations focused on local community needs including 
sustainable cotton development, safe water access, adequate sanitation and 
proper hygiene solutions. 
WaterAid
Since 2021, the Foundation has supported WaterAid, a nonprofit organization 
with a focus on improving access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). 
During this project, WaterAid significantly exceeded its goals by directly 
assisting over 6,500 individuals, surpassing the original target of 5,000. 
Additionally, WaterAid reached over 15,000 people indirectly through 
initiatives like the Water Quality Campaign, community awareness 
programs, and events such as World Water Day, Global Handwashing 
Day and World Toilet Day. In total, this project positively impacted nearly 
22,000 individuals across 21 villages and six wards through various efforts, 
including enhancements to WASH infrastructure at both household and 
institutional levels, capacity-building programs and effective behavior change 
communication sessions.
DigDeep 
DigDeep is a human rights nonprofit working to ensure that every person living 
in the U.S. has clean, running water and proper sanitation. DigDeep’s Navajo 
Water Project is a community-managed utility alternative that brings hot and 
cold running water to homes without access to water or sewer lines on the 
Navajo Nation. In 2020, the Foundation made a three-year commitment to 
support the implementation of DigDeep’s Navajo Water Project, which serves 
hundreds of Navajo families each year. 
In FY24, the Foundation committed to an additional three years of funding  
for the Project. With this support, DigDeep’s team successfully brought clean, 
running water and safe sanitation to over 350 households in 2023. This 
happened through a suite of water and wastewater interventions including, 
Home Water System installations, mainline water connections, septic tank 
installations and cleanings, and bathroom upgrades. Additionally, DigDeep 
expanded the Navajo Water Project service area from 19 Chapters to 
31 Chapters across the Navajo Nation.

CASE STUDY
U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund 
Through a grant from the Foundation, in 2021, the Soil Health Institute (SHI) created the U.S. Regenerative Cotton 
Fund (USRCF), a farmer-facing, science-based initiative that supports long-term, sustainable cotton production in 
the U.S., with the goal of eliminating one million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent from the atmosphere by 
2026. The USRCF works to empower growers and their trusted advisors with the education, tools, information and 
networks they need to successfully adopt regenerative soil health systems. The USRCF is focused on  
five key initiatives:
1. Standardizing 
soil measurement 
and goal setting  
through the 
development of 
soil health targets
2. Establishing 
the business case

CASE STUDY (CONTINUED)
Last year, the USRCF made significant strides in increasing understanding and uptake of regenerative practices in 
U.S. cotton, while navigating key challenges and barriers to farm-level change. The Fund focused on:
Establishing Soil Health Benchmarks: Improving soil health is a key benefit to implementing regenerative 
practices, but measuring soil health can be complex and expensive for farmers. Through the USRCF, SHI has 
developed a simplified suite of key soil health metrics and resources, endorsed by the United States Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), to help farmers more easily understand how their soil health compares to that of their peers and 
what they can do to make improvements. 
Incentivizing Farmer Participation: Shifting to regenerative agriculture practices is a significant undertaking for 
farmers which includes changing operations, investing in new supplies and taking risks with testing and learning. 
By expanding a grower’s knowledge and understanding of their soils, farmers can make more informed decisions 
and beneficial management changes. In addition to educating farmers, USRCF continues to leverage analysis to 
demonstrate the economic benefit of transitioning to regenerative practices.
In 2023, after assessing 19 farms representing 108,000 acres in Texas, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina 
and South Carolina, researchers found farms implementing soil health management systems increased net 
farm income by an average of $150 per acre in their cotton rotations.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our Approach
We are committed to conducting our global operations ethically and with 
respect for the dignity of all people who make our products. To support this, 
we work with suppliers to build capabilities, empower workers and collaborate 
with industry partners for positive impact. Our comprehensive approach 
integrates risk assessments, monitoring, remediation, capability-building, 
stakeholder engagement, life skills programs and empowerment opportunities 
for factory workers.
Our Commitment to Respect Human Rights
Our Purpose — to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and 
timeless style — is grounded in a commitment to respect the human rights 
of all those connected to our global operations. This commitment is outlined 
in our Human Rights Policy, which we updated in FY24 to strengthen our 
commitment, adding an explicit provision recognizing the important role 
of human rights defenders and the expectation that they are free from any 
threats, intimidation or similar adverse conduct. We implement this policy 
in our supply chain through human rights due diligence (HRDD) efforts that 
seek to identify, prevent, mitigate and remediate adverse impacts. We do 
so in alignment with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply 
Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector and the United Nations Guiding 
Principles. We continuously assess and evolve our approach to HRDD to align 
with best practices and regulatory and legislative developments. 
In FY24, we worked with Due Diligence Design, a responsible business 
conduct consultancy, on an alignment assessment against OECD due 
diligence guidance. We will use these findings to guide improvements to our 
policies and processes for respecting human rights across our value chain. For 
additional details, view our Human Rights Disclosure.
Championing Factory Workers
Our approach to championing factory workers has three key focus areas: 
women’s empowerment, life skills and wage management. Although these 
focus areas are each individually significant, they work together to represent 
a holistic approach to supporting and advancing factory workers, a majority of 
whom are women.

Our Actions
Women’s Empowerment
In line with our broader Company efforts to support gender equality, we are 
committed to empowering women across our supply chain to have agency 
over their own lives and access to opportunities. To further this effort, we 
focus on three workstreams. First, we foster inclusive workplaces through 
training and education. Second, we amplify women’s voices through gender-
based surveys and effective grievance mechanisms. These two workstreams 
aim to help address some challenges that exist for women to advance and 
support our third workstream: creating leadership opportunities for women 
through career development and management support. 
Reimagining Industry to Support Equality (RISE)
Since 2019, Ralph Lauren has partnered with Business for Social 
Responsibility (BSR) to sponsor HERproject™, a collaborative initiative to 
empower women working in global supply chains through workplace-based 
interventions. In FY24, we completed several outstanding HERprojects, 
including HERfinance in Cambodia, HERhealth in Vietnam and HERessentials 
in India. 
HERPROJECT™ HIGHLIGHTS
HERfinance 
in Cambodia
Following the interventions, on average, across two 
factories, the percentage of female workers who have a 
bank account registered under their name increased by 
six percentage points
HERhealth 
in Vietnam
Following the interventions, on average, across six 
factories, the percentage of female workers who know 
how to self-conduct a breast exam increased by almost 
28 percentage points
HERessentials 
in India
Following the interventions, on average, across five 
factories, the percentage of female workers that 
know what a digital tablet is increased by almost 63 
percentage points

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
In 2023, HERproject™ became part of a new initiative called Reimagining 
Industry to Support Equality (RISE). RISE brought together the four largest 
women’s empowerment programs in the apparel industry — HERproject™, 
P.A.C.E, Cooperative for American Remittances to Everywhere (CARE) and 
Better Work — to scale impact and accelerate equality for female workers in 
the global garment, footwear and home furnishings supply chains. 
Better Work Indonesia Respectful Workplace Program
We recognize that discrimination, harassment and gender-based violence 
are salient human rights risks in the garment sector. To mitigate these risks, 
enable safe workplaces and support workers, in FY24, we participated in 
Better Work Indonesia’s Respectful Workplace Program (RWP). The RWP 
is an initiative dedicated to creating safe, harassment-free workplaces by 
enhancing self-awareness of inappropriate behaviors, developing the capacity 
of factories to prevent and resolve such issues, and adopting a comprehensive 
approach that involves everyone from top management to line workers and 
trade unions. 
The RWP’s multifaceted training and outreach efforts are aimed at ensuring 
all employees understand, can identify and address inappropriate conduct, 
to foster ethical workplaces. The RWP uses a train-the-trainer model to 
cascade learnings across factory workers. We invited four factories making 
Ralph Lauren products to join this program. Better Work Indonesia is expected 
to conduct an impact survey across these factories later this year. A prior 
impact survey across other factories in the RWP found that participants 
thought attending the training helped to promote a respectful workplace and 
prevent sexual harassment. We hope to achieve similar results. 
It’s critical for apparel companies like Ralph Lauren to 
understand and support the unique needs of the garment workers 
in their supply chains, which vary globally. In 2023 alone, Ralph 
Lauren helped RISE support almost 2,500 workers and make 
the case for further investments to support women workers in 
Guatemala. We look forward to continuing to scale our impact 
together in the years ahead.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Apparel Training & Design Centre
Last year, we launched a partnership with the Apparel Training & Design 
Centre (ATDC), one of the largest vocational training networks in the garment 
sector in India. This partnership established a pilot program to equip female 
factory workers with the interpersonal and technical skills needed for career 
progression in their sector. Selected participants attended training, which 
included soft skills focused on the importance of women in leadership, 
communication, time management, stress management, gender equality and 
the significance of health. Technical skills were also included in the training. 
Training results were then evaluated and each participant was provided with 
career progression options and guidance on how to achieve these goals.
The pilot program rolled out in FY24 to six factories with approximately  
800 participants, ultimately impacting over 6,800 workers. We are currently 
assessing the program and making any necessary adjustments, with a plan 
to scale it beyond Ralph Lauren factories to maximize impact for the wider 
apparel industry in India.
RISE DIGITAL IN GUATEMALA
Ralph Lauren cosponsored the pilot of RISE Digital (formerly HERessentials) 
in Guatemala, which concluded in FY24. The pilot had three objectives: 
1.	 Complete a needs assessment 
2.	 Adapt the RISE module and educational programming 
3.	 Implement the RISE Digital program to learn and assess opportunities  
for expansion 
RISE Digital is a six-month app-based learning program engaging workers 
on digital literacy, health, financial resilience and tools for building 
harmonious relationships and managing stress. The program also includes 
modules for managers on problem solving and workplace relations. 
This pilot was a collaboration across three brands and included three 
participating factories, including one nominated by Ralph Lauren. Using a 
peer education model, RISE and its local partner, CARE, directly supported 
100 workers from our nominated factory to become peer educators. 
The nominated peer educators then helped train additional workers. 
Between direct and indirect reach, over 500 workers were impacted at the 
nominated factory, 56% of whom were women.

Life Skills and Worker Engagement 
To help achieve our goal of making empowerment and life skills programming 
available to 250,000 workers across our supply chain, we partner with a  
range of local organizations and specialists to implement programs that 
support workers.
Support for Digital Wages and Financial Literacy in Cambodia
Digital wage payments can increase transparency and reduce the potential 
for labor violations, among other risks and inefficiencies. To expand these 
benefits, in FY24 we continued our support for the transition to digital wages 
in Cambodia and the corresponding need for financial literacy. We nominated 
another two factories to participate in a joint project through the Textile, 
Apparel, Footwear & Travel Goods Association in Cambodia, Better Factories 
Cambodia (BFC) and the ILO Global Centre on Digital Wages for Decent Work 
(ILO Global Centre) on transitioning to digital wages. Factories in the program 
received training on responsible wage digitization, access to advisory support, 
tools for promoting financial literacy and assistance negotiating with financial 
service providers.
At the end of FY23, we had two factories participate in a financial education 
training-of-trainers program sponsored by BFC and the ILO Global Centre. 
The program intends to build local ILO-certified trainers to support financial 
education opportunities for workers. Certified trainers can then replicate 
learnings to their respective factories and others. The BFC and the ILO Global 
Centre also offered a program on financial literacy for garment workers and 
their communities in which we had one factory participate in FY24. This six-
month program is intended to increase workers’ knowledge of local digital 
financial products and offerings and support financial education.
South India Textile and Garment Supply Chain Project 
By participating in the South India Textile and Garment Supply Chain Project 
initiative implemented by the local NGO Social Awareness and Voluntary 
Education (SAVE), we continued our efforts to educate and empower 
workers and their communities in the spinning and textile mills in Tamil Nadu. 
The SAVE program has a three-pronged approach to addressing the root 
causes and key actors in mitigating forced labor risks by focusing on the 
labor agents who recruit workers, the communities where workers originate 
and the spinning mills who employ them. For example, this past fiscal year, 
SAVE hosted a workshop on fair recruitment processes for human resource 
managers for factories in Tamil Nadu. 
Through the SAVE program, nine resource centers were established in the 
community, providing education on financial and digital literacy, labor rights, 
reproductive health and nutrition and pre-departure training. As of FY24, over 
1,500 workers directly benefited from the trainings offered by SAVE. To date, 
more broadly, over 24,000 current and prospective workers and their families 
have benefited from this project, with 70% being female.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Additionally, the program provides training and access to the This is My 
Backyard app, a platform for workers to raise grievances about any aspect of 
the employment process. All grievances are addressed in a multi-stakeholder 
approach through the suppliers with support of industry associations, SAVE 
and brand partners. 
Worker Voice Surveys
Worker voice tools, such as surveys, allow factory workers to share their needs 
and experiences at work. These insights can be used to inform better policies, 
programs and business decisions at the factory and brand level. 
In FY24, working with third-party providers Ulula and Labor Solutions, we 
launched a worker survey at seven factories across India, China and the 
Philippines to gather baseline data that will help identify opportunities 
for improving worker engagement and life skills training. In response to 
survey results, action plans were then created and are being implemented 
at each factory to address underperforming areas, such as worker stress, 
factory communication and financial needs. We are currently monitoring the 
implementation of action plans, including e-learnings focused on life skills 
training in some of the factories. Follow-up surveys are conducted about one 
year after the original survey to assess progress. 
136,000+
workers reached through our life 
skills and empowerment programs
PROJECT SALAHE – IMPROVING ACCESS TO  
GRIEVANCE MECHANISMS
In a multi-stakeholder partnership led by InHub, Ralph Lauren participated 
in Project Salahe, which focuses on improving awareness and accessibility 
to grievance mechanisms.
In FY24, Ralph Lauren supported a technology-based intervention to 
enhance the grievance mechanism of a factory in India. Kiosks and display 
screens were set up and training was offered to workers to raise awareness 
about existing grievance channels with the collateral impact of improving 
digital literacy. This technology helps improve reporting and tracking of 
factory-level grievances and helps develop a better workplace culture 
through increasing management’s visibility into existing issues. We look 
forward to following the results of this program and examining its potential 
to scale.

Wage Management
Ralph Lauren is committed to supporting workers in receiving fair 
compensation throughout our supply chain. With this, our Wage Management 
Strategy consists of five key modules of work to achieve a positive impact. 
We have active workstreams within each module that provide tools and 
resources for suppliers to improve their wage systems, in addition to our 
internal work on responsible purchasing practices which better enable 
suppliers to meet their wage goals. 
We use our baseline wage level and wage management system data 
collection to inform areas of opportunity. Through that process, we identified 
opportunities to improve human resource and wage management systems, 
so in FY24, we focused on the following activities: strengthening wage 
management systems at the supplier and factory level and wage data 
collection and analysis.
Strengthening Wage Management Systems
To support suppliers in strengthening their wage management systems, 
we have further developed our Wage Management Assessment tool and 
incorporated it into a Human Resource Management (HRM) Playbook.
A reference guide and toolkit, the HRM Playbook provides suppliers with 
materials to help them understand HRM best practices and to assess, analyze 
and act to improve their own practices. We have developed a draft of the HRM

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Wage Data Collection and Analysis
We utilize the Fair Labor Association’s (FLA) Fair Compensation toolkit, 
which aligns with our aim to adopt industry tools, easing the burden on 
our suppliers and increasing the amount of comparative wage data for the 
industry. The toolkit consists of the FLA’s Wage Data Collection Tool and Fair 
Compensation Dashboard, which are scalable tools that allow companies to 
gather worker wage data from their suppliers, conduct analyses and measure 
progress over time. The Dashboard provides living wage benchmarks from 
over 30 countries and helps suppliers measure their wages against other local 
factories. In FY24, we received over 130 Wage Data tools during our biennial 
wage data collection across 15 countries. We look forward to analyzing the 
data in FY25 and using it to inform our wage management programming.
Assessments, Monitoring and Remediation
Our Global Citizenship team conducts human rights due diligence by 
scoping potential risks, preventing and mitigating those identified and 
remediating issues when found. Part of these efforts includes monitoring 
supplier compliance. This starts with our Operating Standards (OS), which 
communicate our expectations of suppliers. All new suppliers are assessed 
against these before we place an order with them.
We work with suppliers to identify the root cause of issues and agree on 
corrective action plans that prioritize workers’ welfare and livelihoods. We 
remain committed to ensuring that workers have access to effective grievance 
mechanisms and that they can voice their concerns without fear of retaliation.
Alongside industry-wide assessment tools like Better Work and the Social 
& Labor Convergence Program (SLCP), we use independent third-party 
assessments to complement our continuous due diligence and site-based 
risk monitoring processes. Assessment results feed into our overall supplier 
scoring through our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES), which directly 
influences our sourcing decisions and strategy for managing, preventing and 
mitigating risks in our supply chain.
LIVING WAGE PILOT1 
In FY24, the Fair Labor Association (FLA) conducted a living wage pilot 
with a supplier we work with in Vietnam. The pilot assessed purchasing 
practices, factory compensation systems and worker engagement 
opportunities to improve wages and workers’ understanding of wage 
structure. The pilot resulted in analysis of the living wage gap, identification 
of best practices for factory compensation systems and training for 
managers and top management on living wages. Buyers were provided 
recommendations related to purchasing practices, sourcing strategies and 
impact analysis on wage improvements. We are incorporating the learnings 
from this pilot into our wage management strategy.
1 The pilot was funded by the Initiative for Global Solidarity (IGS) implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and supported by the German Federal Ministry for	
  Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The Research Center for Employment Relationship in Vietnam was the local implementation partner with FLA.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our active factories receive performance rating which ranges from green, 
indicating good to exceptional level of performance, to red, indicating  
a violation of our Operating Standards with one or more critical issues and 
a risk of business termination. These ratings are a component of analyzing 
supplier risk.
Supplier Assessments
We recognize the industry-wide need to streamline the monitoring process, 
reduce audit fatigue and reallocate resources to allow for more capability-
building and worker well-being initiatives. To that end, in FY24, we continued 
our adoption of SLCP to complement our social compliance assessment tools. 
In FY24, we increased adoption of industry common assessment tools  
(both SLCP and Better Work) by factories representing 63% of our business 
volume in Tier 1. In general, we take a risk-based approach to our assessments 
to ensure we are prioritizing areas for action. We assessed 79% of factories 
supplying Ralph Lauren in FY24, representing 88% of our business volume.  
We also partnered with SLCP to further promote the tool to upstream 
suppliers through various education sessions and we increased the adoption 
of both SLCP and Better Work to fabric and yarn mill suppliers that made up 
about 61% of our core fabric business. These tools help us better identify the 
human rights risks in our supply chain. We were able to conduct 13% more 
assessments in FY24 than FY23. In addition, over the last two fiscal years, we 
have audited around 73% of active subcontractors.
The most common category of nonconformance was health and safety 
(41%).1 After reviewing nonconformance issues with suppliers, we agreed on 
corrective action plans and followed up to ensure issues were addressed in 
a timely manner. Approximately 1% of assessment findings revealed zero-
tolerance issues.1

SOCIAL & LABOR CONVERGENCE PROGRAM (SLCP) PILOT
We believe that industry collaboration can help scale impact and increase 
progress, so we have been working with the SLCP and other brands to find 
a solution to support scaling their tool to small and upstream suppliers. 
In FY24, we participated in a working group that conducted 37 joint 
assessments, including nine at factories in Italy and one at a factory in  
China from which Ralph Lauren sources. These assessments included 
educating subject matter experts on the process and benefits of SLCP,  
then getting factory buy-in to complete SLCP independently moving 
forward. Overall, responses from participating factories were positive, and 
SLCP will collect additional feedback through surveys and focus groups.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
79% 
of our factories were assessed 
in FY24, representing 88% of our 
business volume
In addition to routinely conducted assessments, we initiate specialized 
assessments and deploy remediation tools or investigations based on 
actual or suspected risk. For example, in FY24 we received a grievance 
from a worker at a factory in Guatemala describing an ongoing issue with 
a supervisor’s communication style, specifically yelling on the production 
floor. Upon receiving this grievance, we investigated and resolved the issue in 
collaboration with factory management. However, given the escalation to the 
RL Hotline, we had concerns about how grievances were being managed by 
the factory, so it was important to assess the effectiveness of the operational-
level grievance process. As such, we commissioned a third-party audit to 
focus specifically on the factory grievance mechanism and worker awareness 
via a grievance tracking exercise. Our follow-up actions are addressing 
workers’ concerns and closing the gaps found in the grievance audit.

Materiality
Our GC&S approach is based on an assessment of the ESG risks, opportunities 
and impacts that are most material to our business, society and the 
environment. We regularly complete a materiality assessment to update our 
understanding of these factors as well as stakeholder expectations for  
our efforts.
The materiality assessment represented here was conducted in 2022 in 
partnership with the consulting firm BSR. The assessment engaged internal 
and external stakeholders through interviews, focus groups and surveys to 
analyze our Company’s impact on society and the environment, along with 
our enterprise value. Among the external stakeholders were environmental 
and social NGOs, supplier and licensee partners and global retailers. Internal 
stakeholders included employees across all functions, geographies and levels 
of the organization.

Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy
We do not tolerate bribery and corruption inside our organization or from 
our business partners. In addition to prohibiting these practices through our 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy (“ABC Policy”), we perform due diligence 
on new suppliers, maintain controls and routinely monitor and audit suppliers 
for compliance with applicable standards. In 2023, we reviewed best practices 
related to ABC policies and updated ours to reflect this.
RL Hotline
We are committed to promoting an environment of open, honest 
communication in our workplace, with our customers and business partners 
and in our supply chain. We encourage anyone to express concerns and 
provide the opportunity to file reports 24 hours a day, seven days a week 
through the RL Hotline, online or via phone. 
Each allegation and inquiry received through the RL Hotline is assessed to 
determine its impact and whether further investigation or other appropriate 
action is needed. RL Hotline metrics, including reports, are communicated 
routinely to the Board of Directors’ Audit Committee. We are committed to 
providing a safe reporting environment and do not tolerate retaliation against 
anyone who reports a concern in good faith. 
To support our commitment to human rights, we supplement this program 
for supply chain workers with the RL Grievance Mechanism program, which 
complements existing processes managed by the factories themselves. 
Information is made available on posters throughout factories (in local 
languages) and workers can escalate their concerns using the RL Hotline, 
accessible through a QR code.

Our Approach
We have a longstanding information security risk program aligned with the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework 
(NIST-CSF), industry-leading practices, privacy laws and global standards.  
Our program includes a defense-in-depth approach with multiple layers 
of security controls, including network segmentation, security monitoring, 
endpoint protection, identity and access management and data loss 
prevention controls. 
To help ensure the effectiveness and resilience of our cybersecurity measures, 
we actively engage with cybersecurity specialists for objective assessments 
of our cybersecurity program and practices, as well as to conduct targeted 
attack simulations. We continually enhance our information security 
capabilities to protect against emerging threats such as ransomware and 
third-party supply chain risk, while increasing our ability to detect and respond 
to cyber incidents and maximize our resilience to recover from potential 
cyber-attacks.
Central to our preparedness, we have a robust incident response plan in  
place that provides a documented playbook for handling high-severity 
cybersecurity incidents and facilitates coordination across multiple parts 
of our Company. We perform simulations at both a technical and leadership 
level at least annually. Our commitment to security extends to our employees 
through a comprehensive security awareness program, which includes regular 
phishing simulations and annual cybersecurity awareness and data protection 
training, as well as more personalized sessions for targeted users and roles. 
We complete annual internal security audits and vulnerability assessments of 
the Company’s information systems and related controls, including systems 
affecting personal data. Additionally, we leverage external cybersecurity 
specialists to complete annual independent audits against industry standards, 
such as the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), SOX IT General Controls 
and the Multi-Level Protection Scheme (MLPS) Standard. In addition, we 
undergo comprehensive assessments of our cybersecurity program’s maturity 
against NIST CSF.

Compliance and Regulations
Our Global Privacy Program, defined and led by the Chief Privacy Officer 
(CPO), focuses on the responsible and ethical handling of personal  
data in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, to maintain  
trust and confidence in our brand and reputation. Governed by a cross- 
functional Privacy Office which encompasses a Data Protection Officer and 
Regional Privacy Legal Counsels, this program prioritizes the privacy of the 
data of our customers, employees and partners, fostering a culture of  
privacy compliance. 
We have a data governance structure in place to monitor for new and/
or updated global directives and regulations related to data privacy, data 
protection, cyber security and data breaches. We make adjustments to both 
internal and external policies and programs to align with these requirements. 
In 2023, to strengthen our practices and governance around data, we 
established a new Data Ethics Committee and introduced a Data Governance 
Policy. We also require service providers who need to have access to personal 
information we maintain to comply with our Company’s policy. Our data 
privacy commitments are outlined in our Privacy Notices.
For business purposes, we collect, use and process personal data of 
individuals in North America, Europe and Asia. We consider leading data 
protection standards and best practices to help protect data, including that 
pertaining to our customers, employees and suppliers. Compliance with 
data protection and privacy laws across multiple jurisdictions is core to our 
values and strategy. Our Data Privacy Program is designed to be flexible and 
adaptable to comply with new laws and regulations that take effect in the 
jurisdictions where we conduct business. Examples include the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, the California Consumer Privacy 
Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) in the U.S., the ePrivacy 
Directive, Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (LGPD) and China’s Personal 
Information Protection Law (PIPL).

Approach to stakeholder engagement
We engage with our stakeholders at varying frequencies and in different 
formats to inform our citizenship and sustainability strategy. One of the many 
ways we accomplish this is by regularly completing a materiality assessment to 
update our understanding of these factors as well as stakeholder expectations 
for our efforts. 
 
Our latest materiality assessment was conducted in 2022 through consulting 
firm BSR. The assessment engaged internal and external stakeholders through 
interviews, focus groups and surveys to analyze our Company’s impact on 
society and the environment, along with our enterprise value. Among the 
external stakeholders were environmental and social non-governmental 
organizations, supplier and licensee partners and global retailers. Internal 
stakeholders included employees across all functions, all geographies and 
levels of the organization.

factors used: World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Energy 
consumption calculated for energy from natural gas, diesel, propane, fuel 
oil, electricity, steam and cooling consumed at owned and operated global 
retail stores, offices and distribution centers. Site-specific energy use is 
determined using a three-tiered system, depending on the availability of 
primary data for the fiscal year. If we have primary data for all months that 
a facility was operating in the fiscal year, the energy usage data is simply 
summed. If we have partial primary data, existing data is scaled based on 
geographic region and facility type to fill gaps. Finally, if we have no primary 
data, we model yearly energy using facility square footage and an energy use 
intensity based on the climate zone and facility type of primary data, scaled 
to fill gaps.

Significant impacts of activities, products, 
and services on biodiversity
Biodiversity impacts all aspects of our value chain. In FY24, we began 
leveraging the Science Based Targets (SBTs) for Nature methodology to shape 
our biodiversity goals and strategy. Specifically, we completed Steps 1 and 2, 
which included conducting a fashion and retail sector materiality assessment, 
determining where we have the greatest impact within our value chain given 
our material use, and prioritizing the areas of highest nature impact. Following 
the SBTs for Nature methodology, our assessment took a location-specific and 
commodity specific approach, examining the most pressing nature issues for 
Ralph Lauren — which include water quantity, water quality, soil pollution, land 
use change, land use and biodiversity — as well as identifying key raw materials 
to prioritize, in particular cotton and cashmere. As we continue on our nature 
strategy development journey, we will seek to engage our supply chain partners 
in our goals and initiatives. Our approach will be integrated and built upon our 
existing initiatives in areas such as climate change and water stewardship.

Nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and other 
significant air emissions
Nitrogen Oxides, Sulfur Oxides and other significant air pollutants may be 
generated from the use of fossil fuels, such as coal, in our supply chain. As part 
of our Climate strategy, since FY22, we have been expanding and accelerating 
decarbonization initiatives with our product manufacturing suppliers, including 
the supplier GHG reduction roadmap development, renewable energy program 
and coal phase out. In particular, we prioritize coal phase out from our Tier 1 
and Tier 2 manufacturing facilities by the end of 2025. In November 2022, we 
ceased onboarding any new facilities with on-site coal. For the existing facilities 
with on-site coal usage that are onboarded prior to November 2022, we require 
written coal phase out commitments and action plans from facilities and track 
their progress quarterly. Globally, we have identified 74 active on-site coal-
using facilities (Tier 1 and Tier 2), 35 of which have successfully phased out coal 
to date, with the rest on track to meet the 2025 goal.

Negative environmental impacts in supply 
chain and actions taken
We explicitly state in our Vendor Compliance and Operating Standards that 
all suppliers are expected to adhere to all applicable local and national laws 
as well as international regulations and standards in the operation of their 
business, and must conduct their operations consistent with applicable 
environmental laws and best practices. We have the right to terminate our 
business relationship should the supplier fail to comply with the applicable 
laws and regulations. In addition to that, we are screening our supply base 
for any potential significant environmental impacts through the Higg FEM 
and the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) Supervision 
platform (the latter is specific to China-based facilities). If an issue is found, 
we require the supplier to take corrective action and put in place preventive 
measures to avoid recurrence. Specifically, on any violation record found on 
the IPE platform, we also require the facilities — at a minimum — to publish 
enterprise feedback onto the platform, which details the corrective and 
preventive measures taken.
In FY24, we screened all our Tier 1, subcontracted processing and mills 
through these platforms. We identified eight facilities with potential 
significant environmental impacts related to permits, air emissions and 
wastewater standards. We do not use Higg FEM assessment results or IPE 
records to terminate business relationships with suppliers. We addressed all 
the identified facilities to ensure corrective action and preventive measures 
are in place.

Hazard identification, risk assessment, 
and incident investigation
Ralph Lauren Health & Safety conducts Job Hazard Analyses (JHAs) to identify 
work-related hazards (or potential for harm) through observation and safety 
assessments of specific tasks within a job or job function. A member of the 
Health & Safety team will work with the employee performing the task to assess 
the steps taken, tools used and environmental factors to determine an overall 
risk level and work to ensure that risk level is acceptable. Any uncontrolled 
hazards should be eliminated, as these could result in injury or illness. 
Employees are encouraged to notify their leadership of any work-related 
hazards, contact the Health & Safety team or use our anonymous internal 
Hotlines for immediate response. 
The Health & Safety team is represented in each of our North Carolina 
warehouse facilities where we have the largest workforce. Each member of 
the Health & Safety team is qualified to conduct JHAs, and has experience in 
hazard identification and communication.

MANAGEMENT OF CHEMICALS IN PRODUCTS	
Discussion of processes to maintain 
compliance with restricted  
substances regulations
CG-AA-250a.1
Ralph Lauren has Vendor Compliance Packets (VCP) for all mills and finished goods suppliers. 
The VCP states suppliers must comply with American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA) 
Restricted Substances List (RSL). We adopt the AAFA RSL to serve as a practical tool that 
sets forth specific chemical substance bans, limitations or test methods, as specified by 
government or regulatory agencies.
We test to the strictest global standard. Tests are performed through our Apparel Testing 
Program, which ensures our products meet compliance requirements, regardless of their 
markets of distribution. It also contains protocols on how tests should be conducted, 
including all fabrics, trims or related materials, apparel, accessories, footwear, home textiles 
and components that are supplied or sold to our Company for use in the manufacturing or 
distribution of any Ralph Lauren product. A zero tolerance policy is in effect on any product not 
meeting the RLC standards as defined in the protocol. Suppliers are required to use only Ralph 
Lauren-nominated independent third-party testing labs to achieve passing test reports for raw 
materials and finished products prior to the shipping of product.
We also use independent third-party labs to conduct raw material risk assessments of our lines 
each year to ensure our raw material suppliers are clear on our development standards and 
deliver fabric that will meet our compliance requirements.
Our three stages of testing are:
1.	 Fabric testing for apparel: The testing is required for bulk yardage in all colorways and 
where approved raw-material-risk-assessment exists. A completed and passing fabric 
test is valid for six months.
2.	Component testing for apparel, footwear and accessories: Suppliers are allowed to test 
the raw material and subcomponents used to produce an item. A completed and passing 
subcomponent test is valid for 12 months.
3.	 Finished goods testing for home, apparel and footwear: Finished goods testing must be 
done in bulk fabric with bulk trim items. A completed and passing finished goods test is 
valid for six months.
Discussion of processes to assess and  
manage risks and/or hazards associated  
with chemicals in products
CG-AA-250a.2
Our process for assessing and managing risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in 
products is described above. Policies and practices are fully aligned across our brands and 
product categories. As described above, all raw materials and finished products undergo 
testing to confirm compliance with regulations. Depending on the volume of orders, some 
styles may undergo more testing than others. We take a combination of hazard- and risk-
based approaches to chemical management. As mentioned above, we complete extensive 
risk assessments each year by raw material. We explicitly state in our Vendor Compliance 
and Operating Standards that all suppliers are expected to adhere to all applicable local 
and national laws as well as international regulations and standards in the operation of their 
business, and must conduct their operations consistent with applicable environmental laws 
and best practices. 
 
The third-party certifications used and our approach to chemical management at each 
stage of the product life cycle are discussed above. We partner with the Zero Discharge of 
Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) to work towards the alignment and collective action across 
the industry in monitoring and eliminating the usage and discharge of hazardous chemicals 
in textile, apparel and leather manufacturing, as well as promoting the development and 
adoption of safer chemical alternatives. We aim to eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals 
in our supply chain by the end of 2025. We fully adopt the ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted 
Substances List (MRSL) and have communicated expectations to our supply chain through 
our Sustainable Chemicals Management Policy, as well as our VCP. More details on our 
management of chemicals in products can be found in the Chemical Management section on 
page 41 of our 2024 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN
Percentage of (1) Tier 1 supplier facilities 
and (2) supplier facilities beyond Tier 1 in 
compliance with wastewater discharge permits 
and/or contractual agreement
CG-AA-430a.1
In FY24, all of Tier 1 direct supplier, subcontracted processing and Tier 2 facilities that 
reported on Higg Index FEM have valid wastewater discharge permits and/or contractual 
agreements for wastewater treatment. We explicitly state in our Vendor Compliance 
and Operating Standards that all suppliers are required to adhere to all applicable laws 
and regulations of the regions where they operate, included, but not limited to, the local 
environmental standards. We have the right to terminate our business relationship should 
the supplier fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations. Our compliance audit 
also includes the compliance with wastewater regulations as part of the health and safety 
requirement. Our main supply chain risks associated with the wastewater discharge are 
related to the usage of chemicals in production and the effluent treatment system put  
in place. 
 
Our supplier facilities implement effluent treatment methods in accordance with the 
local regulatory requirements. This may include operating an on-site effluent treatment 
plant (ETP), partnering with an off-site ETP and, for some, implementing a zero liquid 
discharge effluent treatment system. In addition to the regulatory compliance, we adopt 
the ZDHC MRSL and its suite of tools to guide and align our efforts to eliminate the use 
and discharge of hazardous chemicals with the industry’s standards and best practices. 
This includes the implementation of ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines, which goes beyond 
the regulatory compliance. The ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines provide clear guidance in 
effluent testing methods, parameters, limits and reporting approach as a way to confirm 
that our manufacturing facility is not discharging hazardous chemicals into the environment. 
We expanded the roll out of the ZDHC Wastewater Test in our supply base as part of our 
sustainable chemicals management initiative to monitor the facility’s conformance against 
the ZDHC MRSL. While the wastewater test is only a snapshot of the effluent quality of 
the facility, it ensures an annual monitoring that allows us to follow up and address any 
nonconformance from its source through a root cause analysis approach that aligns with 
the ZDHC. This helps inform both the facility and Ralph Lauren on targeted chemicals 
phase out at the facility level. Among our facilities, wastewater was tested in accordance 
with guidelines at 86% of Tier 1 facilities and 59% of our Tier 2 core fabric facilities (by 
business volume). Of those facilities, 72% tested wastewater for compliance with the ZDHC 
requirement and out of the substances screened, 99.7% comply with ZDHC standard.

has the biggest opportunity 
to contribute to SDGs. For
