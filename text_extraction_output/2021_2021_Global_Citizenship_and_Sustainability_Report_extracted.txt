Dear Stakeholders, 
The past year will forever be associated with change and challenge, but it has also been a time to focus on what matters most. The convergence 
of the global pandemic, climate crisis and call to action to dismantle systemic racism has been a catalyst for businesses around the world to 
focus and accelerate their progress toward a more equitable and sustainable future.
At Ralph Lauren, our Purpose – to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style – anchors our journey to Design 
the Change; our teams drive our work forward; and we scale our impact through collaboration and partnership. Amid all the challenges we faced 
this year emerged a spirit of resilience, dedication and passion that has helped us to not only make progress on our goals and commitments, but 
accelerate our momentum.
As the world evolves, we will continue to listen, learn and challenge ourselves to lead and deliver on our Purpose in a way that creates value for 
all stakeholders. While there is still more work to be done, our impact can be seen through some of the strides we made this year, including:
•	 Establishing a clear roadmap to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040;
•	 Taking action to address racial inequity, both inside our Company and as a voice and leader in our industry;
•	 Launching our comprehensive circularity strategy;
•	 Launching and open-sourcing the first phase of Color on Demand, a revolutionary platform that more sustainably dyes cotton;
•	 Increasing our overall transparency by sharing expanded workforce diversity data, climate impact data and factory disclosures; and
•	 Incorporating key ESG metrics into our executive remuneration, from Fiscal 2022 onwards.
For more than 50 years, the notion of timelessness has defined our business and our brand — and this reverence for things that last extends 
to our culture, our communities and the wider world. That is why we are committed to accelerating and sharing our progress – designing the 
change needed for a better tomorrow.

Global Citizenship & Sustainability Governance
Global Citizenship & Sustainability governance is integrated across all 
levels of our organization.
Our Board of Directors (the Board) is responsible for formal 
governance of Global Citizenship & Sustainability. The Board receives 
progress updates at least once a year and reviews our annual Global 
Citizenship & Sustainability Report. Various Board committees have 
additional responsibilities:
•	 The Nominating, Governance, Citizenship & Sustainability 
Committee oversees our environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) risks and opportunities. The committee receives quarterly 
updates; reviews initiatives, goals and policies; and makes 
recommendations to the Board on ESG matters. Each quarterly 
update includes a detailed analysis on a specific ESG topic. 
•	 The Finance Committee and the Nominating Committee advise 
on the incorporation of goals into our corporate strategy and 
engagement of business initiatives that influence corporate 
citizenship and sustainability. 
•	 The Audit Committee assesses ESG risks as part of its overall 
Enterprise Risk Management review.
•	 The Compensation Committee considers performance against 
Company ESG key performance indicators in their compensation 
decisions.
Our Global Citizenship & Sustainability Senior Steering Committee is 
chaired by our Chief Product and Sustainability Officer and includes 
leaders from across the Company. The committee meets monthly to 
prioritize our approach and allocate resources. Committee members 
also define, track and champion our citizenship and sustainability 
work, including diversity and inclusion, with their teams. 
PRIORITY MATERIAL ISSUES
•	 Chemical Use & Discharge
•	 Climate Change
•	 Diversity & Inclusion
•	 Employee & Worker Health, Safety & Well-Being
•	 Raw Material Sourcing & Traceability
•	 Sustainable Product Design & Packaging
•	 Waste Management
•	 Water Stewardship
MATERIALITY AND STAKEHOLDER 
ENGAGEMENT
We regularly conduct materiality assessments to help identify 
and prioritize the citizenship and sustainability issues, risks and 
opportunities that matter most to our business and stakeholders. 
Our assessments are conducted by a third party and include 
extensive engagement with internal and external stakeholders, 
including employees, selected licensees, suppliers, partners, NGOs 
and consumers. Our most recent assessment, conducted in FY19, 
informed the development of our Design the Change strategy, 
including our priority material issues listed below and associated 
goals. Our next formal assessment will be conducted in FY22. 
We also maintain ongoing stakeholder engagement throughout the 
year to inform strategies, priority issues and goals in-between our 
formal materiality assessments. We also communicate regularly with 
investors on environmental, social and governance issues, typically 
through the regular course of investor meetings or one-off meeting 
requests.
We invite the public to provide feedback on our sustainability program 
through GlobalCorporateCommunications@RalphLauren.com.

All of our design, production and merchant teams will 
receive annual training on sustainable, circular, inclusive and 
culturally aware design
ONGOING GOAL
We commit to embedding sustainability, 
inclusivity and cultural awareness and 
celebration into the products and services 
we design.
Responsible Design
We challenge ourselves to think differently about each stage of the 
design and development process. This helps us create innovative 
products with timelessness, authenticity and quality at their heart. 
In FY21, we launched our Design with Intent program, which aims to 
identify and pursue opportunities to be intentional and impactful 
with all that Ralph Lauren represents—from product inception to 
marketing and every point along the customer journey, including 
store design and e-commerce. Our Design with Intent committee, 
with more than 60 members globally, drives our work in this area by 
bringing together diverse voices to inform the choices we make and 
the stories we tell. 
In FY21, we also rolled out e-learning on sustainable product design 
and cultural awareness to all our design, production and merchant 
teams globally, meeting our goal for FY21.
ACHIEVED FOR FY21
Our Approach to Design
We strive to create and communicate 
with respect and we continue to educate 
our teams and celebrate the cultures and 
influences that inspire our brands. 
Our designs are inspired by the world around us, including the 
landscapes, people and places we see each day. The breadth and 
reach of our brands across generations and cultures creates a style 
that is authentic, timeless and truly personal. We take seriously our 
responsibility to use the inspiration that captivates our imagination in 
a way that is culturally aware and appropriate. 
Our Cultural Awareness Guidelines define our approach. We update 
these annually and distribute them to all teams with a role in 
design, advertising and marketing. We support our teams to apply 
the guidelines in practice with our cultural awareness educational 
program; this program is mandatory as part of our new hire 
onboarding process for all creative, design, marketing and advertising 
teams. Existing teams receive annual training and special workshops 
to keep current in this space.  
In FY21, we expanded our Cultural Awareness Advisory Council 
to support our organization’s end-to-end process—from concept 
through to campaign—ensuring our creators have ongoing access 
to diverse expertise and insight. The Cultural Awareness Advisory 
Council is made up of 30 members—an international and diverse 
group of Ralph Lauren Corporation employees. Members include 
representatives from different teams around the world, such 
as Brand, Design, Marketing, Social and PR, Digital, Corporate 
Communications, D&I, RL Library and Legal. The Council also 
includes advisory members from the D&I Employee Resource 
Groups, providing guidance and feedback specific, but not limited 
to, multicultural experiences, race, ethnicity, gender, LGBTQIA+ and 
disability. 
We seek external advice and input to help us respect and support the 
many sources of inspiration we represent through our brand. Our 
advisors include the Smithsonian National Museum of the American 
Indian and the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health. 
As a member of the Nest Coalition for Craft & Culture, a group of 
peers committed to engaging responsibly and creatively with the 
global handcraft community, we’re working to convene a virtual event 
program focusing on capacity building and market access for U.S.-
based Indigenous Artisans.

Our Circular Strategy
We are committed to responsible design and sourcing principles to 
create more sustainable products that are worn, loved and made to 
last. Anchored in this commitment and in our long-standing vision of 
timeless style, in FY21 we launched a comprehensive circular strategy. 
The strategy will inform our product development and support more 
circular systems in our industry by designing out waste and pollution, 
keeping products and materials in use and regenerating natural 
systems. 
Building on our current sustainability work, our new circularity 
strategy and associated targets will focus on three pillars:
CREATE CIRCULAR CONSUMER 
EXPERIENCES    
Building on the launch of our first subscription apparel rental 
initiative, The Lauren Look, we will offer more circular experiences 
for consumers. We will expand our product offerings on re-commerce 
opportunities, increase recycling and upcycling options, as well as 
enhancing vintage selling capabilities.
DESIGN PRODUCTS FOR CIRCULARITY   
We will review select iconic products—including best sellers such as 
polo shirts, chinos, denim and sweaters—for longevity and circularity 
using the holistic Cradle to Cradle (C2C) standardTM. We will apply 
our learning to bring circular design principles to other key product 
categories in the future.
Circularity
Five of our iconic products will be C2C CertifiedTM
2025 GOAL
ADVANCE A CIRCULAR PRODUCT ECONOMY   
To help our industry meaningfully shift from a linear to a circular 
product economy, we will continue to invest in scalable technologies 
that elevate the quality of recycled materials to match the quality 
and feel of virgin material. In FY21, we invested in Natural Fiber 
Welding, Inc., a leading sustainable material science start-up that is 
scaling a new industry standard for natural fiber recycling.
2025 GOAL
Produce 100 percent recycled cotton products of high quality
Begin providing resale and recycling experiences for 
our consumers
2022 GOAL

2025 GOAL
2025 GOAL
We commit to using more materials 
in a way that results in positive social 
and environmental outcomes, protects 
biodiversity, advances animal welfare and 
continuously improves the traceability of 
our raw materials. 
Sustainable Materials
1 Key materials include cotton, polyester, viscose, leather, wool, cashmere and down. 
Our focus on quality and authenticity drives us to look for more 
sustainable raw materials—always with durability, craftsmanship 
and performance in mind. Our sustainable material strategy is 
driven by our ethos of creating positive environmental and social 
outcomes through the products we make. We continue to explore new 
innovations in material development that enable us to scale positive 
impacts.
We are increasingly evaluating how our material sourcing can address 
more complex social and environmental challenges. Preferred fiber 
certifications help drive best practices and verify sustainability 
claims. We recognize the importance of supporting fiber production 
that contributes to ecosystem functioning and soil health to 
support a sustainable and profitable fiber industry. A key aspect 
of our sustainable materials strategy is to grow the adoption of 
regenerative agricultural practices in our leather and cotton supply 
chains through partnerships and direct-to-grower sourcing models. 
COMMITTING TO NATURE
We are committed to deploying nature-based solutions 
through our business operations and product supply chains. 
To do this, engaging in collective industry action will be 
essential. We are working with the G7 Fashion Pact to restore 
biodiversity, participating in Textile Exchange’s biodiversity 
benchmark as we develop a biodiversity strategy and setting 
commitments to science-based targets for nature and zero 
deforestation. Nature-based solutions are also tightly tied to 
our raw materials sourcing and net zero goals as we look to 
accelerate the adoption of regeneratively grown materials 
and further support farmers, who are drawing down carbon, 
through carbon credits.
Guided by our sustainable raw material road map, we are working 
toward our 2025 goals for overall sourcing and specific material types. 
In FY21, we continued to increase transparency and traceability of our 
material use by:
•	 Beginning to map our supply chain to enable visibility of material 
origins across each step of the textile and garment supply chain 
to inform a robust sourcing strategy, provide assurance of 
sustainability impacts and mitigate risk.
•	 Developing systems to measure the total volume (by weight) of 
sustainable materials as a portion of total raw materials sourced, 
which will enable us to systematically track their sustainable 
attributes.
In FY21, 33 percent of our units produced met our sustainable 
material criteria—up from 11 percent in FY20.

Progress Toward More Sustainable Materials
COTTON
Cotton accounts for more than 80 percent of our total material use. 
We are committed to sourcing cotton in a manner that prioritizes 
soil health, utilizes water efficiently, minimizes chemical inputs and 
supports workers’ rights and farmers’ profitability. 
Aligned with our FY21 goal, we continued to transition core 
products—such as polo shirts, knits, chinos and shirts—to 
sustainably sourced cotton. In FY21, we sourced more than 9,000 
metric tons of cotton lint sourced as Better Cotton, a 42 percent 
increase from last year. As a Better Cotton Initiative member, 
we support its mission to address the environmental, social and 
economic issues associated with growing cotton. 
Organic cotton fiber makes up less than 1 percent of cotton grown 
annually. Farmers who want to switch from conventional to certified 
organic farming face financial challenges and other barriers and must 
use organic farming methods for a two- to three-year transitional 
period before achieving certification. Toward our 2025 goal, we will 
introduce transitional cotton into our collections to support farmers 
during this period and to help drive the growth of organic cotton 
supply globally. 
We also aim to increase the use of U.S.-grown cotton in our products. 
To support increased sourcing of sustainably grown cotton from 
the U.S., we are working at the industry and farm levels to support 
healthy soils through regenerative practices, such as cover crops and 
reduced tillage, while increasing farmer profitability. 
 
HARNESSING INNOVATION TO SCALE 
MORE SUSTAINABLE COTTON
As part of our new circular strategy, we are working to 
scale technologies that will elevate the quality of recycled 
materials to match that of virgin material. 
For example, through our investment in Natural Fiber 
Welding, Inc., in FY22 we will launch first-of-its-kind 
performance apparel utilizing Clarus cotton yarn. Clarus is 
made using an innovative process that welds short fibers 
into longer durable fibers to create high performance 
materials with the drying power and breathability often 
associated with synthetics.

================================================================================
[PAGE 13 OF 64]
================================================================================
POLYESTER AND NYLON
We are working to phase out virgin sources of polyester and nylon and 
switch to recycled options or natural fibers. 
Polyester is a synthetic material produced from fossil fuels. It 
currently accounts for 6.5 percent of our total material use, and in 
FY21, 23 percent of our polyester was recycled. 
In FY21, we:
•	 Focused on transitioning outerwear and swimwear lines to recycled 
polyester, including some swimwear previously made from nylon. 
•	 Transitioned the Polo Pony logo to recycled thread. In FY21, we 
used more than 432 million meters of recycled thread.
•	 Started mapping our polyester use to identify opportunities to 
reduce and replace it with innovative alternatives. 
We are also reducing plastic waste through the use of recycled 
polyester. By 2025, we commit to using at least 170 million recycled 
plastic bottles in our products and packaging. In FY21, we repurposed 
more than 21.9 million recycled bottles—including 1.8 million through 
our partnership with First Mile™ to produce The Earth Polo.2 To date, 
we have used more than 40 million bottles.
In FY21, we continued transitioning to recycled nylon for some of our 
outerwear lines. Most of our Polo outerwear styles now use recycled 
materials. In select RLX outerwear, we use Econyl®—a 100 percent 
recycled nylon made from pre- and post-consumer waste.
VISCOSE
Viscose is a wood-based fiber that, when not sourced responsibly,  
has been connected to the deforestation of ancient and endangered 
forests. We are committed to sustainable sourcing of viscose, as 
described in our Forest Protection Policy.
In FY21, viscose made up less than 1 percent of our material use. Of 
the viscose we used, 10 percent has been verified as sourced from 
manufacturers who have been deemed low-risk according to Canopy’s 
annual Hot Button Report. We aim to increase this percentage 
by improving the visibility of our viscose supply chain. In FY21, we 
began mapping our viscose fiber manufacturers, and in FY22, we will 
engage the viscose suppliers who have not signed on to CanopyStyle 
and encourage them to participate in the third-party audit as we 
prioritize sourcing from low-risk suppliers, working toward our goal 
of having 100 percent of our viscose sustainably sourced and verified 
through CanopyStyle audits by 2025.
ANIMAL-DERIVED MATERIALS
Around 3 percent of our total material use comes from animal-
derived sources, most of which are by-products from other 
industries. We are committed to the well-being and respectful 
treatment of animals, as described in our Animal Welfare Policy, which 
includes our approach to sourcing exotic skins and our long-standing 
ban on the use of fur. In FY21, we updated our policy with an increased 
focus on traceability. 
We recognize that leather, wool and cashmere production have 
the potential to contribute to negative or positive environmental 
outcomes. We are determined to source these materials sustainably, 
with low-stress animal handling and regenerative grazing practices to 
enhance ecosystem functioning and productivity. We evaluate non-
animal alternatives where these materials align with our sustainability 
principles. We are also members of the Southeast Asian Reptile 
Conservation Alliance, which advocates for a reptile skin trade 
that maintains wild reptile populations, supports local and national 
economies and promotes animal welfare principles.
LEATHER
In calendar year 2020, 53 percent of our leather manufacturers were 
certified by the Leather Working Group (LWG), accounting for 89 
percent of our total leather use.
To support more sustainable leather sourcing, we engage in the 
Leather Impact Accelerator—a program dedicated to aligning 
members of the leather value chain to achieve meaningful sustainable 
impacts. We advanced our work on transparency and traceability in 
FY21 by benchmarking all the tanneries in our supply chain and joining 
the LWG transparency task force.
To support regenerative and holistic land management, we are 
researching and developing cattle and bison leather options through a 
direct sourcing model.

================================================================================
[PAGE 14 OF 64]
================================================================================
DOWN
One hundred percent of the down sourced for products 
manufactured by Ralph Lauren suppliers is certified by the 
Responsible Down Standard (RDS) or the Traceable Down Standard 
(TDS). 
We also use Primaloft’s® ThermoPlume® down alternative—made 
from recycled plastic bottles—in select outerwear, such as our 
custom packable jacket. In FY21, we repurposed 3.6 million plastic 
bottles using this technology. 
CASHMERE 
We finalized our cashmere strategy in FY21 and became a member 
of the Sustainable Fibre Alliance (SFA). Our strategy will initially 
focus on sourcing preferred fiber (including SFA certified cashmere) 
to address animal welfare and land management risks and recycled 
cashmere to minimize waste and reduce overall environmental impact 
from virgin production. We will engage in project-based initiatives in 
cashmere-growing regions to support systemic change and grassland 
restoration.
WOOL
In FY21, we prioritized the use of existing wool fabric and yarn stocks 
instead of purchasing new. As a result, we had limited progress 
toward our Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) certified fiber goal. 
Although our use of RWS certified wool was limited, we took steps to 
accelerate its future use by incorporating recycled wool into FY22

In FY21, we began formalizing our approach to creating more 
sustainable spaces in our stores. Our goal is to ensure all the key 
elements in our new store interiors—including fixtures, displays, 
flooring, hangers and signage—are sustainably sourced and made 
from materials that minimize environmental impact and maximize 
occupant health.
We base our approach on guidelines from leading green building and 
sourcing organizations, including the U.S. Green Building Council 
(USGBC) and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).
Our initial focus is on wood substrates (solids, veneers and 
composites). Consistent with our Forest Protection Policy, we set 
a 2025 goal for 100 percent of the wood substrates used in key 
elements of new store interiors to be FSC certified, repurposed 
or recycled. We have started to track the percentage of key wood 
suppliers3 for store design and construction that meet this standard. 
As our work on sustainable spaces progresses, we will assess other 
key areas for future focus and goal development.
Sustainable Spaces
We are committed to designing and 
building Ralph Lauren stores with 
materials that minimize environmental 
impact and maximize occupant health.

Eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals in our supply chain
2025 GOAL
We monitor and reduce hazardous chemical 
use and discharge and we are working to 
eliminate all hazardous chemicals from our 
product manufacturing.
Chemical Management
We have a responsibility to ensure the chemicals used to make our 
products are safe for people and the environment. Our Sustainable 
Chemical Management Policy guides our approach to assessing the 
potential impacts of the chemicals used in our supply chain and to 
partnering with our suppliers on responsible chemical management. 
The responsible use of chemicals is an industrywide challenge that 
requires collaboration between companies, their suppliers and third 
parties. As Friends of the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals 
(ZDHC) Programme, we collaborate with peers and experts to 
eliminate the use and discharge of hazardous chemicals across the 
apparel supply chain. 
We adopted the ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted Substances List 
(MRSL) in FY20 so our suppliers can track and report on all chemicals 
used to develop and manufacture our products and to prioritize 
harmful chemicals for removal. In FY21, we shared the MRSL and 
broader guidance on chemical management with all our suppliers. 
We also rolled out chemical inventory management tools with our 
strategic and key wet processing facilities to increase visibility of 
chemical usage and move toward full MRSL conformance. 
At the end of FY21, we gained visibility of chemical usage and MRSL 
conformance status of strategic and key facilities and top mills, 
representing approximately 31 percent of our supply chain spend. Of 
the chemicals reported, 59 percent conform with the ZDHC MRSL. 
We are working closely with our suppliers to achieve full conformance 
by 2025. We also require suppliers with wet processing facilities to 
test wastewater against ZDHC wastewater guidelines and share 
results on the ZDHC Gateway portal. Seventy-two percent of the 
facilities that tested comply with the ZDHC requirement, and out 
of the substances screened, 99.8 percent comply with the ZDHC 
standard.
In FY21, we assessed our suppliers’ chemical management, along 
with other environmental impact data, through the Sustainable 
Apparel Coalition Higg Index Facility Environment Module. In FY22, 
third-party-verified results of the Facility Environment Module (FEM)
assessment, combined with supplier conformance to the ZDHC MRSL 
and the wastewater standards, will be incorporated into our supplier 
performance evaluation scorecard and will help inform business 
decisions. Read more about our work to align our suppliers to Higg in 
Supplier Engagement. 
As part of our commitment to phase out all chemicals of concern 
from our supply chain, we continue to prioritize specific chemicals 
for elimination. In FY21, we began phasing out the use of per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)-based coating in our water-
repellent fabrics, targeting full elimination by FY22. We also aim to 
phase out polyvinyl chloride (PVC) by the end of FY22, which will 
contribute to the phase out of phthalates, the plasticizers commonly 
used to make PVC.
WORKING TOWARD MORE 
SUSTAINABLE DENIM
Conventional denim production requires significant water 
consumption and the use of potentially harmful chemicals to 
grow cotton and to dye and wash finished products. 
In FY21, we continued transitioning to a more sustainable 
denim production, including increasing recycled cotton and 
recycled polyester content in our jeans and working to verify 
the origin of select cotton used for denim. In FY21, suppliers 
representing 47 percent of our denim business spend have 
started to implement new processes, reducing:
•	 Water-intensive chemical use in the production of our 
core denim products.
•	 The use of potassium permanganate to wash our denim, 
with the aim of phasing it out by the end of FY22.
•	 The use of pumice stones for our core denim washes 
by 80 percent, with the goal of fully eliminating pumice 
stones by 2025.
We are also exploring the use of natural indigo dye to replace 
current synthetic options. In FY21, we partnered with Stoney 
Creek Farm in Tennessee and our supplier, Cone Mills, to 
test a natural plant-based indigo dye on a men’s Polo style. 
Natural indigo production enables farmers to diversify crops 
and support regenerative, sustainable agriculture. This bio-
based alternative to synthetic petroleum-based indigo also 
has the benefit of predictable and consistent coloring.

Our Climate Strategy
Today we face a climate crisis. As part of our commitment to the 
climate goals set forth in the Paris Agreement, we know ambitious 
near-term action to decarbonize our operations and value chain 
should be matched with long-term ambition. In June 2020, we set 
a 2030 goal to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with 
the global reductions needed to limit average temperature rise to 
1.5 degrees Celsius. We are now looking beyond 2030 and beyond the 
reductions we can achieve across our own value chain to achieve net 
zero GHG emissions by 2040. As part of this strategy, we will begin to 
scale investment in carbon removals in FY22, with plans to increase 
those removals through 2040 and maintain net zero GHG emissions 
thereafter. 
Our 2030 GHG reduction goal was approved by the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi) and we have aligned our net zero strategy 
with the SBTi’s Foundations for Net-Zero Target Setting. For details 
on our climate strategy and net zero target, see Ralph Lauren’s Net 
Zero Commitment. 
Carbon & Energy
Achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040
2040 GOAL
Reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 30 
percent by 2030 from a FY20 base year. As part of this 
goal, Ralph Lauren commits to sourcing 100 percent 
renewable electricity by 2025.
2030 GOAL
We are committed to playing our part to 
address the climate crisis by reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions across our 
value chain and investing in credible 
emission removals.

1We measure and calculate our emissions according to the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol, the industry standard and international tool for carbon accounting. For a more detailed 
methodology, see our ESG Supplement.
2 Our FY20 carbon footprint has been updated since the original release of our FY20 Global Citizenship & 
Sustainability Report to reflect improved data methodology, including corrected electricity consumption 
at one of our distribution centers, more accurate estimates of manufacturing emissions and a more 
complete estimation of fabric mill emissions.
Since improving our calculation methodology last year, we began 
tracking progress toward our 2030 goal by measuring the carbon 
footprint of our entire value chain. Our Scope 3 emissions accounted 
for 92 percent of our total footprint in FY21, with Scope 1 and 2 
accounting for the remainder.
Our Scope 1 and 2 carbon footprints consist mainly of emissions from 
electricity and fuels for heating and cooling the facilities in our direct 
operations, plus a smaller portion from refrigerant emissions. In FY21, 
our operational energy consumption decreased to 260,247 MWh, 
which resulted in 92,986 MTCO2e. The energy intensity of our owned 
and operated stores was 32.1 kWh/sq ft.
Our Scope 3 carbon footprint consists of indirect emissions from our 
global supply chain. In FY21, our total Scope 3 emissions decreased to 
1,144,031 MTCO2e.
The evolving situation surrounding COVID-19 and ongoing high level 
of uncertainty has led to business disruptions that are reflected 
in our overall carbon footprint. Overall, our absolute emissions 
decreased by 34 percent in FY21. These changes are driven by 
production volumes decreasing by over 30 percent compared to 
FY20, which contributes significantly to our Scope 3 emissions 
from manufacturing and raw materials. We remain committed to 
implementing our GHG action plan for achieving and maintaining a 30 
percent reduction in our carbon footprint by 2030. More detail on our 
carbon footprint is available in our ESG Supplement.
RENEWABLE ENERGY
Moving to 100 percent renewable electricity for our owned and 
operated facilities is essential to meeting our Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
reduction goal.
In FY21, 6 percent of electricity used in our operations was from 
renewable sources, such as wind power, compared with 2 percent in 
FY20. This improvement resulted from increased renewable energy 
attribute certificate purchases in North America and Europe.
To drive more rapid progress toward our 2030 goal, we adjusted 
our renewables strategy in FY21 to focus on virtual power 
purchase agreements (VPPA) in North America, while also seeking 
opportunities to support community solar projects close to the 
communities where we operate. For any remaining renewable 
electricity needs, we will source renewable energy credits (RECs) and 
equivalent certificates in Europe and Asia. We expect to sign our first 
VPPA in FY22.
We are members of RE100—a global group of influential businesses 
committed to achieving 100 percent renewable energy—and we align 
our renewable sourcing with RE100’s new market boundary criteria. 
In FY21, we joined the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance and signed 
the Energy Buyer Federal Clean Energy Policy statement, which calls 
upon the federal government to transition to zero-carbon energy. 
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
We continue to improve the energy efficiency of our stores and 
offices. We are focused on reducing energy-intensive components like 
lighting, heating and cooling through energy management systems 
and by installing more efficient technology. 
In FY21, we retrofitted 76 stores in North America, Europe and Asia 
to use energy-efficient LED lighting and installed LED lighting in an 
additional 61 new stores. By the end of FY22, all of our retail stores 
in Europe will be equipped with efficient lighting. In FY21, our stores 
consumed 173,220 MWh of energy and their carbon intensity was 
0.012 MTCO2e/sq ft—a 16 percent decrease compared with FY20.
In FY22, we will begin to deploy new energy management systems at 
retail stores in North America. This will allow us to more accurately 
track energy use and adjust our lighting, heating and cooling for 
greater efficiency.

================================================================================
Activities in our supply chain are the greatest contributors to 
our carbon footprint. We are working across materials sourcing, 
manufacturing and distribution to reduce our GHG emissions.	
Our next step is to integrate strategic road maps for these key 
focus areas into an overall strategy for reducing our supply chain 
carbon footprint.
 
Carbon & Energy: Our Supply Chain
TRANSPORTATION & DISTRIBUTION
Our Scope 3 footprint includes emissions from product 
transport, such as train, ship and air freight. To mitigate cost and 
environmental impact, we prioritize efficiency when choosing how 
to transport products to our distribution centers. We only allow 
vendors to deliver products by air in rare circumstances, such as 
when production does not meet delivery deadlines and there is a 
risk to keeping our promise to our customers.
We are signatories to the Ocean Conservancy Arctic Shipping 
Pledge, which commits us not to hire carriers to ship our products 
through Arctic Trans-Shipment Routes. And we engage with Clean 
Cargo, a BSR collaboration for sustainable transportation, and 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency SmartWay program on 
efficient logistics. 
In FY21, air freight managed directly by Ralph Lauren was 6.7 percent 
compared with 3.8 percent in FY20. This increase was due to a 
combination of factors, including efforts not to buy ahead and create 
excess stock and time constraints linked to factory closures or delays 
as a result of COVID-19. In FY21, vendor-managed air accounted for 
2.4 percent of total shipments, compared with 3.8 percent in FY20.
From FY22, our logistics provider selection process will include a 
sustainability scorecard that measures candidates’ sustainability 
practices—from the presence of a company sustainability strategy to 
performance measurement and continuous improvement plans.
RAW MATERIALS
Our strategy for reducing emissions from our raw materials focuses 
on switching to preferred fibers that result in fewer emissions than 
those that are conventionally grown. We are evaluating our fiber 
portfolio and creating annual preferred fiber usage goals. We aim 
to increase our use of recycled materials and fibers grown using 
regenerative land management practices, which will have multiple 
benefits for carbon sequestration, biodiversity and ecosystem 
functioning. Read more in Sustainable Materials.
MANUFACTURING & PROCESSING
In FY21, we gathered environmental impact data, including energy 
and emissions, from our strategic and key suppliers through the 
Sustainable Apparel Coalition’s Higg Index Facility Environment 
Module. Results from this assessment are shared in 	
	
Supplier Engagement.
In FY21, five of the largest fabric mills in our supply chain 
continued their journey through the Apparel Impact Institute 
(AII) Mill/Impact program, which focuses on achieving sustainable 
reductions to mill carbon, water and chemical footprints. All 
five mills completed on-site expert visits to identify efficiency 
improvement opportunities, which they will begin implementing to 
realize carbon reductions.
Our next step is to expand engagement with our suppliers through 
collective actions and strategic programs that drive emissions 
reductions in manufacturing facilities, aligned with our science-
based target. 
In FY21, we also made progress reducing transportation emissions 
for raw materials and manufacturing by developing local-to-local 
supply chains. We are working to consolidate our supply chain, with 
a goal for 80 percent of our business to be with strategic and key 
suppliers by 2025.

Our Water Stewardship Strategy
CONSERVATION
In FY21, we continued to collaborate with the World Wildlife Fund 
(WWF) to advance our work in this area and set a comprehensive 
strategy for water stewardship and water use reductions in our value 
chain. We analyzed our value chain through the WWF Water Risk Filter 
to map key areas of water risk and develop a water footprint. The 
analysis also identified opportunities for watershed conservation, 
reduced water consumption and improved community access to water.
Our goal to reduce water use by at least 20 percent by 2025 relates 
to manufacturing and processing in our supply chain and water use 
in our owned and operated facilities, compared to a FY20 baseline of 
14,870,315 m3. In FY21, our footprint was 9,661,765 m3—a 34 percent 
reduction compared to FY20. This decrease was primarily driven 
by COVID-19-related business impacts, such as production volumes 
decreasing by over 30 percent compared to FY20, which contributes 
significantly to our supply chain water consumption. More details on 
our water footprint is available in our ESG Supplement.
In our manufacturing supply chain, we focus on improving water use 
efficiency while also considering the shared basin-level water needs 
where our suppliers’ fabric mills, factories and laundries are located. 
We are setting contextual water targets to better align our reduction 
goal with surrounding water challenges. In priority water-stressed 
locations, we are contributing to collective action projects with WWF 
and local partnerships and experts to scale water use assessments 
and reduction strategies. 
Freshwater is an essential resource for people and wildlife, and a 
foundation for healthy ecosystems and thriving economies. It’s also 
a resource that the apparel industry is heavily reliant on—from 
growing cotton to dyeing and washing fabric. Our approach to water 
stewardship includes actions that address overall use and quality, as 
well as protecting watersheds and ensuring access. 
Water Stewardship

WATER STEWARDSHIP IN OUR SUPPLY 
CHAIN
We are working with our product manufacturers to use more water-
efficient production methods and to capture water data through the 
Sustainable Apparel Coalition Higg Index Facility Environment Module.
The five tier 2 fabric mills we enrolled in the Apparel Impact Institute 
Mill/Impact program are progressing through an 18-month process 
to reduce their overall environmental impact, including water use. 
The most recent focus is on efficiency measures, including optimizing 
the recovery of steam condensate and cooling water, maximizing the 
reuse of manufacturing process water and advancing wastewater 
treatment systems. Preliminary results show 8 to 20 percent 
reductions in water use, with the investment payback period ranging 
from 5 to 26 months. 
Other water stewardship initiatives in FY21 include:
•	 Continuing our partnership with knit and woven manufacturers to 
minimize water use and improve effluent treatment by upgrading 
factory processing and equipment. 
•	 Continuing to reduce the use of water-intensive chemicals and 
processing in the production of our core denim products. 
•	 Launching Color on Demand, a revolutionary dyeing platform to 
color cotton more sustainably, using less water, less dye and less 
energy (see case study right). 
REVOLUTIONIZING COTTON DYEING
Each year, trillions of liters of water are used for fabric 
dyeing alone, generating around 20 percent of wastewater 
worldwide. This water often requires lengthy, costly 
treatment to make it reusable.
We brought together four leading innovators in their 
respective fields—Dow, Jeanologia, Huntsman Textile Effects 
and COROB—to reimagine each stage of the coloring process 
and join a shared mission to create a more sustainable and 
efficient system for cotton dyeing. 
The result is Color on Demand. This new multi-phased 
platform is composed of a set of innovative technologies 
that will enable the recycling and reuse of all water from the 
dyeing process, establishing the world’s first scalable zero-
wastewater cotton dyeing system. In addition to significant 
water savings, Color on Demand dramatically reduces the 
amount of chemicals, dye, time and energy used in the cotton 
dyeing process. 
As part of the first phase of Color on Demand, we optimized 
the use of ECOFASTTM Pure—a pre-treatment solution for 
cotton garments, developed by Dow. When used with existing 
dyeing equipment, ECOFAST™ Pure enables the use of up 
to 40 percent less water, 85 percent fewer chemicals, 90 
percent less energy and a 60 percent reduction in carbon 
footprint compared to traditional cotton dyeing processes. 
In partnership with Dow, we are releasing a detailed manual 
about ECOFAST™ Pure to encourage industry adoption and 
help standardize more sustainable cotton dyeing.
By 2025, we aim to use the Color on Demand platform in 
more than 80 percent of our solid cotton products. This 
revolutionary system will transform how the fashion industry 
colors cotton—more sustainably, more effectively and faster 
than ever.
To learn more about Color on Demand, watch here.
COTTON 
As part of our water stewardship strategy, we evaluated the impacts 
of cotton farming. We looked at our key cotton growing regions 
through the WWF Water Risk Filter to identify geographies with 
high risk for water scarcity. We also estimated total water use 
(rainfed and irrigated) in cotton agriculture—the volume used is 
significant and our focus is on both reducing water use in cotton 
production and increasing effectiveness of water use. A key driver 
of this is the adoption of regenerative farming practices that make 
better use of rainfall and irrigated land. These practices increase soil 
fertility, water holding capacity and carbon capture; reduce erosion 
and pollution runoff; and create more resilience against floods and 
droughts. Read more about our work to increase the adoption of 
more sustainable cotton. 
COMMUNITY
Essential to our overall water stewardship strategy is supporting 
watershed health through conservation interventions—including 
wetland restoration, stakeholder engagement and the adoption 
of preferable land use management practices. We will invest in a 
number of water conservation programs in the coming year, as 
well as furthering our partnerships with organizations focused 
on community access and WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) 
solutions, based on local needs. More details on our water footprint is 
available in our ESG Supplement.
In FY22, we will submit our first CDP Water response, with plans to 
increase our disclosures in this area in the future.

Waste in our Operations 
Across our distribution centers, offices and stores, we work to 
minimize waste and avoid sending materials to incineration or landfill, 
including excess inventory.
In FY21, we reduced our overall operational waste compared 
with FY20, due in part to COVID-19-related business impacts. 
We generated approximately 4,600 metric tons of waste at our 
distribution centers and diverted 85 percent of this from landfill—
on track to meet our 2023 goal. In our North America-owned 
distribution centers, we achieved a 90 percent diversion rate in FY21. 
We also collected detailed waste data for all three of our third-party-
operated distribution centers in Asia.  
As we work to become a more circular business, we are integrating 
zero-waste principles across our operations and supply chain. We aim to 
reduce excess inventory, keep materials in use for as long as possible and 
minimize waste generated at our facilities. 
Waste Management

DISTRIBUTION CENTERS
At our distribution centers, we focus on finding recycling solutions 
for the waste materials we generate. In FY21, we worked with local 
recycling vendors to divert over 18,000 pounds of hangers from 
landfill at our North Carolina distribution center. We also began 
using recyclable corn board pallets for our internal distribution 
center activities and aim to expand this in FY22. We diverted all 
creative props and other decorative assets from landfill through 
recycling, sales to staff and donation of over 400 items to Habitat for 
Humanity, universities and other charities.
OFFICES, SUPPLIERS AND STORES 
We initiated several new practices in FY21 to reduce and recycle 
waste from samples and fabric scrap in our offices and with suppliers. 
We are reducing the number of samples being created and shipped 
by working with suppliers to test their materials in-house rather 
than sending samples to third parties. We are also increasing the 
use of digitization so suppliers can create new products virtually 
and reducing sampling components, color approvals and related 
transportation. We also started a partnership with FABSCRAP to 
recycle fabric trim and samples in our offices. In FY21, we recycled 
and reused over 20,000 pounds of fabric waste. To further our 
teams’ knowledge of fabric waste, in FY21 our employee sustainability 
group, the Green Ponies, hosted a discussion with the CEO of 
FABSCRAP during our Earth Day Speaker Series event. 
The Green Ponies also continued to play an active role in other office 
waste reduction efforts. In FY21, they developed and distributed 
office and home recycling guides for our New York employees. They 
also improved the recycling signage in preparation for employees’ 
return to our New York and North Carolina offices.
1Using the Zero Waste International Alliance definition of zero waste, we will divert more than 90 percent 
of the waste generated at our distribution centers from landfill and incineration.

PREVENTING EXCESS AT SOURCE
Our first step to reducing inventory waste is to prevent the 
production of excess product. Minimizing overproduction is a 
challenge across our industry. A key part of the solution is predicting 
product demand so we produce only what is needed. We are working 
toward this by shortening product lead times and implementing agile 
production models. We are also applying intelligent buying techniques 
that more closely predict demand and match it with manufacturing.
We completed a pilot project to minimize overproduction of wholesale 
orders in our European market. The pilot used a “cut-to-sales” model 
to ensure wholesale orders occur only after confirmation of customer 
orders. We will continue to refine our sales models and investigate 
options for improved real-time tracking systems in the European 
market to further avoid excess production.
PURSUE EXPANDED SALES CHANNELS 
Once we have offered our products at full price across our range 
of channels and regions, we consider alternative sales channels for 
products not sold within planned timeframes—including via our outlet 
stores and various clearance partners around the world. Moving units 
between markets can also be an effective way of opening up new sales 
options for existing products. In FY21, we transferred 800,000 units 
globally to put them through clearance channels. 
We are seeing greater interest from our customers in service-
based models such as rental platforms or “shared closets.” In 
FY21, we announced the introduction of The Lauren Look, our first 
subscription apparel rental initiative, with the Lauren Ralph Lauren 
brand. In addition to supporting the reduction of clothing waste 
by expanding the lifespan of garments that might otherwise be 
purchased and worn only a few times, the collections will be donated 
to Delivering Good once they reach their rental cap. In addition to our 
branded rental site, our Polo, Lauren and Club Monaco brands are 
available for rent on multi-branded marketplaces, including Rent the 
Runway, Gwynnie Bee and Nuuly.
MAXIMIZE PRODUCT OR MATERIAL’S 		
NEXT LIFE 
Through capsule-driven collections on the Polo app, in-store events 
and consumer research, we have gained valuable insight into how to 
give our products additional lives through rental, re-commerce and 
upcycling. We are building on the momentum of our current initiatives 
to make a greater impact, focusing on evaluating potential new 
partners to scale our offering. In addition to our subscription apparel 
rental initiative, we see opportunity for a large-scale re-commerce 
program inclusive of restored, reimagined or upcycled products to 
further extend garment lifespans.
EMPLOYEE ACCESS
We give our employees access to excess inventories through stock 
sales. To reduce geographic restrictions to specific stock, we piloted a 
digital employee sale in North America in FY21.
DONATE FOR POSITIVE IMPACT
Our product donation strategy aims to help communities around the 
world, especially where our employees and customers live and work. 
In FY21, we donated more than 1.5 million units of products to 
support hundreds of thousands of frontline workers and families 
in need around the world. The donation included comfortable 
loungewear and daily items, such as sweatshirts, sweatpants and 
T-shirts. These products have been distributed through charity 
networks, as well as many of our long-standing Pink Pony partners 
focused on cancer care.
RECYCLE 
Recycling products at scale presents technical challenges, particularly 
for apparel with blended fabrics and non-textile products like 
footwear and handbags. We are finding more opportunities to recycle 
excess product by exploring new partnerships and innovations.
In FY21, we established partnerships with recyclers in Europe that will 
continue in FY22. We also initiated upcycling pilot projects in North 
America and Asia to explore technologies for converting damaged and 
excess products into new textile fabric and yarns.
DISPOSAL
Once all other options have been exhausted, our last resort is product 
disposal or destruction. We try to avoid this wherever we can, and 
then prioritize waste-to-energy disposal methods where available. We 
continue to ramp up our donation and recycling partnerships to avoid 
the need for disposal. Ultimately, we aim to cease this option altogether.

Environmentally responsible packaging is an essential part of a 
circular future. By 2025, all our packaging material will be recyclable, 
reusable or sustainably sourced, which includes packaging made from 
post-consumer or post-industrial recycled content, or that is Forest 
Stewardship Council (FSC) certified. 
In FY21, 54 percent of our packaging volume and 71 percent of our 
stock-keeping units (SKUs) met at least one of our sustainable 
packaging criteria.5 In FY22, we will be implementing a regular, 
standardized reporting process for our suppliers to allow us to track 
sustainable aspects of our packaging across brands, packaging types 
and regions throughout the year. 
Our Forest Protection Policy supports our 2025 goal, describing our 
commitment to responsibly source any fabric, pulp and paper used 
in packaging. We collaborate with Canopy’s Pack4Good initiative, in 
which innovative companies and suppliers help develop closed-loop 
solutions for packaging and paper that reduce negative environmental 
and social impacts. As part of this initiative, over the next three years 
we will:
•	 Source or design reusable or refillable shipping boxes to reduce 
corrugated paper use.
•	 Design and implement e-commerce, shipping, display and wrapping 
systems that minimize the use of paper.
•	 Employ reusable packaging systems. For example, in FY21, we 
tested reusable packaging from RePack with around 2,000 
e-commerce orders in the U.S. We are evaluating options for 
expanding our use of this packaging in the U.S. and potentially 
other regions.
Sustainable Packaging
100 percent of our packaging material will be recyclable,3 
reusable or sustainably sourced4
2025 GOAL
In FY21, we updated our product packaging inventory, which tracks 
every material used and identifies priority materials for reduction or 
replacement. Our 10 highest-priority materials include high-volume 
usage items, such as decorative tags and polybags.
We currently use FSC certified paper for our hangtags for core items. 
In FY21, we began eliminating nonessential decorative tags, which will 
continue into FY22. 
We plan to transition to 100 percent post-consumer recycled content 
in our plastic polybags in FY22. This is an interim milestone as we 
work to reduce the need for polybags and to identify alternative 
materials for our polybags that fully meet our definition of recyclable 
and sustainably sourced packaging.3,4 We are engaging with partners 
and innovators through the Fashion Pact’s Oceans pillar to identify 
and test paper-based polybag alternatives that will meet our 
performance requirements while also being recyclable at scale.
Through RalphLauren.com, our reduced packaging option gives 
customers the ability to have plastic or paper inserts, hangers, 
garment bags, promotional materials and paper invoices removed 
from their orders. In FY21, we removed and recycled all of the 
polybags from reduced packaging orders, which represented 15 
percent of all orders placed through RalphLauren.com (12 percent in 
FY20). 
3We use the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment definition of 
recyclable: a packaging or packaging component is recyclable if its successful post-consumer collection, 
sorting and recycling is proven to work in practice and at scale.
4Sustainably sourced includes packaging that is post-consumer or post-industrial recycled content or 
FSC certified.
5These percentages represent packaging from the subset of our suppliers who reported data for FY21. 
We are working to collect data from a more complete share of suppliers in FY22 and beyond.

•	 Celebration and Recognition — Appreciate our unique differences 
and increase educational events for all employees, with a focus on 
diverse experiences
Our D&I efforts focus on strengthening diversity and inclusion across 
race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disabilities, 
mental health and wellness.
Diversity & Inclusion 
We unite and inspire the communities 
within our Company as well as those 
we serve by amplifying voices and 
perspectives to create a culture of 
belonging, equality, inclusion and 
fairness for all.

We are always looking to listen, learn and deepen our work to create 
environments that reflect the values that define our brand—values like 
authenticity, dignity and respect for one another. And we want everyone 
to experience these values consistently. We are deeply examining bias—
including looking critically at the structures and practices inside our 
Company, how we use our voice as a leader in our industry and the role we 
play in portraying the American dream.
COMPANY 
ELEVATE TALENT INTO LEADERSHIP RANKS
For every open role at the Vice President level or above, we will interview 
at least one Black candidate and at least one candidate from other 
underrepresented groups. We also committed to ensuring that our Global 
Leadership Team is at least 10 percent Black, African or African American 
and at least 20 percent people of color by 2023.
COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EQUITY
Our retail and distribution and fulfillment center populations are the most 
racially and ethnically diverse areas of our Company. In FY21, we rolled out 
expanded medical benefits for our U.S. part-time employee population. 
Looking ahead, we will regularly review all internal policies to ensure equity 
for our Black, African and African American employees and employees of 
color.
AMPLIFY DIVERSE VOICES AND PERSPECTIVES
We expanded both our D&I Employee Advisory Groups and RL 
Communities, including establishing the Asian, Asian American and 
Pacific Islander (API) Advisory Council; the Black Advisory Council (BAC); 
the Hispanic, Latino and Latinx Advisory Council; the Native American 
Advisory Council in North America; and the Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic 
(BAME) group in EMEA. Each group plays a central role in helping to ensure 
that our Company’s progress is rooted in the real experiences of our 
diverse employees. We also established monthly employee roundtables to 
encourage education and empathy, further build community and empower 
our teams to mobilize action for meaningful impact. In addition, to 
understand the unique needs and priorities of our employees, we increased 
the focus on diversity, equity and inclusion in our employee surveys.
STRENGTHEN STRUCTURED EDUCATION PRACTICES
We have built on the formal unconscious bias and microaggression training 
we started in 2018. Part two of our mandatory D&I training—Respect 
and Inclusion: Allyship and Advocacy—was completed by all managers in 
July 2020 and our entire employee population in December 2020. Going 
forward, completion of this training is required for all new hires.
COMMUNITY 
EXAMINE HOW WE PORTRAY THE AMERICAN DREAM AND USE 
OUR BRAND VOICE
With our Advisory Councils and Employee Groups, we are closely 
reexamining our brand’s role in portraying the American dream—from 
the products we create to the imagery we promote. We’re diversifying 
our brand storytelling, committing to represent Black talent in at least 
20 percent of our brand marketing and advertising on owned digital 
channels each year.
FORGING NEW CREATIVE PARTNERSHIPS
We will be investing in Black, African and African American creative 
partners—including the content creators in front of and behind the 
camera and Black-owned media platforms.
HOLD OUR NETWORK ACCOUNTABLE
In July 2020, we reviewed our media partners to ensure the platforms 
we conduct business through operate in a way that aligns to our 
values and D&I standards. We also developed a set of diversity 
expectations for all partners.
CONNECT WITH CONSUMERS
We are conducting detailed analyses of our Black, African and African 
American consumer composition and their perceptions and expectations 
of our brand to inform our cross-functional business strategies.
SOCIETY 
ADVANCE SOCIAL JUSTICE
We designated four CEO Action for Racial Equity fellows—delegates 
from our Company who are temporarily stepping away from their roles 
to create large-scale impact for racial equity and justice by advancing 
public policy reform at the U.S. local, state and federal levels. In the 
areas around our largest American facilities—New Jersey, New York 
and North Carolina—we started opening dialogues with public works 
bureaus, nonprofits, district attorney offices, school districts, and police 
and sheriff departments. Those conversations turned into opportunities 
for sharing our diversity, equity, inclusion and anti-racism trainings and 
resources. Additionally, through our involvement in the Open To All 
campaign, we are open-sourcing our D&I training materials to public 
safety agencies, schools and businesses.
DEEPEN OUR PARTNERSHIPS AND INVEST IN EDUCATION
We have deepened our relationships with existing partners like The 
Access Project, Phi Beta Sigma and United Negro College Fund. 
Additionally, we donated more than $100,000 in scholarships to 
support students of color and we are developing mentorship and talent 
pipelines with HBCUs and historically Black sororities and fraternities.
We are also exploring ways to increase our support for Asian, Asian 
American and Pacific Islander communities, including but not limited 
to our existing relationship with Asian Americans for Equality, Asian & 
Pacific Islander American Scholars as well as the Asian University for 
Women in Bangladesh.
We recognize that our work is far from being complete, and we 
approach all of this with intentionality and humility. We are on a 
journey and do not claim to have the perfect playbook or all of the 
right answers. But we will continue to accelerate our pace of progress, 
and we will take action today, tomorrow and into a better future. Our 
ongoing commitment to racial equity, including our standing pledge
to be Open to All, can be found in our June 2020 and May 2021 open
letters from Ralph Lauren and Patrice Louvet.

ENSURING DIVERSE REPRESENTATION
The diversity of Ralph Lauren employees and our culture of 
inclusivity drive innovation and creativity. We design our talent 
management programs to attract, retain and promote people from 
all backgrounds. We are committed to being transparent in our D&I 
journey. As part of this commitment, in FY21, we expanded our D&I 
data disclosures to include gender and ethnicity breakdowns by 
corporate and non-corporate roles and the diversity of our Board of 
Directors.
In FY21, 64 percent of our global workforce was female and 60 
percent of our U.S. workforce was from underrepresented race and 
ethnic groups, consistent with representation from FY20.
As a founding member of Parity.org, we support its mission to close 
the gender and racial gap at the highest levels of business, where 
those disparities are widest. Over the past three years, we have 
also worked closely with Parity.org to create our own road map by 
adopting the Parity Model™. Based on representation, equality and 
inclusion, this model will continue to drive gender parity and greater 
diversity within our Company and industry.
In FY21, we continued to meet our goal for gender parity in VP level 
and above positions. Moving forward, we will expand our focus beyond 
parity to include factors that retain women in leadership, including 
flexibility in work, policies, pay equity, culture and development.
We set a new goal in FY21 to have at least 20 percent of our Global 
Leadership Team be from underrepresented race and ethnic groups 
by 2023. We phased our path to this goal, and in FY21, we achieved 
our interim target of 13 percent. 
To make progress toward this goal, we have:
•	 Participated in McKinsey & Company’s Black Executive Leadership 
Program, which is designed for Black senior executives looking to 
ascend to C-suite roles. 
•	 Joined McKinsey & Company’s Management Accelerator Program, 
which provides self-identified Black colleagues an on-demand digital 
curriculum focused on building core management and leadership 
capabilities, as well as cross-functional knowledge. 
Have at least 20 percent of our Global Leadership Team 
be from underrepresented race and ethnic groups
Achieve gender parity with equal representation in 
leadership positions at the VP level and above
ONGOING GOAL
ACHIEVED FOR FY21
2023 GOAL
We also promote gender equality beyond our walls. Within our 
supply chain, our goal is to achieve 25 percent higher female 
representation in factory management by 2025. Learn more in 
Worker Empowerment and Well-Being.
RECRUITING DIVERSE TALENT
To sustain a robust and diverse talent pipeline, our University Relations 
program recruits at broadly representative colleges and career fairs. 
We have committed to interviewing at least two underrepresented 
prospects for each eligible position we have available. In FY21, 58 
percent of our global new hires were female, a decrease of 1 percent 
compared with FY20. Sixty-four percent of U.S. new hires identified 
with one or more underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, a year-
over-year decrease of 4 percent compared to FY20.
We work with nonprofits to expand career opportunities for 
people from marginalized or underserved communities. In FY21, we 
continued our partnership with SEO Scholars to mentor public high 
school and college students for a career in the fashion industry.

FOSTERING AN INCLUSIVE CULTURE
Our Company is home to people from many different backgrounds 
and we value the varied perspectives they bring. We are creating 
a culture in which all employees feel welcome and can thrive 
through the celebration of identities, training and by encouraging 
participation in employee resource groups.
In FY21, we created a new course for all employees, “Respect and 
Inclusion: Allyship and Advocacy.” The course is also part of our 
onboarding for all new employees. 
PAY EQUITY
We take a proactive approach to gender and ethnic pay equity and 
continually monitor our compensation programs to ensure fairness. 
As of FY20, our female employees in the U.S. earned an average of 99 
cents for every $1 earned by males.
In line with Parity.org’s best practices, we conduct a biennial 
assessment with an independent human capital management firm 
to analyze employee compensation based on gender and ethnicity 
in the U.S. In FY20, we found that 96 percent of our U.S. employees’ 
salaries fell within the equal pay parameters set by our model. We 
moved immediately to correct instances where compensation fell 
outside the parameters.2 In FY22, we will expand our human capital 
assessment to examine gender pay equity for our global operations. 
In 2020, we published a U.K. Gender Pay Gap report in line with U.K. 
legislation. Our mean and median gender gaps in pay and bonuses 
were substantially narrower than U.K. average figures. Due to 
COVID-19, the U.K. government did not require companies to publish 
a report for FY21. Our previous reports are available here, and we will 
continue to comply with future reporting requirements. 
In FY21, our workplace culture earned recognition in:
•	 Forbe’s America’s Best Employers for Women  
•	 Forbe’s World’s Best Employers
•	 Great Place to Work’s Certified Companies (U.S.)
•	 Parity.org’s Best Companies for Women to Advance
•	 The Human Rights Campaign’s Best Place to Work for 
LGBTQ Equality
EMPLOYEE RESOURCE GROUPS (ERGs) 
In FY21, we restructured our ERG model to promote global 
participation and inclusion.
The ERGs are grouped in three categories:
•	 D&I Teams: Formed by location in each country and empower 
employees to foster D&I in their local workplaces. 
•	 Ralph Lauren Communities: Focused on a shared area of identity 
and passion and partner with our D&I Teams on advocacy across 
the Company. Communities include Gender Parity; #RL Pride; 
Disability, Mental Health & Wellness; and Working Parents. 
•	 Advisory Groups: Race and ethnicity D&I groups advise our 
Executive Leadership Team and organization to help amplify the 
voices of diverse groups at Ralph Lauren. These groups include: 
Black Advisory Council, Asian Pacific Islander Council, Native 
American Council as well as our Hispanic, Latino and Latinx Council.
2We expect that a small percentage of employees will be paid outside the predicted range to appropriately 
compensate for special skills or advanced degrees, which are not taken into account in the model. In those 
instances, we do not adjust compensation.

INVESTING IN ALL EMPLOYEES
 
EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING 
We attend to the physical, emotional, social and financial needs of our 
employees and their families. THRIVE, our global wellness program, 
provides access to benefits such as flexible work arrangements, 
sabbaticals, volunteer events and physical and mental wellness 
support. In response to COVID-19, we expanded services in the U.S. to 
include additional backup childcare as well as MyStrength, an online 
wellness portal. Globally, we hosted monthly wellness webinars and 
provided weekly meditation through our RL Well-Being Exchange 
program.
LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT
All employees can build skills and prepare for the future through the 
Ralph Lauren Learning Portal. In FY21, 91 percent of employees used 
this platform. We added new courses this year, many of which focus 
on remote working skills as well as D&I. The learning portal is just one 
option for corporate employees to apply their benefit of 10 hours of 
company-sponsored learning time. 
We also support learning beyond our walls through tuition assistance. 
In FY21, Ralph Lauren awarded scholarships to employees enrolled in 
courses that build their professional skills.  
ACTING ON FEEDBACK
We gather direct feedback from employees, measure their 
engagement and, through our employee survey, understand how 
we can improve. Amid the events that occurred over the past year, 
including a transition to remote working, in FY21, we implemented 
three pulse surveys conducted by an independent third party in place 
of our normal annual survey. 
Through the surveys, employees indicated that our top strengths 
include a feeling of connection with our Ralph Lauren values, 
managers’ flexibility and support when addressing personal matters 
and continued pride for the Ralph Lauren brand. The survey 
also highlighted areas of improvement, such as decision-making 
responsibilities for employees in lower-level positions within the 
organization.
For FY22, we will return to our global annual employee survey.
FAIR TREATMENT FOR ALL
Our Fair Treatment Policy helps us maintain a professional and 
productive work environment that is also free from discrimination 
and harassment. In FY21, we updated the policy to include our 
stance against bullying. People can raise concerns about the work 
environment through our open communication policy and they can 
escalate concerns in several ways, including through our open-door 
policy and the RL Global Hotline.
Our Global People Practices Team ensures the Fair Treatment Policy 
is implemented through legal compliance, working practices and 
reviews of impartial issues.
Employees must also adhere to our Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics as well as our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies. We 
provide annual training on these policies to help employees make 
appropriate decisions in their day-to-day work. 
RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS ACROSS OUR 
VALUE CHAIN 
The threat to livelihoods and health posed by COVID-19 reinforces 
the importance of our commitment to respect the human rights of 
everyone touched by our business. 
We embody this commitment in our Human Rights Policy, which 
expresses our decades-long support for the human rights of 
our employees, as well as our suppliers, customers and business 
partners. Our policy was developed with reference to the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Organisation for 
Economic Cooperation and Development Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises.

OUR PEOPLE
At the start of the pandemic, our first priority was to safeguard 
the health and well-being of our people. When the majority of our 
workforce began working remotely, we provided online resources 
to help with this transition, including a focus on physical and mental 
health. For roles that required employees to be in-person, we 
established safety measures within our offices and stores. 
Financial grants were also provided through the Ralph Lauren 
Employee Relief Fund for employees facing financial hardship due to 
unforeseen personal circumstances, such as dealing with significant 
medical expenses, unexpected eldercare or childcare needs and even 
funeral expenses for an immediate family member. As we navigate 
the pandemic, we will continue to evolve our support for our people, 
always with their safety and well-being top of mind.  
“In difficult times like during the country’s shutdown, you 
feel a lot of uncertainty, and you feel like you are alone. With 
financial assistance like this, you feel you have support and 
you have people who care.”
—Halyna, Ralph Lauren Employee Relief Fund grant recipient 
OUR COMMUNITIES
In March 2020, the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation committed 
$10 million to support COVID-19 relief efforts for our employees, 
our partners and our communities. Partner and community support 
included:
•	 Contributing to the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 
Solidarity Response Fund, a global effort to prevent, detect and 
respond to the pandemic.
•	 Supporting the Foundation’s long-standing network of international 
institutions that care for people with cancer, who were especially 
vulnerable during this time.
Our Response to COVID-19
•	 Committing an inaugural gift to the Council of Fashion Designers 
of America and Vogue Fashion Fund to support members of the 
American fashion community affected by the pandemic.
•	 Partnering with the Council of Fashion Designers of America 
Foundation to donate 250,000 masks and 25,000 isolation gowns 
to U.S. frontline workers.
Our Company also committed 1.5 million clothing products, 25,000 
meals and other critical supplie, such as face masks and hand 
sanitizer, to frontline workers and nonprofit organizations around the 
world.
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
Many of the countries where our suppliers are based have been hit 
particularly hard, socially and economically, by the pandemic. We 
worked to uphold the well-being of workers in our supply chain and 
support our suppliers through this challenging time. Our actions 
included:
•	 Conducting nearly 270 virtual Supplier Wellness Checks with 
our suppliers’ facilities from May to August 2020 in order to 
understand the challenges they faced and to identify and assess 
new risks brought on by the pandemic.
•	 Extending collaborations with long-term external partners to help 
us deliver our supply chain empowerment and well-being programs 
and social compliance program. We also changed our assessment 
protocols to reduce burdens on suppliers during this challenging 
time. 
•	 Sharing adoption costs with our suppliers for enrollment in Zero 
Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals and the Sustainable Apparel 
Coalition’s Higg Index Facility Environment Module—upholding the 
importance of continual environmental improvement, even amid 
the challenges posed by COVID-19.
•	 Helping to ensure workers in our supply chain would still be paid by 
honoring our payments for all orders produced or in-production 
and enabling early payment through our supply chain finance 
program.
We remain committed to the safety and well-being of people in our 
Company, communities and supply chain. While the full effect of the 
pandemic has yet to be realized, we know the actions we take each 
day will have a positive impact by supporting and empowering all 
those affected by the pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people, communities 
and businesses globally. Throughout the past year, we 
prioritized keeping our people safe and well, contributing 
to local and international relief efforts and supporting our 
suppliers and their workers in the face of unprecedented 
challenges.

Philanthropy
At Ralph Lauren, philanthropy is core to who we are. We aim to 
support and empower those in our communities through giving back. 
The Ralph Lauren Corporation provides funding, including a portion 
of proceeds from our cause marketing initiatives, to the Ralph Lauren 
Corporate Foundation6 (the Foundation), a distinct charitable entity 
established in 2001. Combined FY21 contributions from the Company 
and the Foundation totaled more than $20 million, up from $7 million 
in FY20.
In March 2020, the Foundation committed $10 million toward 
COVID-19 relief. This funding supported the World Health 
Organization’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, Ralph Lauren 
colleagues dealing with financial challenges and members of the 
American fashion community affected by the pandemic. Learn more 
about the Company’s efforts in Our Response to COVID-19.
SOCIAL JUSTICE
Our commitment to racial equity extends beyond our Company 
to broader society. In summer 2020, the Company donated pre-
purchased advertising space to Black- and African American-led 
partner organizations to help raise awareness of systemic racism. 
We provided billboards in high-traffic areas throughout the U.S. to 
Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Inc., an intercollegiate, historically Black 
fraternity, and the United Negro College Fund (UNCF). We also 
donated a full-page print advertisement in The New York Times for 
UNCF to promote historically Black colleges and universities. 
Community Engagement & 
Philanthropy 
We make a meaningful difference in our 
communities through our global employee 
volunteerism and our dedication to social 
and environmental causes.
CANCER CARE AND PREVENTION
For over 30 years, Ralph Lauren has been committed to raising 
awareness in the fight against cancer. As part of this commitment, 
in 2003, the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care was established 
in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City in partnership with 
the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Cancer Center. Now known 
as the MSK RL Center, its aim remains the same: reduce health 
disparities and improve cancer outcomes by providing high-quality, 
compassionate cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment to all. In 
FY21, the center enhanced its breast cancer prevention and screening 
program and opened an in-center mammography unit. 
Our annual Pink Pony campaign underpins our support for hospitals 
and initiatives that provide cancer care and prevention. Examples of 
this campaign’s worldwide impact in FY21 include:
•	 Supporting ONCOVID, a clinical trial in France that will evaluate 
the impact of COVID-19 on individuals with cancer and how they 
respond to treatment.
•	 Donating to the Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ) 
Cancer Research Center in Germany to support their COVID-19 
research on diagnostic testing and the development of a vaccine 
for high-risk groups, including those with cancer.
•	 Supporting more than 4,000 patients in New York via the MSK 
Financial Assistance Program and the Social Work Patient Fund to 
cover transportation, housing and childcare expenses.
The Company also supports The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity in the 
U.K. We pledged £1 million through FY22 to help establish a research 
area within the Oak Cancer Centre, which will open by the end of 2022. 
“We are proud and honored to have such a special 
and long-standing partnership with Ralph Lauren. 
Your support over the years has made a difference 
for cancer patients and their families at The Royal 
Marsden, across the U.K. and worldwide.” 
—Dame Cally Palmer, Chief Executive, The Royal Marsden

LGBTQIA+ EQUITY AND INCLUSION 
Our Company has proudly supported the LGBTQIA+ community 
for 30 years. In FY21, we launched a Pride campaign that included a 
unisex Polo Pride collection for adults and children. 
FY21 was our second year partnering with the Stonewall Community 
Foundation on our Pride campaign. Stonewall prioritizes and lifts 
up the most vulnerable members of the LGBTQIA+ community, 
including people of color and transgender, gender nonconforming and 
nonbinary people. Through our partnership with Stonewall, we donate 
a portion of the purchase price up to 100 percent of each Polo Pride 
item to LGBTQIA+ organizations around the world. 
ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER 
Worldwide, one in three people do not have access to safe drinking 
water.7 To help end this disparity, we support organizations working 
to provide clean water sources for those in need.  Through our 
continued partnership with GiveMeTap, in FY21, we helped fund 
drinking water projects in rural Africa. We also donate at least $2 
for every Polo-branded bottle sold on RalphLauren.com to help fund 
the installation of water pumps across rural Ghana.8 To date, the 
program has provided 18 water pumps in the Upper West region of 
Ghana and benefited more than 18,000 people.
In FY21, the Foundation expanded its partnership with DigDeep, 
a nonprofit focused on increasing access to water and sanitation 
throughout the U.S. Our three-year collaboration will support the 
COVID-19 emergency water delivery program for Navajo families, 
helping to ensure safe water access for 1,500 households and to 
provide 11 families with in-home water systems in 2022.

Giving Time and Talent
Despite a year of change and uncertainty, our employees’ passion and 
commitment to support their communities remained strong. While 
in-person volunteering was suspended due to COVID-19 restrictions, 
employees found virtual and donation-based opportunities to 
continue giving back.
At the end of FY20, we set a new 2025 target to increase our global 
employee volunteer hours by 25 percent compared to a FY20 
baseline. Although our volunteer hours decreased in FY21 due to 
COVID-19 restrictions, we are confident that we will reach this 2025 
goal through expanded virtual volunteering opportunities and a 
return to in-person volunteering events.    
RALPH LAUREN GIVES BACK
The Ralph Lauren Gives Back program enables our employees to 
volunteer year-round across social and environmental causes, 
including Pink Pony, Earth Day and Season of Giving. In FY21, we dealt 
with the restrictions of COVID-19 by adapting our program to create 
other ways of giving back throughout the year, including introducing 
the Ralph Lauren Matching Gift program.
Through this program, donations of up to $1,000 made to nonprofit 
organizations by employees who have been with the Company for at 
least one year will be matched on a one-to-one basis by the Ralph 
Lauren Corporate Foundation, up to a total of $1 million dollars.
A focus this year was providing support for the frontline workers 
who were tirelessly serving our communities amid COVID-19. In FY21, 
our Ralph’s Coffee truck visited hospitals in New York to provide 
complimentary coffee and food to hospital staff. We also partnered 
with The Conduit, Gail’s Bakery and Rocket Food to provide more 
than 25,000 meals for London’s frontline workers and their families.

VIRTUAL VOLUNTEERISM
COVID-19 changed the way we live and work, including 
how we support our communities. By adapting our Ralph 
Lauren Gives Back volunteer program, we ensured 
employees could stay safe while still helping local 
nonprofit organizations.  
We organized virtual volunteering opportunities 
throughout the year, including Pink Pony in October and 
Season of Giving in December. To encourage remote 
participation, we sent push notifications through our “RL 
Today” mobile app, informing employees about both local 
and global volunteering opportunities. Local volunteer 
captains also shared reminders of upcoming events.
We adopted a virtual format for events such as AIDS 
Walk NYC and Light the Night, which supports the 
Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. This new format allowed 
our employees around the world to participate safely. 
FY21 also marked our first year supporting the UNCF 
Walk to raise funds for educational scholarships.
Until in-person volunteering can resume safely, we will 
continue to find new, remote ways to engage employees 
in giving back.

THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON OUR WORK 
WITH SUPPLIERS
Our Global Citizenship work in the supply chain relies on regular 
and direct contact with our suppliers. However, travel restrictions 
and local lockdowns required us to change our approach to supplier 
assessments and engagement this year. Between May and August 
2020, we contacted all our direct suppliers to conduct virtual factory-
level Supplier Wellness Checks. We used these checks to understand 
our suppliers’ challenges, identify and assess new risks arising from 
the pandemic and share resources to optimize health and safety.  
Online meetings, webinars and calls enabled regular and direct 
dialogue with our suppliers. This enhanced our understanding of risks 
and issue resolution and allowed us to better engage factories as we 
moved back to on-site activity, where local restrictions allowed.
We also extended collaborations with long-term partners to help 
us deliver our programs in FY21—including BSR, Elevate, the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Labour 
Organization (ILO), Impactt Limited and Taos Network. We leveraged 
their local expertise to support our capability-building and training 
efforts in applicable countries.
Worker Empowerment & 
Well-Being
We are committed to conducting our 
global operations ethically and with 
respect for the dignity of all people who 
make our products. We aim to enrich the 
quality of work and life for everyone in our 
supply chain, ensuring they all have the 
opportunity to reach their full potential in 
a safe and inclusive environment.
RISK ASSESSMENT
Our global risk assessment tool helps us identify and evaluate 
our impacts on people and the environment, including those 
associated with our supply chain. We worked with a group of external 
stakeholders to further inform our understanding and prioritization 
of risk. As a result, we extended the internal and public information 
sources feeding into our analysis, with attention to:
•	 Risks associated with production processes with certain raw 
materials or chemical inputs—read more about our approach to 
supplier engagement.
•	 Risks to particularly vulnerable groups of workers, in addition to 
country, regional and other sector risks. 
We elevate the results of our updated risk assessment to the Board 
of Directors for regular review.
Supporting Migrant Workers
We do not tolerate any abuse of workers’ rights in our supply chain. 
This includes the use of coercion, threat or deception that impact a 
person’s ability to refuse or cease work or deprive them of personal 
freedom. 
Foreign migrant workers can be particularly vulnerable to 
exploitation and unfair treatment and our Foreign Migrant Worker 
Standards aim to secure fair employment terms for them.   
In FY20, our Foreign Migrant Worker (FMW) assessment tool 
identified fees paid by workers from Indonesia and Vietnam at one of 
our accessories factories in Taiwan. Their pay slips showed monthly 
deductions for recruitment agency fees. These fees are viewed by 
workers as standard when working overseas and are permitted by 
Taiwanese law, which is part of the remediation challenge. 
Our FMW Standards provide protection for workers above the 
Taiwanese legal requirement and we therefore took action to 
eliminate this practice. The factory has changed its own policy and 
practices and reimbursed these fees, so its workers are not charged. 
The factory covers the cost of the recruitment agent’s monthly fee, 
resident permit, health check, passport and airfare for workers.  
Our audit in FY21 confirmed that the factory continues to comply 
with this standard. We will monitor compliance going forward and 
the factory’s continued relationship with us will be contingent on full 
compliance.

Championing Workers 
We work with supplier factories to enhance the career progression 
and well-being of their workers. We focus on fair compensation and 
wage management, as well as worker empowerment and life skills—
with an emphasis on developing female leadership. In FY21, we added a 
focus on diversity and inclusion (D&I).
The payment of living wages is a salient human rights issue in our 
sector. A living wage is defined as one where a worker receives a 
wage that is sufficient to meet their family’s basic needs, such as 
food, water, clothing, housing, education and healthcare, plus some 
discretionary income for savings and unexpected events. We address 
this high priority issue through our Wage Management Strategy, 
which has executive level and Board oversight. We focus on wage 
management systems at the factory level, as well as the impact of 
our own purchasing practices, in order for suppliers to deliver fair 
compensation to workers in our supply chain.   
In FY21, to increase our understanding of wage levels across our 
supply chain, we developed and deployed a new detailed wage 
data collection tool with our suppliers. We collected data on basic 
wage, overtime wage, allowances, benefits, incentives, bonuses 
and deductions. We have also begun to review our suppliers’ wage 
management systems, including the presence of digital payments and 
policies on pay equity. 
We collected more than 75,000 pieces of data from the majority of 
our strategic and key suppliers across our top 10 sourcing regions. 
We used the data to create wage ladders, plotting basic and total 
take-home wages against local minimum wage, the industrial average 
wage and various living wage benchmarks, such as those from the 
Global Living Wage Coalition and the Asia Floor Wage Alliance. We 
have more work to do, but we were encouraged to find that almost 
half of our strategic and key suppliers are already meeting a living 
wage benchmark for average total take-home pay. As expected, we 
observed regional differences and supplier variation: 
Roll out our Wage Management Strategy to all of our 
strategic and key suppliers to address fair and timely 
compensation for factory workers
2023 GOAL
•	 Some countries, such as China, are achieving the benchmarks for 
total take-home pay, but are doing so through heavy reliance on 
overtime and other bonuses. 
•	 We saw higher wage levels, relative to benchmarks, in Italy and Sri 
Lanka. We have further to go in India and Cambodia and at some of 
our Indonesian and Vietnamese suppliers. 
We also gathered feedback directly from workers in Vietnam to 
understand what level of income they feel would meet their needs 
comfortably, referred to as “aspirational pay.” We will be extending 
this work to other regions next year. 
Insight from this analysis and our engagement with suppliers on this 
topic, even during a pandemic, will enable us to prioritize and develop 
action plans to improve wage management systems and outcomes for 
workers over the coming years.  
We recognize the important role we play in helping to ensure workers 
in our supply chain receive fair and timely compensation through our 
internal Responsible Purchasing Practices guidelines. 
SUPPLIER DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
Championing D&I is central to our values and approach to doing 
business. We extended our D&I efforts in FY21 to more closely 
involve business partners and suppliers. Read more about our overall 
approach to diversity and inclusion. 
We created a D&I workstream with our strategic supplier group to 
raise awareness of key issues and guide them to develop or enhance 
their own strategies. This work takes into account that D&I has many 
different cultural contexts that vary by locale. Through a series of 
quarterly roundtables, the group has so far:
•	 Shared what diversity looks like in their offices, factories, 
communities and countries.
•	 Confirmed a shared ambition to create inclusive workplaces.
•	 Identified specific themes as “diversity dimensions,” including 
gender, age, language and culture. 
•	 Held roundtables in their factories and shared the outcomes with us. 
We will continue this work in FY22, with the focus on the diversity 
dimensions of language and culture.   
In FY21, we partnered with BSR to develop open-source D&I e-learning 
for the supply chain, which will launch in FY22. This training tool will 
raise awareness of D&I issues among supply chain managers and 
supervisors and demonstrate inclusive behaviors. We will tailor the 
training for five geographies to reflect different regional contexts. 
Recognizing that this is a culturally sensitive and often challenging 
topic, we hope our efforts will lead to more inclusive workplaces for 
workers across our supply chain and beyond.

2025 GOAL
WORKER EMPOWERMENT AND LIFE SKILLS
Despite the challenges of COVID-19, we continued our worker 
empowerment and life-skills programs in FY21 using remote or virtual 
engagement. As of FY21, more than 39,000 workers across our supply 
chain received access to our empowerment and life-skills programs.
We are especially committed to empowering the women who work 
in our supply chain to build better lives for themselves and advance 
their careers. On average, 67 percent of the workers at our supplier 
factories are women, which is typical for our sector, and the global 
average of female supervisors in our top sourcing countries was 
47 percent in FY21. The percentage of women holding supervisory 
positions varies by region. For example, in Indonesia and Vietnam, 
women account for 62 and 68 percent of supervisors, respectively. 
In Bangladesh, Peru, Guatemala and India, this figure is 15 percent 
on average.  
Along with helping us identify the countries where we will focus our 
efforts over the coming years, the above figures revealed we have 
fewer women in supervisory roles across our supply chain compared 
with FY20. We will be conducting further analysis to understand the 
root cause, but believe this drop may reflect the pandemic’s well-
reported impact on womens’ professional well-being.
We continue to partner with BSR to sponsor the HERhealth program 
to empower workers through health education. We are receiving 
impact data for factories that have completed the program. Progress 
from beginning the program in March 2019 to completing it in 
February 2021 includes:
•	 There are no incidents of participants reporting missing work due 
solely to menstruation (86 percent at start). 
•	 Participants can now report at least three of the four benefits of 
handwashing (25 percent at the start). 
•	 There has been a 17 percent decrease of women workers reporting 
physical aches and pains from performing their job.
In FY21, we expanded the program to Vietnam. To date, the program 
has reached over 25,000 workers in our supply chain, 16,000 of whom 
are women. 
Other programs to increase female empowerment and leadership in 
our supply chain this year included:
•	 Engaging our strategic supplier group to develop action plans for 
maintaining or increasing female leadership at their facilities. 
•	 Continuing our partnership with the IFC and ILO Gender Equality 
and Returns (GEAR) Program in Bangladesh. GEAR trains female 
workers to prepare them for supervisory roles. It also trains 
factory managers on how to identify, promote and support high-
potential female workers.
•	 Developing a specialized program to bring women’s health 
education to hand-knitters in China. Our local partner Taos 
Network held workshops in the villages where women hand-knit 
sweaters and do not have access to the workplace wellness 
programs of a traditional factory environment.
•	 Sponsoring the expansion of HERessentials to India. The 
HERessentials module leverages digital tools to build workers’ 
adaptive capacity and resilience in the face of crisis. This new 
technology-driven program engages workers and managers on 
gender, health and financial inclusion.
GRIEVANCE MECHANISM TRAINING
It is vital that factory workers have the means to report any issues 
associated with their workplace without fear of retaliation. Last 
year, we launched the RL Grievance Mechanism Program for factory 
workers as a complement to the primary operational-level grievance 
mechanism run by the factories themselves, and we continue to roll 
this out across supplier factories. The program enables workers 
to escalate their concerns directly to us using the RL Hotline email 
address, accessible through a QR code. Information is made available 
to workers on posters throughout the factory in their local languages. 
Our Operating Standards require factories to maintain effective 
grievance mechanisms. We assess these mechanisms against 
the UN Guiding Principle’s effectiveness criteria and also audit 
factories’ grievance logs. Through this process, we reviewed over 
450 grievances across eight countries in FY21. The top categories of 
these included 33 percent related to a health and safety concern at 
the facility or individual workstation, 13 percent related to benefits 
concerns and 12 percent related to factory food services of the 
canteen. At the end of FY21, 98 percent of the grievances were 
reported as resolved, 1 percent were under an appeal process and 
less than 1 percent were under investigation. 
In FY21, we focused on training factory managers and workers on 
effective grievance mechanisms. We worked with local experts and 
partners to deliver the trainings in applicable languages, reaching 102 
factories in eight countries that collectively employ around 180,000 
workers. We will continue educating managers and workers on the 
importance of grievance mechanisms, alongside evaluating and 
improving the effectiveness of our program.

Our Global Citizenship team monitors the compliance of our business 
partners as part of our due diligence processes. Our risk assessment 
processes help us to identify salient risks and prioritize areas for

respect to legal and ethical matters, labor, animal welfare and 
environmental compliance. The standards must be prominently 
displayed in relevant languages in factory areas where workers 
congregate. We regularly review this document in response to

Our approach encourages transparency and continuous

training—and agree on corrective action plans that prioritize 
workers’ welfare and livelihoods.
We use in-house and independent third-party audits alongside 
assessments conducted through the ILO Better Work program. 
In FY21, we extended our audits into tier 2 fabric mills. Our risk 
segmentation system, based on audit results, is part of the supplier 
scoring in our Supplier Engagement program and directly influences 
our sourcing decisions. 
In FY21, all of our active factories received a risk rating. As with FY20, 
most factories (63 percent) were rated as medium risk. We saw a 
1 percent increase in low risk and high risk ratings, and a 1 percent 
decrease in high-medium risk. 
ZERO-TOLERANCE ISSUES
We will stop working with factories that do not rectify instances of:
•	 Pervasive nontransparent record keeping
•	 Not paying minimum wage
•	 Monetary fines
•	 Locked emergency exits
•	 Unauthorized subcontracting
•	 Forced labor/Human trafficking
•	 Child labor
•	 Abuse (physical, verbal)
•	 Harassment (including sexual harassment) and discrimination
•	 Bribery

AUDIT FINDINGS
We audited 63 percent of factories supplying us in FY21, representing 
89 percent of our volume. We conducted 327 audits at tier 1 factories 
and 60 at tier 1 subcontractors. We also conducted 15 audits at tier 
2 fabric mills, representing 30 percent of our top 50 woven and knit 
fabric mill suppliers. Compared to FY20, our total percent of factories 
audited dropped 12 percent due to COVID-19 restrictions. 
The most common categories of nonconformance were health and 
safety (53 percent), wages and benefits (14 percent) and working 
hours (12 percent). After reviewing all nonconformance issues with a 
supplier, we agree on a corrective action plan and follow up to ensure 
issues are addressed in a timely manner.
Less than 2 percent of audit findings revealed zero-tolerance issues 
(40 of 2,738 total findings). We deactivated two suppliers that were 
unable to remediate these issues or other Operating Standards 
requirements.

WORKING WITH LICENSEES
In addition to our own products, we license the Ralph Lauren brands 
to selected companies. All licensees are required to have social 
compliance programs and standards equivalent to our own. We 
separately assess licensee supplier compliance programs and review 
their audits to ensure that they meet our requirements. In FY21, 
26 licensees used approximately 328 factories to make licensed 
products.
The pandemic reinforced the importance of collaborating efficiently 
with our suppliers and peers. We revised our protocols to enable 
sharing and recognition of supplier audits and assessments with 
other companies, which helped reduce the administrative burden on 
suppliers during this challenging time. 
The ILO Better Work program continued its work in various on-site 
and virtual forms during the pandemic, ensuring all the factories 
we source from in the program were engaged through assessment, 
virtual visit or progress check-ins.  
We conducted more than 430 Supplier Wellness Checks in FY21. 
Suppliers shared details on enhanced health and safety measures 
in response to COVID-19, adherence to local wage and benefit 
requirements and communications tools used to stay connected with 
and support their workers.

Supplier Engagement
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy aims 
to achieve mutual, long-term, positive 
impacts across our supply chain. This 
requires enduring partnerships based on 
transparency and trust. 
PARTNERING WITH OUR SUPPLIERS FOR POSITIVE IMPACT
We seek to work with partners who share our values and our 
commitment to conduct business with citizenship, sustainability and 
quality at heart. 
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) guides us in building and 
maintaining these partnerships. It enables us to drive continuous 
improvement and positive impact based on shared transparency, 
accountability and value creation. 
We communicate our expectations of responsible practices, and 
seek feedback on expectations on us as a responsible partner, with 
all suppliers, with a focus on our key and strategic suppliers, who 
represent the majority of our business. Currently, 50 percent of our 
business is with these suppliers, and we are aiming for 80 percent 
by 2025. In FY21, we amended the end date of this goal from 2022 to 
2025 in light of challenges caused by COVID-19. 
OUR APPROACH TO SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT 
Graphic adapted internally from “Five Critical Components of Supplier Relationship Management.” BravoSolution, 8 Feb. 2016.
In FY21, despite restrictions related to COVID-19, our Global Product 
Integrity and Quality Assurance teams continued to: 
•	 Empower suppliers to develop internal labs so they can self-test 
the performance attributes of materials and products instead of 
having these items tested by a third party. 
•	 Train suppliers on our Product Life Cycle Management System and 
provide training and certification for suppliers to self-approve for 
garment fit and construction. These actions enable more efficient 
processes for testing and quality assurance.
Read about how we worked with and supported our suppliers during 
the pandemic in Our Response to COVID-19.
In FY21, we continued to engage strategic and key suppliers and top 
fabric mills through the Sustainable Apparel Coalition’s (SAC) Higg 
Index Facility Environment Module (FEM). We collected data from 230 
tier 1 facilities, representing 77 percent of our supply chain spend—an 
increase from 63 percent last year. Within the reporting facilities, 103 
(50 percent of our business spend) have completed data verification 
by an SAC-approved third party. Facilities scored an average of 46 
points across all sections, with an average of 54 points in the water 
section and 71 in the energy section.   
During the year, we expanded our rollout of Higg Index FEM to 
cover 31 mills, representing approximately 21 percent and 32 
percent of our woven and knit fabric production, respectively. A 
total of 25 mills have completed third-party verification, with an 
average score of 49 points.

Our teams regularly assess supplier capabilities, capacities and 
performance, which in turn supports workers at the factory level. 
Understanding factory capacity helps us avoid placing orders that 
might lead suppliers to subcontract without our authorization or 
to place pressure on workers to put in excessive hours. To avoid 
making requests of our suppliers that could exceed their capacity 
to supply us on time, we plan orders early, keep factory capacity and 
capabilities under review and work to anticipate the need for new 
capabilities.
In FY21, we further integrated citizenship and sustainability into 
our SES and launched our Vendor Management System (VMS), a 
database that enables us to share information and opportunities 
with all tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers. We also integrated citizenship 
and sustainability into our Vendor Score Card, carbon, water and 
chemical management, as well as social and environmental targets 
now sit alongside other business-critical issues, such as quality. 
Where compliance issues are shared across a number of suppliers in a 
particular region, we develop targeted capability-building and training 
events. These programs enable suppliers to share challenges and 
learnings and develop a common understanding of our requirements. 
In FY21, we used webinars and online meetings, including supplier 
summits in India and Turkey, to engage suppliers on key issues.
LINKING SUPPLIER CAPACITY AND 
PERFORMANCE TO PURCHASING DECISIONS
In FY21, we also:
•	 Updated our Responsible Purchasing Practices, with a heightened 
focus on citizenship and sustainability principles. 
•	 Held Strategic Supplier Summits to share our business direction 
and discuss innovation, citizenship and sustainability, as well as a 
roundtable conversation on diversity and inclusion. We also kept 
suppliers updated during the pandemic via regular online meetings.
•	 Partnered with the Better Buying Initiative to seek anonymous 
feedback from suppliers on what it’s like to work with us so we 
can understand how our processes and practices impact their 
factories and workers. In FY22, we will develop action plans based 
on the survey results.
•	 Were rated in the CDP’s top 7 percent of companies for supplier 
engagement on climate change.
We will extend our SES from finished goods suppliers to material 
suppliers in the coming years. As we embrace the opportunities 
brought by increased digitization and innovation across our industry, 
we will also work with suppliers to take new technologies to scale and 
develop new business models built on circular principles.

natural gas, diesel, propane, gas oil, heavy fuel oil and electricity.
Total fuel consumption within the organization from renewable sources: 44,238 GJ of electricity.
Electricity consumption: 709,809 GJ 
Heating consumption: 227,081 GJ 
Cooling consumption: 0 GJ 
Steam consumption: 0 GJ
Total energy consumption within the organization: 936,890 GJ
Standards, methodologies, assumptions, calculation tools and conversion factors used: 
World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Energy consumption calculated 
for energy from natural gas, diesel, propane, gas oil and heavy fuel oil consumed at global 
owned and operated retail stores, offices and distribution centers. Site-specific energy use 
is determined using a three-tiered system, depending on the availability of primary data 
for the fiscal year. If we have primary data for all months that a facility was operating in 
the fiscal year, the energy usage data is simply summed. If we have partial primary data, 
a regression is attempted based on typical yearly weather data to fill gaps. Finally, if the 
regression fails or we have no primary data, we model yearly energy using facility square 
footage and an energy use intensity based on the climate zone and facility type.
More details on our footprint can be found in the Carbon & Energy section on page 18 of our 
2021 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report.

Reduction of energy consumption
Energy consumption reduced as a direct result of conservation and efficiency initiatives: 
4,628 MWh 
Types of energy included: Electricity used in owned and operated global retail stores 
Base year: Fiscal year 2020 (April 1, 2019-March 31, 2020) 
Standards, methodologies, assumptions and calculation tools used: Calculated based on 
average annual store electricity savings from LED lighting retrofits. Assuming half of annual 
electricity savings realized in FY21 for 37 retrofitted stores in North America. Additional 
information for this indicator is available in 302-1. 
More details on our energy efficiency initiatives can be found in the Carbon & Energy section

Water consumption
In FY21, we continued to collaborate with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to advance our 
work in this area and set a comprehensive strategy for water stewardship and water 
use reductions in our value chain. Our goal to reduce water use by at least 20 percent by 
2025 relates to manufacturing and processing in our supply chain and water use in our 
owned and operated facilities, compared to an FY20 baseline of 14,870,315 m3. In FY21, our 
footprint was 9,661,765 m3. We considered two factors in our water risk analysis, the basin 
risk – associated with the geography of our business and supply chain; and the operational 
risk – resulting from water use in manufacturing activities. The combination of both aspects 
forms a basis to our contextual water target, which aligns our reduction goal with the 
surrounding water challenges. More details on our water footprint is available in the Water 
Stewardship section on page 21 of our 2021 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report. 
In our manufacturing supply chain, we focus on improving water use efficiency while also 
considering the shared basin-level water needs where our suppliers’ fabric mills, factories 
and laundries are located. In priority water-stressed locations, we are contributing to 
collective action projects with WWF and local partnerships and experts to scale water 
use assessments and reduction strategies. We are also working with our manufacturers to 
use more water-efficient production methods and to capture water data through the 
Sustainable Apparel Coalition Higg Index Facility Environment Module. The five tier 2 fabric 
mills we enrolled in the Apparel Impact Institute Mill/Impact program are progressing 
through an 18-month process to reduce their overall environmental impact, including water 
use. The most recent focus is on efficiency measures, including optimizing the recovery 
of steam condensate and cooling water, maximizing the reuse of manufacturing process 
water and advancing wastewater treatment systems. Preliminary results show 8 to 20 
percent reductions in water use, with the investment payback period ranging from 5 to 26 
months. In parallel, we are continuing our partnership with knit and woven manufacturers 
to minimize water use and improve effluent treatment by upgrading factory processing and 
equipment. We also continue to reduce the use of water-intensive chemicals and processing 
in the production of our core denim products. 
As part of our water stewardship strategy, we evaluated the impacts of cotton farming. We 
looked at our key cotton growing regions through the WWF Water Risk Filter to identify 
geographies with high risk for water scarcity. We also estimated total water use (rainfed 
and irrigated) in cotton agriculture—the volume used is significant, and our focus is on both 
reducing water use in cotton production and increasing effectiveness of water use. A key 
driver of this is the adoption of regenerative farming practices that make better use of 
rainfall and irrigated land. These practices increase soil fertility, water holding capacity and 
carbon capture; reduce erosion and pollution runoff; and create more resilience against 
floods and droughts. 
In FY22, we will submit our first CDP Water Response, with plans to increase our 
disclosures in this area in the future.
Standards, methodologies, assumptions and calculation tools used: Our supply chain water 
footprint was calculated based on the amount of water withdrawn from various water 
sources, combined with data from supplier manufacturing facilities and other activity data. 
The water footprint for our global owned and operated retail stores, offices and 
distribution centers were calculated using site-specific water use. If we do not have the 
site’s primary data, we model yearly water use through facility square footage and water 
use intensity based on the region and facility type.

We explicitly state in our Vendor Compliance and Operating Standards that all suppliers 
are required to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations of the regions where they 
operate, including, but not limited to, the local environmental standards. We have the 
right to terminate our business relationship should the supplier fail to comply with the 
applicable laws and regulations. In addition to that, we are screening our supply base 
for any potential significant environmental impacts through the Higg Index Facility 
Environmental Module and the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) 
Supervision platform (the latter is specific to China-based facilities). If an issue is found, 
we require the supplier to take corrective action and put in place preventive measures 
to avoid recurrence. Specifically, on any violation record found on the IPE platform, 
we also require the facilities—at a minimum—to publish enterprise feedback onto the 
platform, which details the corrective and preventive measures taken.
In FY21, we screened all our tier 1 facilities and our top mills through these platforms. 
We identified nine facilities with potential significant environmental impacts related to 
industrial wastewater, permits and air emissions. We do not use Higg FEM assessment 
results or IPE records to terminate business relationships with suppliers. We addressed

CG-AA-250a.1                                            
Ralph Lauren has Vendor Compliance Packets (VCP) for all mills and finished-goods suppliers. The 
VCP states suppliers must comply with American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA) Restricted 
Substances List (RSL). We adopt the AAFA RSL to serve as a practical tool that sets forth specific 
chemical substance bans, limitations or test methods, as specified by government or regulatory 
agencies.  
 
We test to the strictest global standard. Tests are performed through our Apparel Testing Program, 
which ensures our products meet compliance requirements, regardless of their markets of distribution. 
It also contains protocols on how tests should be conducted, including all fabrics, trims or related 
materials, apparel, accessories, footwear, home textiles and components that are supplied or sold 
to the Company for use in the manufacturing or distribution of any Ralph Lauren product. A zero 
tolerance policy is in effect on any product not meeting the RLC standards as defined in the protocol. 
Suppliers are required to use only Ralph Lauren nominated independent third-party testing labs to 
achieve passing test reports for raw materials and finished products prior to the shipping of product. 
  
We also use independent third-party labs to conduct raw material risk assessments of our lines each 
year to ensure our raw material suppliers are clear with our development standards and deliver fabric 
that will meet our compliance requirements. The raw material risk assessment result will reset fabric 
testing and garment testing standards if needed. As such, fabric testing cannot begin until an approved 
raw material risk assessment exists.  
 
Our three stages of testing are: 
1. Fabric testing for apparel 
The testing is required for bulk yardage in all colorways and where approved raw material risk 
assessment exists. A completed and passing fabric test is valid for six months. 
  
2. Component testing for apparel, footwear and accessories 
Suppliers are allowed to test the raw material and subcomponents used to produce an item. 
A completed and passing subcomponent test is valid for 12 months. 
 
3. Finished-goods testing for home, apparel and footwear 
Finished goods testing must be done in bulk fabric with bulk trim items. A completed and passing 
finished goods test is valid for six months.

Discussion of processes to 
assess and manage risks 
and/or hazards associated 
with chemicals in products                                        
CG-AA-250a.2                                      
Our process for assessing and managing risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products 
is described above. Policies and practices are fully aligned across our brands and product categories. 
As described above, all raw materials and finished products undergo testing to confirm compliance 
with regulations. Depending on the volume of orders, some styles may undergo more testing than 
others. We take a combination of hazard- and risk-based approaches to chemical management. 
As mentioned above, we complete extensive risk assessments each year by raw material. We are 
fully compliant with all laws and regulations and are currently exploring innovations for reduction, 
elimination or assessment outside of that scope. The third-party certifications used and our 
approach to chemical management at each stage of the product life cycle are discussed above. 
 
We partner with the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) to work towards the alignment 
and collective action across the industry in monitoring and eliminating the usage and discharge 
of hazardous chemicals in textile, apparel and leather manufacturing, as well as promoting the 
development and adoption of safer chemical alternatives. We aim to eliminate the use of hazardous 
chemicals in our supply chain by 2025. We fully adopt the ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted 
Substances List (MRSL) and have communicated expectations to our supply chain through our 
Sustainable Chemicals Management Policy, as well as our VCP.  
 
In FY21, we gained visibility of chemical usage and MRSL conformance status of strategic and 
key facilities and top mills, representing approximately 31 percent of our supply chain spend. The 
suppliers are expected to adopt the ZDHC-approved chemical inventory list (CIL) management tool 
through either BHive, BVE3 or CleanChain and provide us with direct visibility to the chemicals 
used in our production through the tool. Each supplier’s chemical inventory is screened against 
the ZDHC MRSL through the tool to monitor conformance and drive the adoption of safer 
chemical alternatives. At the end of FY21, 59 percent of chemicals reported from the suppliers 
as mentioned above conform with the ZDHC MRSL. We are working closely with our supplier to 
achieve full conformance by 2025. The suppliers with wet processing facilities are also expected 
to test wastewater against ZDHC wastewater guidelines and share on the ZDHC Gateway portal. 
Seventy-two percent of the facilities that tested comply with the ZDHC requirement, and out of the 
substances screened, 99.8 percent comply with the ZDHC standard. 
 
We also assessed our suppliers’ chemical management, along with other environmental impact data, 
through the Sustainable Apparel Coalition Higg Index Facility Environmental Module (FEM). In FY22, 
the results of the FEM assessment, verified by a third party (vFEM) and combined with the supplier’s 
conformance to the ZDHC MRSL and the wastewater standards, will be incorporated into our 
supplier evaluation scorecard and will help inform business decisions. 
 
In conjunction with these collaborative efforts, we developed a chemical phaseout program internally 
as an initiative to proactively eliminate the use of the priority chemicals in current and future 
design and production. In FY21, we launched our internal framework to phase out the use of per- 
and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) for our products with water repellent functionality, with 
a target for complete elimination by FY22. The chemicals applied as surface coating on our water 
repellent fabric need to be certified as PFC-free. In addition to ZDHC ChemCheck report, suppliers 
are also required to provide Oeko-Tex EcoPassport or Bluesign-approved chemical certification to 
demonstrate its compliance.  
 
We continued our transition to sustainable denim production across our global facilities. In FY21, 
our Men’s and Women’s Polo denim transitioned away from the use of potassium permanganate (PP) 
spray in our core washes, with the aim of complete elimination by the end of FY22.  
 
In FY21, we announced our Circularity Strategy. We are partnering with McDonough Innovation to 
obtain Cradle to Cradle (C2C) certification—a globally recognized measure of safer, more sustainable 
products that are designed for circularity. Our strategy is focused on three pillars that will allow us 
to expand our approach to timelessness. Those pillars are: Design for Circularity, Create Circular 
Consumer Experiences and Advance a Circular Product Economy. Through our partnership with 
McDonough Innovation, we will make five iconic products C2C Certified™ by 2025. The C2C Certified™ 
products will be assessed through each phase of manufacturing, from the raw materials selection, 
chemicals usage and processing, to all the way to the finished goods.

In FY21, 99.5 percent of tier 1 direct supplier facilities were in compliance with wastewater discharge 
permits and/or contractual agreements.    
We explicitly state in our Vendor Compliance and Operating Standards that all suppliers are required to 
adhere to all applicable laws and regulations of the regions where they operate, included, but not limited 
to, the local environmental standards. We have the right to terminate our business relationship should 
the supplier fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations. Our compliance audit also includes 
the compliance to wastewater regulations as part of the health and safety requirement.  
 
Our main supply chain risks associated with the wastewater discharge are related to the usage of 
chemicals in production and the effluent treatment system put in place.  
 
Our supplier facilities implement effluent treatment methods in accordance with the local regulatory 
requirements. This may include operating an on-site effluent treatment plant (ETP), partnering with an 
off-site ETP and, for some, implementing a zero liquid discharge effluent treatment system.  
 
In addition to the regulatory compliance, we adopt the ZDHC MRSL and its suite of tools to guide 
and align our efforts to eliminate the use and discharge of hazardous chemicals with the industry’s 
standards and best practices. This includes the implementation of ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines, which 
goes beyond the regulatory compliance. The ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines provide clear guidance 
in effluent testing methods, parameters, limits and reporting approach as a way to confirm that our 
manufacturing facility is not discharging hazardous chemicals to the environment. In FY21, we rolled out 
the ZDHC wastewater test to our strategic and key suppliers, as well as our top raw material suppliers, 
as part of our sustainable chemicals management initiative to monitor the facilities’ conformance 
against the ZDHC MRSL. While the wastewater test is only a snapshot of the effluent quality of the 
facility, it ensures an annual monitoring that allows us to follow up and address any nonconformance 
from its source through a root cause analysis approach that aligns with the ZDHC. This helps inform 
both the facility and Ralph Lauren on targeted chemicals phaseout at the facility level.

independent third-party audits, together with audits conducted by our in-house team and assessments 
from Better Work. In FY21, 63 percent of our tier 1 direct supplier factories were audited, and 97

work with Better Work, an international organization focused on improving working conditions in the 
garment industry, to conduct audits in some of our factories.

We identify priority (key) raw materials based on three criteria: top volume materials, such as cotton, 
materials with high environmental and social risks and impacts, such as cashmere, and materials of high 
importance to the Ralph Lauren brand, such as down. The scope of our risk assessment includes apparel 
and other Ralph Lauren products, including home goods, footwear and accessories. We identified seven 
key raw materials: cotton, polyester, leather, cashmere, wool, down and viscose.  
 
The environmental risks associated with these raw materials include water scarcity and stress, climate 
change, soil health, chemical management and animal welfare. The primary social risks include unsafe 
workplace conditions, exposure to toxic chemicals and unfair pay.  
 
To manage our risk associated with priority raw materials, we set a 2025 goal for 100 percent of our 
key materials to be sustainably sourced. We also set a goal for 100 percent of our animal-derived 
materials—as covered by our Animal Welfare Policy—to be certified or traceable. We define sustainably 
sourced with specific standards and certifications for each key raw material.
In partnership with the World Wildlife Fund, we conducted a global water risk assessment across the 
Ralph Lauren value chain, including the risk associated with cotton growing. Our key cotton growing 
regions, including India and China, are vulnerable to water scarcity and stress. To reduce these risks, 
we are continuing to support cotton grown according to the Better Cotton Initiative, whose mission is 
to address the environmental, social and economic issues associated with growing cotton. In FY21, we 
sourced 9,000 metric tons of cotton lint sourced as Better Cotton. By 2025, 100 percent of our cotton 
will be sustainably sourced.  
 
Utilizing recycled cotton and polyester fibers is another way we are mitigating raw material risks 
to reduce carbon emissions, energy and natural resources needed to produce virgin materials. We 
leverage trusted third-party standards, such as the Responsible Wool and Down Standards. We are also 
researching recycled alternatives to reduce our use of virgin material. Our raw materials assessment 
and goals are disclosed in the Sustainable Materials section on page 11 of our 2021 Global Citizenship & 
Sustainability Report.
Percentage of raw materials 
third-party certified to an 
environmental and/or social 
sustainability standard, by standard  
CG-AA-440a.2 
33 percent of units produced in FY21 were made with raw materials that met a third-party certification. 
31.5 percent of units met the criteria for the Better Cotton Initiative, while 1.8 percent of units were 
made with material certified to chain-of-custody standards, including the Global Organic Textile 
Standard and the Organic Content Standard for cotton, and the Global Recycle Standard and Recycled 
Claim Standard for cotton, polyester, nylon and wool.
Activity Metric
Number of (1) tier 1 suppliers 
and (2) suppliers beyond tier 1                          
CG-AA-000.A                                      
At the end of FY21, we had 489 active factories. This number primarily represents our tier 1 
suppliers, with select suppliers beyond tier 1.
