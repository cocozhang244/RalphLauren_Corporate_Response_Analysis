PART I
Item 1.
Business.
General
Founded in 1967 by Mr. Ralph Lauren, we are a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including
apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, fragrances and hospitality. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed
across an expanding number of products, brands, sales channels, and international markets. We believe that our global reach, breadth of product offerings,
and multi-channel distribution are unique among luxury and apparel companies.
We diversify our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and
licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or
channel of distribution. We sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-
shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-
party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which we have licensed the right to operate in defined geographic
territories using our trademarks. In addition, we license to third parties for specified periods the right to access our various trademarks in connection with
the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.
We organize our business into the following three reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to these reportable segments,
we also have other non-reportable segments. See "Our Segments" for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.
Our global reach is extensive, as we sell directly to customers throughout the world via our 530 retail stores and 654 concession-based shop-within-
shops, as well as through our own digital commerce sites and those of various third-party digital partners. Merchandise is also available through our
wholesale distribution channels at over 11,000 doors worldwide, the majority in specialty stores, as well as through the digital commerce sites of many of
our wholesale customers. In addition to our directly-operated stores and shops, our international licensing partners operate 80 Ralph Lauren stores, 31
Ralph Lauren concession shops, and 139 Club Monaco stores and shops.

[PAGE 5 OF 401]
================================================================================
We continue to invest in our business to stimulate growth. Over the past five fiscal years, we have invested approximately $1.331 billion for capital
improvements, primarily funded through strong operating cash flow. We also have continued to return value to our shareholders through our common stock
share repurchases and payment of quarterly cash dividends. Over the past five fiscal years, the cost of shares of Class A common stock repurchased
pursuant to our common stock repurchase program was approximately $1.800 billion and dividends paid amounted to approximately $892 million.
We have been controlled by the Lauren family since the founding of our Company. As of March 28, 2020, Mr. R. Lauren, or entities controlled by
the Lauren family, held approximately 84% of the voting power of the Company's outstanding common stock.
Objectives and Opportunities
We believe that our size and the global scope of our operations provide us with design, sourcing, and distribution synergies across our different
businesses. Our core strengths include a portfolio of global premium lifestyle brands, a well-diversified global multi-channel distribution network, an
investment philosophy supported by a strong balance sheet, and an experienced management team. Despite the various risks and uncertainties associated
with the current global economic environment, as discussed further in Item 7 — "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations — Global Economic Conditions and Industry Trends," we believe our core strengths will allow us to execute our long-term growth
strategy.
An overview of our long-term growth strategy is presented below:

Global Citizenship and Sustainability
Global citizenship and sustainability at Ralph Lauren Corporation is rooted in the heritage of our brand and our purpose to inspire the dream of a
better life through authenticity and timeless style. We believe that delivering the next 50 years for Ralph Lauren means rethinking our impact on the
environment and society and utilizing creativity, the power of design, and innovative technologies to drive meaningful change.
Although we are at the beginning of this journey, the values and purpose that have defined our business for half a century underline the authenticity
of our commitment for our next 50 years. We call our plan "Design the Change," which is guided by the following three pillars:
1.
Create Timeless Style
•
Sustainable Product Design — We commit to designing more sustainable products and experiences by sourcing responsibly, manufacturing
efficiently, and investing in innovation that advances these efforts.
•
Sourcing & Traceability — We are committed to sourcing responsibly, securing a long-term, sustainable supply for key raw materials, as well
as implementing a supplier engagement strategy that drives transparency, efficiency and partnerships that advance our work to deliver positive
social and environmental impacts across our value chain.
•
Chemical Management — We commit to monitor and reduce hazardous chemical use and discharge, ultimately eliminating all hazardous
chemicals from the production of our products.
2.
Protect the Environment
•
Carbon and Energy — We commit to address the issue of global climate change and the contributing impacts of our business by reducing
greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain.
•
Waste Management — We commit to integrating zero waste principles across our business with an aim to divert waste from landfill through
increasing recycling and upcycling, reducing waste at its source, and implementing other best practices.
•
Water Stewardship — We commit to reducing water consumption across our value chain, and to safeguarding and preserving water resources
in the communities where we operate.
3.
Champion Better Lives
•
Diversity and Inclusion — We are committed to advancing an inclusive environment where everyone has a sense of belonging throughout our
value chain.
•
Health, Safety & Working Conditions — We aim to enrich the quality of work and life for all workers in our value chain by ensuring that
everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential in a safe and comfortable work environment.
•
Community Engagement & Philanthropy — We commit to meaningfully engaging our communities through our work across cancer care as
well as our global employee volunteerism program.
Additional information relating to Design the Change can be found in our annual sustainability report, which is available at our website at
http://investor.ralphlauren.com under the caption "Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report." The content of our sustainability reports are not
incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.

Recent Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic
A novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe in recent months, including throughout all
major geographies in which we operate (North America, Europe, and Asia), resulting in adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well as
significant volatility in global financial markets. Governments worldwide have imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as
temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such factors, among others, have
resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. Additionally, during this period of uncertainty,
companies across a wide array of industries have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating expenses and preserve cash balances, including work
furloughs and reduced pay, which could lower consumers’ disposable income levels or willingness to purchase discretionary items. Further, even after such
government restrictions and company initiatives are lifted, consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences, such as their willingness to
congregate in shopping centers or other populated locations, could be adversely affected.
In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of our stores,
distribution centers, and corporate facilities, as have our wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors. For example, a significant number
of our stores in parts of Asia were closed for a substantial portion of our fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020. Although our stores in Asia were largely reopened
by the end of our Fiscal 2020, certain countries, including Japan, began imposing new restrictions during our first quarter of Fiscal 2021. Retail traffic also
continues to be challenging in those regions in which our stores are open. Additionally, our stores in North America and the majority in Europe closed mid-
March or earlier, and although certain stores have since reopened, a large number remain closed and we are uncertain when they will reopen. Our wholesale
business has also been adversely affected, particularly in North America and Europe, as a result of department store closures and lower traffic and
consumer demand.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken preemptive actions to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity, including:
•
drawing down $475 million from our Global Credit Facility to bolster cash balances;
•
entering into a new credit facility with the same lenders that are parties to the Global Credit Facility, which provides for an additional $500 million
senior unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on May 25, 2021, or earlier in the event we are able to obtain other additional financing, as
described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements;
•
temporarily suspending our common stock repurchase program and our quarterly cash dividend;
•
temporarily reducing the base compensation of our executives and senior management team, as well as our Board of Directors;
•
carefully managing our expense structure across all key areas of spend, including aligning inventory levels with anticipated demand and
postponing non-critical capital build-out and other investments and activities; and
•
temporarily furloughing or reducing work hours for a significant portion of our employees who nevertheless remain eligible for employee benefits
during such period.
The COVID-19 pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve on a daily basis. Accordingly, we cannot predict for how long and to what
extent this crisis will impact our business operations or the global economy as a whole. We will continue to assess our operations location-by-location,
taking into account the guidance of local governments and global health organizations to determine when our operations can begin returning to normal
course of business. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse
effect on our business" for additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Swiss Tax Reform
In May 2019, a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (the "Swiss Tax Act"),
which became effective January 1, 2020. The Swiss Tax Act eliminates certain preferential tax items at both the federal and cantonal levels for
multinational companies and provides the cantons with parameters for establishing local tax rates and regulations. The Swiss Tax Act also provides
transitional provisions, one of which allows eligible companies to
6
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 8 OF 401]
================================================================================
increase the tax basis of certain assets based on the value generated by their business in previous years, and to amortize such adjustment as a tax deduction
over a transitional period. In connection with this transitional provision, we recorded a one-time income tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset of
$122.9 million during Fiscal 2020, which decreased our effective tax rate by 3,760 basis points.
See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the Swiss Tax Act.
Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan
On June 4, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan associated with our strategic objective of operating with discipline to drive
sustainable growth (the "Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan"). The Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan includes the following restructuring-related activities: (i)
rightsizing and consolidation of our global distribution network and corporate offices; (ii) targeted severance-related actions; and (iii) closure of certain of
our stores and shop-within-shops. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan are expected to result in gross annualized expense savings of
approximately $60 million to $80 million.
In connection with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan, we have recorded cumulative charges of $145.8 million since its inception, of which $48.5
million and $97.3 million were recorded during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan are
complete and no additional charges are expected to be incurred in connection with this plan.
See Note 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal
2019 Restructuring Plan.

Our Segments
We organize our business into the following three reportable segments:
•
North America — Our North America segment, representing approximately 51% of our Fiscal 2020 net revenues, primarily consists of sales
of our Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through our retail and wholesale
businesses in the U.S. and Canada, excluding Club Monaco. In North America, our retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren
stores, our factory stores, and our digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.com. Our wholesale business in North America is comprised
primarily of sales to department stores, and to a lesser extent, specialty stores.
•
Europe — Our Europe segment, representing approximately 26% of our Fiscal 2020 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph
Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in
Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America, excluding Club Monaco. In Europe, our retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph
Lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites. Our wholesale business in
Europe is comprised of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various
third-party digital partners.
•
Asia — Our Asia segment, representing approximately 17% of our Fiscal 2020 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren
branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Asia,
Australia, and New Zealand. Our retail business in Asia is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-
based shop-within-shops, and our digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.cn, which launched in September 2018. In addition, we sell our
products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. In Asia, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to
department stores, with related products distributed through shop-within-shops.
No operating segments were aggregated to form our reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable
segments, representing approximately 6% of our Fiscal 2020 net revenues, which primarily consist of (i) sales of Club Monaco branded products made
through our retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and our licensing alliances in Europe and Asia, and (ii) royalty revenues
earned through our global licensing alliances, excluding Club Monaco.
This segment structure is consistent with how we establish our overall business strategy, allocate resources, and assess performance of our Company.
Effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, operating results related to our business in Latin America are included within our Europe
segment due to a change in how we manage this business. Previously, such results were included within our other non-reportable segments. All prior period
segment information has been recast to reflect this change on a comparative basis.
Approximately 46% of our Fiscal 2020 net revenues were earned outside of the U.S. See Note 20 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for a summary of net revenues and operating income by segment, as well as net revenues and long-lived assets by geographic location.
Our Retail Business
Our retail business sells directly to customers throughout the world via our 530 retail stores and 654 concession-based shop-within-shops, totaling
approximately 4.1 million and 0.7 million square feet, respectively, as well as through our own digital commerce sites and those of various third-party
digital partners. We operate our business using a global omni-channel retailing strategy that seeks to deliver an integrated shopping experience with a
consistent message of our brands and products to our customers, regardless of whether they are shopping for our products in physical stores or online.
Ralph Lauren Stores
Our Ralph Lauren stores feature a broad range of apparel, footwear, accessories, watch and jewelry, fragrance, and home product assortments in an
atmosphere reflecting the distinctive attitude and image of the Ralph Lauren, Polo, and Double RL brands, including exclusive merchandise that is not sold
in department stores. During Fiscal 2020, we opened 23 new Ralph Lauren

licensing partners, and our other retail stores and digital commerce operations, and also serve as a secondary distribution channel for our excess and out-of-
season products.
Concession-based Shop-within-Shops
The terms of trade for shop-within-shops are largely conducted on a concession basis, whereby inventory continues to be owned by us (not the
department store) until ultimate sale to the end consumer. The salespeople involved in the sales transactions are generally our employees and not those of
the department store.

Directly-Operated Digital Commerce Websites
In addition to our stores, our retail business sells products online in North America and Europe through our various directly-operated digital
commerce sites, which include www.RalphLauren.com and www.ClubMonaco.com, among others, as well as through our Polo mobile app in North
America and the United Kingdom. In Asia, we sell products online through our directly-operated digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.cn, which
launched in September 2018, as well as through various third-party digital partner commerce sites.
Our Ralph Lauren digital commerce sites offer our customers access to a broad array of Ralph Lauren, Polo, and Double RL apparel, footwear,
accessories, watch and jewelry, fragrance, and home product assortments, and reinforce the luxury image of our brands. While investing in digital
commerce operations remains a primary focus, it is an extension of our investment in the integrated omni-channel strategy used to operate our overall retail
business, in which our digital commerce operations are interdependent with our physical stores.
Our Club Monaco digital commerce sites offer our domestic and Canadian customers access to our global assortment of Club Monaco apparel,
footwear, and accessories product lines, as well as select online exclusives.
Our Wholesale Business
Our wholesale business sells our products globally to leading upscale and certain mid-tier department stores, specialty stores, and golf and pro shops,
as well as to various third-party digital partners. We have continued to focus on elevating our brand by improving in-store product assortment and
presentation, as well as full-price sell-throughs to consumers. As of the end of Fiscal 2020, our wholesale products were sold through over 11,000 doors
worldwide, with the majority in specialty stores. Our products are also increasingly being sold through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale
customers.
The primary product offerings sold through our wholesale channels of distribution include apparel, footwear, accessories, and home furnishings. Our
luxury brands, including Ralph Lauren Collection and Ralph Lauren Purple Label, are distributed worldwide through a limited number of premier fashion
retailers. In North America, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, and to a lesser extent, specialty stores. In Europe,
our wholesale business is comprised of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various
third-party digital partners. In Asia, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, with related products distributed through
shop-within-shops. We also distribute our wholesale products to certain licensed stores operated by our partners in Latin America, Asia, Europe, and the
Middle East.
We sell the majority of our excess and out-of-season products through secondary distribution channels worldwide, including our retail factory stores.

We have three key wholesale customers that generate significant sales volume. During Fiscal 2020, sales to our three largest wholesale customers
accounted for approximately 18% of our total net revenues. Substantially all sales to our three largest wholesale customers related to our North America
segment.
Our products are sold primarily by our own sales forces. Our wholesale business maintains its primary showrooms in New York City. In addition, we
maintain regional showrooms in London, Madrid, Milan, Munich, Paris, and Stockholm.
Shop-within-Shops.    As a critical element of our distribution to department stores, we and our licensing partners utilize shop-within-shops to
enhance brand recognition, to permit more complete merchandising of our lines by the department stores, and to differentiate the presentation of our
products.

The size of our shop-within-shops ranges from approximately 85 to 9,200 square feet. Shop-within-shop fixed assets primarily include items such as
customized freestanding fixtures, wall cases and components, decorative items, and flooring. We normally share in the cost of building out these shop-
within-shops with our wholesale customers.
Replenishment Program.    Core products such as knit shirts, chino pants, oxford cloth shirts, select accessories, and home products can be ordered
by our wholesale customers at any time through our replenishment program. We generally ship these products within two to five days of order receipt.
Our Licensing Business
Through licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight, design, and marketing skills with the specific product or geographic competencies of
our licensing partners to create and build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners who are leaders in their respective markets, contribute
the majority of product development costs, provide the operational infrastructure required to support the business, and own the inventory. Our licensing
business has been aggregated with other non-reportable segments.
Product Licensing
We grant our product licensees the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated
products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings. Each product licensing partner pays us royalties based upon its sales of our
products, generally subject to a minimum royalty requirement for the right to use our trademarks and design services. In addition, our licensing partners
may be required to allocate a portion of their revenues to advertising our products and sharing in the creative costs associated with these products. Larger
allocations typically are required in connection with launches of new products or in new territories. Our license agreements generally have two to five-year
terms and may grant the licensees conditional renewal options.

================================================================================
[PAGE 15 OF 401]
================================================================================
We work closely with all of our licensing partners to ensure that their products are developed, marketed, and distributed to reach the intended
consumer and are presented consistently across product categories to convey the distinctive identity and lifestyle associated with our brands. Virtually all
aspects of the design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising, and promotion of Ralph Lauren products are subject to our
prior approval and continuing oversight. We perform a broader range of services for most of our Ralph Lauren Home licensing partners than we do for our
other licensing partners, including design, operating showrooms, marketing, and advertising.
The following table lists our largest licensing agreements as of March 28, 2020 for the product categories presented. Except as noted in the table,

International Licensing
Our international licensing partners acquire the right to sell, promote, market, and/or distribute various categories of our products in a given
geographic area and source products from us, our product licensing partners, and independent sources. International licensees' rights may include the right
to own and operate retail stores. As of March 28, 2020, our international licensing partners operated 80 Ralph Lauren stores, 31 Ralph Lauren concession
shops, and 139 Club Monaco stores and shops.
Digital Ecosystem
Investing in our digital ecosystem remains a primary focus and is a key component of our integrated global omni-channel strategy that spans across
owned and partnered channels, both physical and digital. Our digital ecosystem is comprised of directly-operated platforms, wholesale partner websites,
third-party digital pure players, and social commerce.
Our directly-operated digital commerce sites represent our digital flagships, displaying the most elevated expression of our brands. The strategy for
our digital flagships is to deliver distinct and immersive brand experiences, continuously enhance consumer experience, and develop digital content that
drives deeper consumer engagement and conversion. With the ongoing launch of our localized sites, including in Ireland and Switzerland this year, we
continue to expand the reach of our digital flagship experience. In connection with our long-term growth strategy, we are also working to broaden our
omni-channel service offerings, such as buy online and pickup and return in store. In addition to our directly-operated digital commerce sites, we have also
recently launched our Polo mobile app in the United Kingdom, our first mobile app launch outside of North America.
Our products are also sold through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers across the globe. With all partners in our
ecosystem, we seek to showcase the brand consistently with our values. We collaborate with our key wholesale customers to deliver the right content to the
right audience, and leverage consumer insights to develop a holistic, channel-agnostic view of our consumer.
We also sell our products online through various third-party digital pure-play sites to reach younger consumers and amplify our brand messages. On
many of these sites, we have created digital shop-in-shop environments with a consistent brand experience, tailored product stories, and an assortment that
is carefully curated by our merchants. We also partner closely with our pure-play
14
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 16 OF 401]
================================================================================
customers on marketing content and events, as well as optimizing search and other data analyses to drive higher traffic and conversion for our brands. We
also continue to tap into the social commerce opportunity, such as our launch of Instagram shopping in Europe this year.
In connection with our digital commerce operations, we engage consumers through various digital and social media platforms, which are supported
through our collaboration with influencers who have an authentic connection to our brand.
Seasonality of Business
Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale
sales in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping
periods impacting our retail business and timing of seasonal wholesale shipments. As a result of changes in our business, consumer spending patterns, and
the macroeconomic environment, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of our future performance.
In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating income, and cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as
changes in weather patterns.
Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital requirements typically increase during the first half of the fiscal year as
inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling periods and, accordingly, typically decrease during the second half of the fiscal year as inventory is
shipped/sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the second half of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements
during that period.
Product Design
Our products reflect a timeless and innovative interpretation of American style with a strong international appeal. Our consistent emphasis on new
and distinctive design has been an important contributor to the prominence, strength, and reputation of the Ralph Lauren brands.
Our Ralph Lauren products are designed by, and under the direction of, Mr. Ralph Lauren and our design staff. We form design teams around our
brands and product categories to develop concepts, themes, and products for each brand and category. Through close collaboration with merchandising,
sales, and production staff, these teams support all of our businesses in order to gain market information and other valuable input.
Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing and advertising programs communicate the themes and images of our brands and are integral to the success of our product offerings.
The majority of our advertising program is created and executed by our in-house creative and advertising agency to ensure consistency of presentation,
which is complemented by our marketing experts in each region who help to execute our international strategies.
We create distinctive image advertising for our brands, conveying the particular message of each one within the context of the overall Ralph Lauren
aesthetic. Advertisements generally portray a lifestyle rather than a specific item and include a variety of products offered by us and, in some cases, our
licensing partners. Our communication campaigns are increasingly being executed through digital and social media platforms to drive further engagement
with the younger consumer, with a focus on influencers. With regard to influencers, we believe in fostering long-term relationships with those who have an
authentic connection to our brand and influence the areas of culture that matter most to our audiences. We also continue to advertise through print and
outdoor media, and, to a lesser extent, through television and cinema.
Our digital advertising programs focus on high impact and innovative digital media outlets, which allow us to convey our key brand messages and
lifestyle positioning. We also develop digital editorial initiatives that allow for deeper education and engagement around the Ralph Lauren lifestyle,
including the RL Magazine, RL Style Guide, and a wide array of video and social media content. We deploy these marketing and advertising initiatives
through online, mobile, video, email, and social media. Our digital commerce sites present the Ralph Lauren lifestyle online, while offering a broad array
of our apparel, footwear, accessories, and home product lines.
15
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 17 OF 401]
================================================================================
Additionally, we advertise in consumer and trade publications, and participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with some of our
retail and licensing partners. We have outdoor advertising placements in key cities as well, focusing on impact and reach. We also provide point-of-sale
fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation of our products at their retail locations. In addition, when our licensing partners
are required to spend an amount equal to a percentage of their licensed product sales on advertising, in certain cases we coordinate the advertising
placement on their behalf. We believe our investments in shop-within-shop environments and retail stores, including our global flagship locations,
contribute to and enhance the themes of our brands to consumers.
We also conduct a variety of public relations activities. For example, we typically introduce each of the spring and fall menswear and womenswear
collections at press presentations in major cities such as New York City and Milan. Such fashion events, in addition to celebrity red carpet dressing
moments and events hosted in our stores and restaurants, including The Polo Bar in New York City, generate extensive domestic and international media
and social coverage.
We continue to be the official outfitter for all on-court officials at both the Wimbledon and the U.S. Open tennis tournaments. Both tournaments
provide worldwide exposure for our brand in a relevant lifestyle environment. We also continue to be the exclusive Official Parade Outfitter for the U.S.
Olympic and Paralympic Teams, with the right to manufacture, distribute, advertise, promote, and sell products in the U.S. which replicate the Parade
Outfits and associated leisure wear. Most recently, we dressed Team U.S.A. for the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, and will
be dressing the team for the next Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. As part of our involvement with Team U.S.A., we have established a
partnership with athletes serving as brand ambassadors and as the faces of our advertising, marketing, and public relations campaigns. We are also the
official apparel outfitter for the Professional Golfers' Association ("PGA") of America, the PGA Championship, and the U.S. Ryder Cup Team, as well as a
partner of the American Junior Golf Association. We sponsor a roster of professional golfers, including Billy Horschel, Davis Love III, Doc Redman, Justin
Thomas, Nick Watney, and Tom Watson.
We believe our partnerships with such prestigious global athletic events reinforce our brand's sporting heritage in a truly authentic way and serve to
connect our Company and brands to our consumers through their individual areas of passion.
Sourcing, Production and Quality
We contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own or operate any production facilities. Over 500 different manufacturers worldwide
produce our apparel, footwear, accessories, and home products, with no one manufacturer providing more than 4% of our total production during Fiscal
2020. We source both finished products and raw materials. Raw materials include fabric, buttons, and other trim. Finished products consist of manufactured
and fully assembled products ready for shipment to our customers. In Fiscal 2020, approximately 98% of our products (by dollar value) were produced
outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, with approximately 25% of our products sourced from China. See "Import Restrictions
and Other Government Regulations," Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Economic conditions could have a negative impact on our major customers, suppliers,
vendors, and lenders, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business," and Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Our business is subject to risks
associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications."
Most of our businesses must commit to the manufacturing of our garments before we sell finished goods, whether to wholly-owned retail stores or to
wholesale customers. We also must commit to the purchase of fabric from mills well in advance of our sales. If we overestimate our primary customers'
demand for a particular product or the need for a particular fabric or yarn, we primarily sell the excess products or garments made from such fabric or yarn
in our factory stores or through other secondary distribution channels.
Suppliers operate under the close supervision of our global manufacturing division and buying agents headquartered in Asia, the Americas, the
Middle East, and Europe. All products are produced according to our specifications and standards. Production and quality control staff in Asia, the
Americas, the Middle East, and Europe monitor manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the final product.
Procedures have been implemented under our vendor certification and compliance programs so that quality assurance is reviewed early in the production
process, allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.

Competition
Competition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with numerous
designers and manufacturers of apparel, footwear, accessories, fragrances, and home furnishing products, both domestic and international. We also face
increasing competition from companies selling our product categories through the Internet. Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have
substantially greater resources than us. We compete primarily on the basis of fashion, quality, value, and service, which depend on our ability to:
•
anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and shopping preferences, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement,
social media communications, and online shopping;
•
create and maintain favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and reputation for quality;
•
develop and produce innovative, high-quality products that appeal to consumers of varying age groups;
•
competitively price our products and create an acceptable value proposition for consumers;
•
provide strong and effective marketing support;
•
obtain additional points of distribution and sufficient retail floor space, and effectively present our products to consumers;
•
attract consumer traffic to stores, shop-within-shops, and websites;
•
source raw materials at cost-effective prices;
•
anticipate and maintain proper inventory levels;
•
ensure product availability and optimize supply chain and distribution efficiencies;
•
maintain and grow market share;
•
recruit and retain key employees; and
•
protect our intellectual property.
See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — We face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate."

All facilities are designed to allow for high-density cube storage and value-added services, and utilize unit and carton tracking technology to
facilitate process control and inventory management. The distribution network is managed through globally integrated information technology systems.
Information Systems
Our information systems facilitate business processes, consumer experiences, and decision-making support across the Company and our extended
ecosystem of manufacturers, vendors, business partners, and customers. Our system applications are connected to support the flow of information across
functions, including:
•
product design, sourcing, and production;
•
comprehensive order processing, fulfillment, and distribution;
•
retail store and digital commerce operations;
•
marketing and advertising;
•
financial accounting and management reporting; and
•
human resources.
Our retail operation systems, including point-of-sale registers and merchandising, planning, and inventory management systems, support operational
processes within our store network and link with our digital commerce processes to support omni-channel capabilities.
We are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems and software. During Fiscal 2020, we migrated our Asia operations to a new
financial reporting information technology system, Microsoft AX Dynamics 365. In addition to this system implementation, during Fiscal 2020, we began
reconfiguring the financial reporting information technology system used by our Europe operations, SAP, in order to utilize enhanced financial reporting
functionality. We are also continually enhancing the consumer experience by adding new functionality on our digital commerce sites.
We have a longstanding information security risk program committed to regular risk management practices surrounding the protection of
confidential data. This program includes various technical controls, including security monitoring, data leakage protection, network segmentation and
access controls around the computer resources that house confidential or sensitive data. We have also implemented employee awareness training programs
around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. We continually evaluate the security environment surrounding the handling and control of our critical
data, especially the private data we receive from our customers, employees and partners, and have instituted additional measures to help protect us from
system intrusion or data breaches. Additionally, we have purchased network security and cyber liability insurance in order to provide a level of financial
protection, should a data breach occur.
See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or
employees, expose us to litigation risk, and adversely affect our business" and "Risk Factors — Our business could suffer if our computer systems and
websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively."
Wholesale Credit Control
We manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital
partners, and extend credit based on an evaluation of the wholesale customer's financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. We
monitor credit levels and the financial condition of our wholesale customers on a continuing basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor or underwrite
our accounts receivables, nor do we maintain credit insurance to manage the risk of bad debts. In North America, collection and deduction transactional
activities are provided through a third-party service provider. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a
limited number of large wholesale customers. Our business could be adversely affected as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings, other
ownership changes in the retail industry, and/or any financial instability of our large wholesale customers."

Wholesale Backlog
We generally receive wholesale orders approximately three to five months prior to the time the products are delivered to customers, with the
exception of orders received through our replenishment program, which ship within two to five days of order receipt. Our wholesale orders are generally
subject to broad cancellation rights.
The following table presents our wholesale backlog by segment as of March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019:

Approximately 45% of our wholesale backlog was subsequently canceled during the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 driven by adverse impacts
associated with COVID-19 business disruptions, which include temporary department and specialty store closures worldwide, as well as declines in retail
traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. The COVID-19 pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve on a daily basis.
Accordingly, we cannot predict at this time how much of our remaining wholesale backlog will be fulfilled within the next 12 months.
The size of our order backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the timing of the market weeks for our particular lines during which a
significant percentage of our orders are received and the timing of shipments, which varies from year-to-year with consideration for holidays, consumer
trends, concept plans, and the replenishment program's usage. As a consequence, a comparison of the size of our order backlog from period-to-period may
not be meaningful, nor may it be indicative of eventual shipments.
Trademarks
We own the RALPH LAUREN, POLO, POLO BY RALPH LAUREN DESIGN, and the famous polo player astride a horse trademarks in the
U.S. and approximately 120 countries worldwide. Other trademarks that we own include:
•
PURPLE LABEL;
•
DOUBLE RL;
•

•
LAUREN RALPH LAUREN;
•
PINK PONY;
•

•
Various other trademarks, including those pertaining to fragrances and cosmetics.
Mr. Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as trademarks RALPH LAUREN, DOUBLE RL, and RRL in perpetuity in connection with,
among other things, beef and living animals. The trademarks DOUBLE RL and RRL are currently used by the Double RL Company, an entity wholly
owned by Mr. R. Lauren. In addition, Mr. R. Lauren has the right to engage in personal projects involving film or theatrical productions (not including or
relating to our business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a company wholly owned by Mr. R. Lauren. Any activity by these companies has no impact on us.

[PAGE 21 OF 401]
================================================================================
Our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items of apparel, apparel-
related products, home furnishings, restaurant and café services, online services and online publications, and beauty products, as well as in connection with
retail services, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable
as long as the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. We regard the license to
use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and, on a worldwide
basis, vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. As a result of the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been the object of counterfeiting.
While we have a broad enforcement program which has been generally effective in protecting our intellectual property rights and limiting the sale of
counterfeit products in the U.S. and in most major markets abroad, we face greater challenges with respect to enforcing our rights against trademark
infringement in certain parts of Asia.
In markets outside of the U.S., our rights to some or all of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our international
expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks, including POLO and/or a
representation of a Polo Player Design, which impede our use and registration of our principal trademarks. While such conflicts are common and may arise
again from time to time as we continue our international expansion, we have, in general, successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both legal
action and negotiated settlements with third-party owners of the conflicting marks (see Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Our trademarks and other intellectual
property rights may not be adequately protected outside the U.S." and Item 3 — "Legal Proceedings" for further discussion). Although we have not
suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not
arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce trademarks to new markets.
Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations
Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand is subject to duties. In addition, most of the
countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas and duties to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market
disruption. The U.S. and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported (from China or
other countries) at unfairly traded prices in such increased quantities that would cause (or threaten) injury to the relevant domestic industry (generally
known as "anti-dumping" actions). If dumping is suspected in the U.S., the U.S. government may self-initiate a dumping case on behalf of the U.S. textile
industry which could significantly affect our costs. Furthermore, additional duties, generally known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the
U.S. government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures
or threatens to injure a U.S. industry.
In addition, each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. Because the U.S. and the other countries
in which our products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, or
adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of import restrictions and opportunities. We seek to
minimize our potential exposure to import-related risks through, among other measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts of production
among countries and manufacturers, and through geographical diversification of our sources of supply.
As almost all of our products are manufactured by foreign suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international
trade regulations or executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in sourcing patterns could adversely affect our operations. See
Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks" and
"Risk Factors — Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and
to our specifications."
We are also subject to other international trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, now known as the U.S.-Mexico-
Canada Agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-
Korea Free Trade Agreement and other special trade preference programs. A portion of our imported products are eligible for certain of these duty-
advantaged programs.
Apparel and other products sold by us are under the jurisdiction of multiple governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade
Commission, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. Our products are
also subject to regulation in the U.S. and other countries, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which relate principally to
product labeling, licensing requirements, and consumer product safety requirements and regulatory testing, particularly with respect to products used by
children. Any failure to comply with such requirements could result in significant penalties and require us to recall products, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business or operating results. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these regulations, as well as
20
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 22 OF 401]
================================================================================
applicable federal, state, local, and foreign rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. We do not anticipate
any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the next fiscal year or in the near future. Our licensed products, licensing
partners, buying/sourcing agents, and the vendors and factories with which we contract for the manufacture and distribution of our products are also subject
to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, vendors, and factories to operate in compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or
operating results.
We are also subject to disclosure and reporting requirements, established under existing or new federal or state laws, such as the requirements to
identify the origin and existence of certain "conflict minerals" under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and disclosures of
specific actions to eradicate abusive labor practices in our supply chain under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. While we require our
suppliers to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and our operating guidelines which promote ethical and socially responsible business practices,
any violation of labor, environmental, health, and safety or other laws, or any divergence by an independent supplier's labor practices from generally
accepted industry standards, could damage our reputation, disrupt our sourcing capabilities, and increase the cost of doing business, adversely affecting our
results of operations. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Our business could suffer if we fail to comply with labor laws or if one of our manufacturers fails to
use acceptable labor or environmental practices."
Although we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant
impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets.
Employees
As of March 28, 2020, we had approximately 24,900 employees, comprised of approximately 13,700 full-time and approximately 11,200 part-time
employees. Approximately 13,800 of our employees are located in the U.S. and approximately 11,100 are located in foreign countries. Approximately 15 of
our U.S. production employees in the womenswear business are members of Workers United (which was previously known as UNITE HERE) under an
industry association collective bargaining agreement, which our womenswear subsidiary has adopted. We consider our relations with both our union and
non-union employees to be good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
There are risks associated with an investment in our securities. The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our
business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risk factors could materially adversely
affect our business, our prospects, our results of operations, our financial condition, our liquidity, the trading price of our securities, and/or the actual
outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we
currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition in future periods or if
circumstances change.
The loss of the services of Mr. Ralph Lauren, members of our executive management team, or other key personnel could have a material adverse
effect on our business.
Mr. Ralph Lauren's leadership in the design and marketing areas of our business has been a critical element of our success since the inception of our
Company. Mr. R. Lauren is instrumental to, and closely identified with, our brand that bears his name. Our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage
the goodwill associated with Mr. R. Lauren's name may be damaged if we were to lose his services. The death or disability of Mr. R. Lauren or other
extended or permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or industry perception with respect to him or arising from his loss, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We also depend on the service and management experience of other key executive officers and other members of senior management who have
substantial experience and expertise in our industry and our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. Competition in
our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our reputation, our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits,
and economic conditions, among other factors. The loss of the services of any of our key executive officers or other members of senior management, or one
or more of our other key personnel, or the concurrent loss of several of these individuals or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals,
could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We are not protected by a material amount of key-man or similar life insurance covering our executive officers, including Mr. R. Lauren, or other
members of senior management. We have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, but competition for experienced
executives in our industry is intense and the non-compete period with respect to certain of our executive officers could, in some circumstances in the event
of their termination of employment with our Company, end prior to the employment term set forth in their employment agreements.
Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our business could be adversely affected by infectious disease outbreaks, such as the recent novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as
COVID-19. COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe in recent months, including throughout all major geographies in which we operate (North
America, Europe, and Asia), resulting in adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets.
Governments worldwide have imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and
stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus.
In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of our stores,
distribution centers, and corporate facilities, as have our wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors, as described in
Item 1 — "Business — Recent Developments." The COVID-19 pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve on a daily basis. Accordingly, we
cannot predict for how long and to what extent this crisis will impact our business operations or the global economy as a whole. Potential impacts to our
business include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
our ability to successfully execute our long-term growth strategy during these uncertain times;
•
temporary closures of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities for unknown periods of time, as well as those of our wholesale
customers and licensing partners;
•
potential declines in the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, caused by lower
disposal income levels, travel restrictions, or other factors beyond our control;
23
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 25 OF 401]
================================================================================
•
the potential build-up of excess inventory as a result of store closures and/or lower consumer demand, including those resulting from potential
changes in consumer behavior and/or shopping preferences, such as their willingness to congregate in shopping centers or other populated
locations;
•
supply chain disruptions resulting from closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods
produced in infected areas;
•
our ability to access capital markets and maintain compliance with covenants associated with our existing debt instruments, as well as the ability
of our key customers, suppliers, and vendors to do the same in regard to their own obligations;
•
the potential loss of one or more of our significant wholesale customers, or the loss of a large number of smaller wholesale customers, if they are
not able to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions, and our ability to collect outstanding receivables;
•
our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and
•
diversion of management attention and resources from ongoing business activities and/or a decrease in employee morale.
Additional discussion related to the various risks and uncertainties described above is included elsewhere within this "Risk Factors" section of our
Form 10-K.
Economic, political, and other conditions may adversely affect the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products,
including our products.
The industries in which we operate are cyclical. Many economic and other factors outside of our control affect the level of consumer spending in the
apparel, footwear, accessory, and home product industries, including, among others:
•
man-made or natural disasters, including pandemic diseases such as COVID-19;
•
consumer perceptions of personal well-being and safety;
•
consumer perceptions of current and future economic conditions;
•
employment levels and wage rates;
•
stock market performance;
•
inflation;
•
interest rates;
•
foreign currency exchange rates;
•
the housing market;
•
consumer debt levels;
•
the availability of consumer credit;
•
commodity prices, including fuel and energy costs;
•
taxation;
•
general domestic and international political conditions;
•
the threat, outbreak, or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts, or other hostilities; and
•
weather conditions.
Consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, tend to decline during recessionary periods and at
other times when disposable income is lower. Unfavorable economic conditions and other factors, such as disease pandemics and other health-related
concerns, political unrest, war, and acts of terrorism, may also reduce consumers' willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations
in which our stores and shop-within-shops are located.
24
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 26 OF 401]
================================================================================
Further, consumers may prefer to spend more of their discretionary income on "experiences," such as dining and entertainment, over consumer goods. A
downturn or an uncertain outlook in the economies in which we, or our wholesale customers and licensing partners, sell our products may materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See Item 7 — "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Global Economic Conditions and Industry Trends" for further discussion.
Our profitability may decline if we are unable to effectively manage inventory or as a result of increasing pressure on margins.
We have implemented key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and improve the efficiency and responsiveness of our
supply chain. Although we have shortened lead times for the design, sourcing, and production of certain of our product lines, we expect to continue to place
orders with our vendors for the majority of products in advance of the related selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer
preferences and demand and pricing shifts. Our failure to continue to shorten lead times or to correctly anticipate consumer preferences and demand could
result in the build-up of excess inventory. Other factors beyond our control could also result in the build-up of excess inventory, including unforeseen
adverse economic conditions or business disruptions, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Excess inventory levels could result in the
utilization of less-preferred distribution channels, markdowns, promotional sales, destruction, or donations to dispose of such excess or slow-moving
inventory, which may negatively impact our overall profitability and/or impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand
for our products or if manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which may negatively
impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty, and result in lost sales. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, and financial condition.
Additionally, our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition and a highly promotional
retail environment, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes in consumer spending patterns.
Although we continue to limit our promotional activity in connection with our quality of sales initiatives, these factors may cause us to reduce our sales
prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise
offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our costs. If our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating
expenses, our profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition,
changes in our customer, channel, and geographic sales mix could have a negative impact on our profitability.
A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of large wholesale customers. Our business could be adversely affected as a
result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings, other ownership changes in the retail industry, and/or any financial instability of our large
wholesale customers.
Several of our department store customers, including some under common ownership, account for a significant portion of our wholesale net sales. A
substantial portion of sales of our licensed products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest department store customers. During
Fiscal 2020, sales to our three largest wholesale customers, accounted for approximately 18% of total net revenues for Fiscal 2020, and constituted
approximately 32% of our total gross trade accounts receivable outstanding as of March 28, 2020. Substantially all sales to our three largest wholesale
customers related to our North America segment.
We typically do not enter into long-term agreements with our customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our
customers for each of our product lines every season. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether
motivated by economic conditions, financial difficulties, competitive conditions, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise
purchased from us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners or their new strategic and
operational initiatives, including their continued focus on further development of their "private label" initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our wholesale customers have experienced significant business disruptions, including reduced
traffic and temporary store closures. There can be no assurance that our wholesale customers have adequate financial resources and/or access to additional
capital to withstand prolonged periods of such adverse economic conditions. The loss of one or more significant wholesale customers, or the loss of a large
number of smaller wholesale customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
25
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 27 OF 401]
================================================================================
Further, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our large wholesale customers, particularly those located in the U.S., have been highly
promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise, including our products. The continuation of such promotional activity could negatively
impact our brand image and/or lead to requests from those customers for increased markdown allowances at the end of the season, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In response and in connection with our growth plan, we strategically
reduce shipments to certain of our customers when deemed appropriate.
The department store sector has also experienced numerous consolidations, restructurings, reorganizations, and other ownership changes in recent
years, which could potentially increase in frequency in the near-term given the COVID-19 pandemic. Any such actions could result in a reduction in the
number of stores that carry our products, and the stores that remain open may purchase fewer of our products and/or reduce the retail floor space designated
to our brands. There can be no assurance that consolidations, restructurings, reorganizations, or other ownership changes in the department store sector will
not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners across North America,
Europe, Asia, and Australia, and extend credit based on an evaluation of each wholesale customer's financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
However, the financial difficulties of a wholesale customer, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause us to limit or eliminate
our business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to that customer's receivables. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts
receivable from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See
Item 1 — "Business — Wholesale Credit Control."
Economic conditions could have a negative impact on our major customers, suppliers, vendors, and lenders, which in turn could materially
adversely affect our business.
Although we believe that our existing cash and investments, cash provided by operations, and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities
and commercial paper borrowing program will provide us with sufficient liquidity, the impact of economic conditions on our major customers, suppliers,
vendors, and lenders, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and their ability to access global capital markets cannot be predicted. The
inability of major manufacturers to ship our products could impair our ability to meet the delivery date requirements of our customers. Deterioration in
global financial or capital markets could affect our ability to access sources of liquidity to provide for our future cash needs, increase the cost of any future
financing, or cause our lenders to be unable to meet their funding commitments under our credit facilities. A disruption in the ability of our significant
customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in
their future orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We cannot assure the successful implementation of our growth strategy.
We have developed a long-term growth strategy with the objective of delivering sustainable, profitable growth and long-term value creation for
shareholders, as described in Item 1 — "Business — Objectives and Opportunities." Our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy is subject to
various risks and uncertainties, as described within this "Risk Factors" section of our Form 10-K.
Although we believe that our growth strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, there can be no assurance regarding the
timing of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits, if at all. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits, which may be due to our
inability to execute the various elements of our growth strategy, changes in consumer preferences, competition, economic conditions, and other risks
described herein, such as those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial
condition. Such a failure could also result in the implementation of additional restructuring-related activities, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the
short term.
Achievement of our growth strategy may require investment in new capabilities, distribution channels, and technologies. These investments may
result in short-term costs without accompanying current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term. There can be no
assurance regarding the timing of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits of these investments and other costs, if at all.

================================================================================
We may not be successful in the expansion of our multi-channel distribution network or accelerating growth in certain product categories.
Implementation of our growth strategy involves the continuation and expansion of our multi-channel distribution network, including within
international markets such as China, which is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:
•
identify new or underpenetrated markets where our products and brand will be accepted by consumers;
•
attract customers, particularly in new markets;
•
identify desirable freestanding and department store locations, the availability of which may be out of our control;
•
negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances;
•
efficiently and cost effectively build-out stores and shop-within-shops;
•
source sufficient inventory levels to meet the needs of the new stores and shop-within-shops;
•
hire, train, and retain competent store personnel; and
•
integrate new stores and shop-within-shops into our existing systems and operations.
Any of these challenges could delay or otherwise prevent us from successfully executing our distribution expansion strategy. There can be no
assurance that our new stores and shop-within-shops will be successful and profitable or if the capital costs associated with the build-out of such new
locations will be recovered. Further, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new or existing competitors that have a more established
market presence than us or other competitive advantages. Other risks related to our international expansion plans include general economic conditions in
specific countries or markets, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships and any resulting anti-American sentiment, political instability, and foreign
government regulation, among other risks described herein. If our expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our
investments, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
The success of our business also depends on our ability to continue to maintain, enhance, and expand our digital footprint and capabilities.
Consumers are increasingly shopping online using computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices. Any failure on our part, or on the part of our third-
party digital partners, to provide attractive, reliable, secure, and user-friendly digital commerce platforms, including mobile apps, could negatively impact
our customers' shopping experience resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands, and lost sales. In addition, as we continue to
expand and increase the global presence of our digital commerce business, sales from our brick and mortar stores and wholesale channels of distribution in
areas where digital commerce sites are introduced may decline due to changes in consumer shopping habits and cannibalization.
Our growth strategy also includes accelerating growth in certain high-value, underdeveloped product categories, comprised of denim, wear to work,
outerwear, footwear, and accessories. We compete with other retailers in these product categories, some of which may be significantly larger than us and
more established in these product categories, and competition is intense, as described within other risk factors herein. There can be no assurance that our
targeted expansion in these product categories will be successful.
The success of our business depends on our ability to respond to constantly changing fashion and retail trends and consumer preferences in a
timely manner, develop products that resonate with our existing customers and attract new customers, and provide a seamless shopping
experience to our customers.
The industries in which we operate have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. Our success depends
in large part on our ability to originate and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge, and react to changing consumer
preferences in a timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers worldwide whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty
and are subject to rapid change, influenced by fashion trends, current economic conditions, and weather conditions, among other factors. This issue is
further compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared across the
globe. We cannot assure that we will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or successfully meet constantly changing consumer preferences in the
future. In addition, we cannot assure that any new products or brands that we introduce will be successfully received by consumers. Any failure on our part
to anticipate, identify, and respond effectively to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance
of our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for
our products or if
27
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 29 OF 401]
================================================================================
manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. Any of these outcomes could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For a discussion of risks related to our inventory management, see "Our
profitability may decline if we are unable to effectively manage inventory or as a result of increasing pressure on margins."
Our marketing and advertising programs are integral to the success of our product offerings and on our ability to attract new customers and retain
existing customers. Our communication campaigns are increasingly being executed through digital and social media platforms to drive further engagement
with the younger consumer, with a focus on influencers. However, we cannot assure that our marketing and advertising programs will be successful or
appeal to consumers.
The success of our business also depends on our ability to continue to develop and maintain a reliable omni-channel experience for our customers.
Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to a shopping experience through multiple technologies, including computers, smartphones, tablets,
and other devices, as our customers have become increasingly technologically savvy. We are increasingly using digital and social media platforms to
interact with customers and enhance their shopping experience. If we are unable to develop and continuously improve our customer-facing technologies,
we may not be able to provide a convenient and consistent experience to our customers regardless of the sales channel. This could negatively affect our
ability to compete with other retailers and result in diminished loyalty to our brands, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and
financial condition.
We have also implemented, and expect to continue to implement, new store design concepts as part of our growth strategy. There can be no
assurance that any of our store designs will resonate with customers or otherwise achieve the desired sales and profitability measures necessary to recover
our initial capital investments. If customers are not receptive to the design layout or visual merchandising of our stores, our business, results of operations,
and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, the failure of our store designs to achieve acceptable results could lead to our decision to
close a store prior to the lease expiration date. For additional discussion of risks related to the early termination of our leases, see "Our business is subject
to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases."
The success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value and reputation of our brands.
Our success depends on the value and reputation of our brands and our ability to consistently anticipate, identify, and respond to customers'
demands, preferences, and fashion trends in the design, pricing, and production of our products, including the preference for certain products to be
manufactured in the U.S. As the Ralph Lauren name is integral to our business, any negative publicity regarding Mr. R. Lauren or our Company, especially
through social media which accelerates and increases the potential scope of negative publicity, could negatively impact the image of our brands with our
customers and result in diminished loyalty to our brands, even if the subject of such publicity is unverified or inaccurate. There is also increased focus from
consumers, employees, investors, and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters. Although we have established certain
long-term initiatives and goals regarding our impact on the environment and society as a whole, there can be no assurance that our various stakeholders will
agree with our initiatives or if we will be successful in achieving our goals. Our failure to comply with ethical, social, product safety, labor, health,
environmental or other standards and regulations could damage the reputation of our brands and lead to adverse consumer actions and/or investment
decisions by investors, as well as expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Even if we react appropriately to negative publicity,
our customers' perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. Any failure on our part to retain the value and reputation of
brands could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate.
We face increasing competition from companies selling apparel, footwear, accessories, home, and other of our product categories through the
Internet. Although we sell our products through the Internet, increased competition and promotional activity in the worldwide apparel, footwear, accessory,
and home product industries from Internet-based competitors could reduce our sales, prices, and margins and adversely affect our business, results of
operations, and financial condition. We also face intense competition from other domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel, footwear, accessory, and
casual apparel producers that sell products through brick and mortar stores and wholesale and licensing channels. We compete with these companies
primarily on the basis of:
•
anticipating and responding in a timely fashion to changing consumer demands and shopping preferences, including the increasing shift to
digital brand engagement, social media communications, and online shopping;
•
creating and maintaining favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and a reputation for quality;
28
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 30 OF 401]
================================================================================
•
developing and producing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups;
•
competitively pricing our products and creating an acceptable value proposition for consumers;
•
providing strong and effective marketing support;
•
obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at stores and shop-within-shops;
•
attracting consumer traffic to stores, shop-within-shops, and websites;
•
sourcing raw materials at cost-effective prices;
•
anticipating and maintaining proper inventory levels;
•
ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain and distribution efficiencies with third-party manufacturers and retailers;
•
maintaining and growing market share;
•
recruiting and retaining key employees;
•
protecting our intellectual property; and
•
the ability to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions.
Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified and may have greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources,
more desirable store locations, and/or greater digital commerce presence than us, among other competitive advantages. Such competitive advantages may
enable them to better withstand unfavorable economic conditions, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production, and/or more quickly
respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences than us. In addition, technological advances and the retail industry's low barriers to
entry allow for the introduction of new competitors and products at a rapid pace.
Any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced market share or sales, which
could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could restrict our ability to engage in additional capital-related transactions in the future.
As of March 28, 2020, our consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.171 billion, comprised of our outstanding borrowings under our Global
Credit Facility and Senior Notes. Additionally, in accordance with the terms of the original agreement, we have the ability to expand our borrowing
availability under the Global Credit Facility from $500 million to $1 billion through the full term of the facility, subject to the agreement of one or more
new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. Further, in May 2020, we entered into a new credit facility with the same lenders
that are parties to the Global Credit Facility, which provides for an additional $500 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on May
25, 2021, or earlier in the event we are able to obtain other additional financing, as described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.
We rely on our operating cash flows to repay our outstanding borrowings, as well as to fund any working capital needs, capital expenditures,
dividend payments, share repurchases, and other general corporate purposes. Prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions in
any of our key regions, or a combination thereof, such as our recent store closures in North America, Europe, and Asia due to COVID-19, could impede
our ability to pay our obligations as they become due or return value to our shareholders, as well as delay previously planned expenditures related to our
operations.
In addition, certain of our debt instruments contain a number of affirmative and negative covenants. On May 26, 2020, we entered into an
amendment to our Global Credit Facility that relaxed certain financial covenants while providing additional restrictions under our negative covenants for a
specified period of time as further described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our failure to comply with such covenants,
or otherwise secure temporary waivers of non-compliance, could result in our lenders demanding all amounts outstanding to be immediately repaid. Credit
rating agencies also periodically review our capital structure and our ability to generate earnings. A prolonged period of deteriorated financial performance
or our inability to comply with debt covenants could make future financing more difficult to secure and/or expensive.
29
 


================================================================================

================================================================================
Moreover, our Global Credit Facility contains representations and warranties, including that there has been no material adverse change in the business,
operations, property or condition (financial  or otherwise) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a wholes, since March 2019. It is a condition to
making each borrowing and to the issuance, increase, renewal or extension of each letter of credit that our representations be true at the time of the event in
question. The recent amendment to the Global Credit Facility provides that through March 31, 2021, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as disclosed to
the lenders in May 2020 or reasonably foreseeable based on the disclosure to the lenders will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a material
adverse change has occurred.
Further, factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, could disrupt capital markets and limit the availability or willingness of
financial institutions to extend capital to us in the future. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
and financial condition.
Our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks.
Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain our current level of operations in our existing markets is subject to
certain risks associated with operating in various locations around the globe. These include, but are not limited to:
•
complying with a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, trade, labor, product labeling, and product
safety restrictions, as well as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from making improper payments to foreign
officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and similar foreign country laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, which prohibits
U.K. and related companies from any form of bribery;
•
adapting to local customs and culture;
•
unexpected changes in laws, judicial processes, or regulatory requirements;
•
the imposition of additional duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges or other barriers to trade;
•
changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;
•
political instability, such as the recent protests in Hong Kong, and terrorist attacks;
•
pandemic diseases, such as COVID-19; and
•
general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.
Changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social, economic, or monetary policies and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business in
the future or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices. For example, although trade relations between
the U.S. and China have begun to ease, both countries have imposed new tariffs on each other related to the importation of certain product categories,
including imports of apparel into the U.S. from China. As a result of actions to mitigate our exposure to the resulting tariffs, which include diverting
production to and sourcing from other countries, driving productivity within our existing supplier base, and taking pricing actions, the tariffs enacted to
date are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business operations. However, if the U.S. decides to impose additional tariffs on apparel or
other of our goods imported from China, there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset all related increased costs, which could be material to our
business operations as approximately 25% of our products are sourced from China. There have also been recent changes to U.S. participation in, and
discussion regarding the potential renegotiation of, certain international trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, now known
as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. We cannot predict if, and to what extent, there will be changes to international trade agreements or the resulting
impact such changes would have on our business operations. For a discussion of risks associated with the importation of products, see "Our business is
subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications."
Our business could also be impacted by changes to the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. For example, the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (the "OECD"), which represents a coalition of member countries, has proposed changes to numerous long-
standing tax principles through its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among
affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions. In response, certain member countries are beginning to implement legislation to align their
international tax rules with the OECD's recommendations, such as Switzerland’s recently enacted Swiss Tax Act, as described in
Item 1 — "Business — Recent Developments." Taxing authorities of certain state, local, and other foreign jurisdictions may also decide to modify existing
tax
30
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 32 OF 401]
================================================================================
laws. We cannot predict which, if any, of these items or others will be enacted into law or the resulting impact any such enactment will have on our
business operations. However, if new legislation were enacted, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial
condition.
Additionally, the United Kingdom recently withdrew from the European Union, commonly referred to as "Brexit." Although it ceased to be a
member of the European Union effective January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom is now in a “transition period” during which its existing trading
relationship with the European Union will remain in place and it will continue to follow the European Union’s rules. Negotiations during the transition
period to determine the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union post-transition period, including terms of trade, are expected to be
complex. It is not clear at this time what, if any, agreements will be reached by the current December 31, 2020 transition period deadline. Brexit could
significantly disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and result in increased legal
and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. The uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's future
relationship with the European Union could also adversely impact consumer and investor confidence, and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary
items and luxury retail products, including our products. Although we are closely monitoring the latest developments regarding Brexit and are assessing
risk and opportunities and developing strategies to mitigate our exposure once the transition period expires, any of these effects, among others, could
materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Brexit has also contributed to significant volatility and uncertainty in
global stock markets and currency exchange rates, and such volatility could continue to occur as the negotiation process progresses. For a discussion of
risks related to currency exchange fluctuations, see "Our business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations."
Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our
specifications.
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products. Our
products are manufactured to our specifications through arrangements with over 500 foreign manufacturers in various countries. In Fiscal 2020,
approximately 98% of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, with approximately
25% of our products sourced from China. Risks inherent in importing our products include:
•
pandemic diseases, such as COVID-19, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, and scrutiny or
embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;
•
changes in social, political, and economic conditions or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which
our manufacturers or suppliers are located;
•
the imposition of additional regulations, quotas, or safeguards relating to imports or exports, and costs of complying with such regulations and
other laws relating to the identification and reporting of the sources of minerals used in our products;
•
the imposition of additional duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges on imports or exports;
•
unfavorable changes in the availability, cost, or quality of raw materials and commodities;
•
increases in the cost of labor, travel, and transportation;
•
disruptions of shipping and international trade caused by natural and man-made disasters, labor shortages (stemming from labor disputes,
strikes, or otherwise), or other unforeseen events;
•
heightened terrorism-related cargo and supply chain security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more
frequent, or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in the delivery of cargo;
•
decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures, and
damage to the reputation of our brands; and
•
the imposition of sanctions in the form of additional duties either by the U.S. or its trading partners to remedy perceived illegal actions by
national governments.
Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For a discussion of risks
related to the potential imposition of additional regulations and laws, see "Our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal,
regulatory, political, and economic risks."
31
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 33 OF 401]
================================================================================
In addition, the inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our strict quality standards could cause us to
miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries, or a
substantial reduction in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Prices of raw materials used to manufacture our products may also fluctuate significantly as a result of many factors, including general economic
conditions, energy prices, crop yields, and availability of labor and the related costs of such labor. Any increases in prices of such raw materials could have
a material adverse effect on our cost of sales. Furthermore, the cost of labor at many of our third-party manufacturers has been increasing significantly and,
as the middle class in developing countries such as China continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. The cost of transportation
remains significant as well, and it is likely that such cost will fluctuate significantly if oil prices remain volatile. We may not be able to offset such increases
in raw materials, freight, or labor costs through pricing actions or other means.
A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to litigation
risk, and adversely affect our business.
We are dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet, for a significant portion of our direct-to-consumer sales,
including our digital commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing. We are also responsible for storing data
relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our digital commerce websites and for the various social media tools
and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy. In our normal course of business, we often collect, transmit, and/or retain certain sensitive and
confidential customer information, including credit card information. There is significant concern by consumers, employees, and lawmakers alike over the
security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft, and user privacy, as cyber-criminals are becoming increasingly more
sophisticated in their attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and confidential or sensitive data.
Despite the security measures we currently have in place (including those described in Item 1 — "Business — Information Systems"), our facilities
and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, phishing attacks, computer viruses,
malware, ransomware, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other Internet or email events. The increased use of smartphones,
tablets, and other wireless devices, as well as the need for a substantial portion of our corporate employees to work remotely during the COVID-19
pandemic, may also heighten these and other operational risks. The retail industry in particular continues to be the target of many cyber-attacks, which are
becoming increasingly more difficult to anticipate and prevent due to their rapidly evolving nature. Although we have purchased network security and
cyber liability insurance to provide a level of financial protection should a data breach occur, such insurance may not cover us against all claims or costs
associated with such a breach. Additionally, the technology we use to protect our systems from being breached or compromised could become outdated as a
result of advances in computer capabilities or other technological developments. Further, measures we implement to protect our computer systems against
cyber-attacks may make them harder to use or reduce the speed at which they operate, which in turn could negatively impact our customers' shopping
experience resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands, and lost sales.
Any perceived or actual electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential
or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security, whether by us or by a third party, could disrupt our business, severely
damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to risks of litigation, significant fines and penalties, and liability,
and result in deterioration in our customers' and employees' confidence in us, and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial
condition. Since we do not control third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security
breaches will occur in the future, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our employees,
customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, result in lost sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors, and/or reduce our
ability to attract and retain employees and customers. As these threats develop and grow, we may find it necessary to make significant further investments
to protect data and our infrastructure, including the implementation of new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems, deployment of additional
personnel and protection-related technologies, engagement of third-party consultants, and training of employees.
In addition, the regulatory environment relating to information security and privacy is becoming increasingly more demanding with frequent new
requirements surrounding the handling, protection, and use of personal and sensitive information. We may incur significant costs in complying with the
various applicable state, federal, and foreign laws regarding protection of, and unauthorized disclosure of, personal information. Additionally, failing to
comply with such laws and regulations could damage the reputation of our brands and lead to adverse consumer actions, as well as expose us to
government enforcement action and/or private litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

================================================================================
[PAGE 34 OF 401]
================================================================================
Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.
We are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including designing, marketing,
manufacturing, importing, tracking, and distributing our products, processing payments, accounting for and reporting financial results, and managing our
employees and employee benefit programs. In addition, we have digital commerce and other informational websites in North America, Europe, and Asia,
including Australia and New Zealand, and have plans for additional digital commerce sites in the future. Given the complexity of our business and the
significant number of transactions that we engage in on a daily basis, it is imperative that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our computer hardware
and software systems.
Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer
viruses, technical malfunctions, inadequate system capacity, power outages, natural disasters, and usage errors by our employees or third-party consultants.
If our information technology systems become damaged or otherwise cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to repair or
replace them. Additionally, confidential or sensitive data related to our customers or employees could be lost or compromised. We are continually
improving and upgrading our computer systems and software, which also involves risks and uncertainties. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the
design, implementation, or transition of such systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in the sourcing, sale, and shipment of our product, delays
in the collection of cash from our customers, and/or adversely affect our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner. Any material
disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our business could suffer if we need to replace manufacturers or distribution centers.
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products. We
compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers. Some of these competitors may place larger orders than we do, and thus
may have an advantage in securing production capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer of ours must be
replaced, we may have to expand our third-party manufacturing capacity. We cannot guarantee that this additional capacity will be available when required
on terms that are acceptable to us. See Item 1 — "Business - Sourcing, Production and Quality." We enter into purchase order commitments each season
specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications, and other standard industry provisions, but do not have long-term
contracts with any manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively.
In addition, we rely on a number of owned, leased, and independently-operated distribution facilities around the world to warehouse and ship
products to our customers and perform other related logistic services. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on the proper operation of
these distribution centers. Our distributions centers generally utilize computer-controlled and automated equipment, which are subject to various risks,
including software viruses, security breaches, power interruptions, or other system failures. If any of our distribution centers were to close or become
inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, including pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, or if we fail to successfully consolidate existing facilities or
transition to new facilities, we could experience a substantial loss of inventory, disruption of deliveries to our customers and our stores, increased costs, and
longer lead times associated with the distribution of products during the period that would be required to reopen or replace the facility. These disruptions
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We also rely upon third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our
distribution centers, to our stores and shop-within-shops, and to our digital commerce and wholesale customers. Our utilization of these shipping services is
subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, potential labor shortages (stemming from labor disputes, strikes, or otherwise), severe weather, and
pandemic diseases, which could delay the timing of shipments, and increases in wages and fuel prices, which could result in higher transportation costs.
Any delays in the timing of our product shipments or increases in transportation costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, and financial condition.

================================================================================
[PAGE 35 OF 401]
================================================================================
Our business could be adversely affected by man-made or natural disasters and other catastrophic events in the locations in which we or our
customers or suppliers operate.
We have operations, including retail, distribution, and warehousing operations, in locations subject to man-made or natural disasters, including
pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, severe weather, geological events, and other catastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks and military conflict, any
of which could disrupt our operations. In addition, our customers and suppliers also have operations in these locations and could experience similar
disruptions. The occurrence of natural disasters or other catastrophic events may result in sudden disruptions in the business operations of the local
economies affected, as well as of the regional and global economies. The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect financial markets and the
availability of capital. In addition, our business can be affected by unseasonable weather conditions, such as extended periods of unseasonably warm
temperatures in the winter or unseasonably cold temperatures in the summer. Any of these events could result in decreased demand for our products and
disruptions in our sales channels and manufacturing and distribution networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, and financial condition.
Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results.
We are subject to income and non-income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, with the applicable tax rates varying by jurisdiction.
We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any
given time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may
affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as
events occur and exposures are evaluated. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the
mix and level of earnings by jurisdiction or by changes to existing accounting rules. Additionally, our products are subject to import and excise duties,
and/or sales, consumption, value-added taxes ("VAT"), and other non-income taxes in certain international jurisdictions. Failure to correctly calculate or
submit the appropriate amount of income or non-income taxes could subject us to substantial fines and penalties and adversely affect our business, results
of operations, and financial condition.
In addition, the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate may change, such as the recently-enacted Swiss Tax Act, or there may be
changes in interpretation and enforcement of existing tax laws, which could materially affect our income tax expense in our consolidated financial
statements. For a discussion of risks related to the potential imposition of additional regulations and laws, see "Our ability to conduct business globally may
be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks."
Our business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations.
Our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. Specifically, changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies
impact our financial results from a transactional perspective, as our foreign operations generally purchase inventory in U.S. dollars, as is common for most
apparel companies. Given that we source most of our products overseas, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant
currencies. Changes in currency exchange rates may also impact consumers' willingness or ability to travel abroad and/or purchase our products while
traveling, as well as affect the U.S. Dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international businesses sell products.
Additionally, the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as their financial
results are translated from the respective local currency into U.S. Dollars during the financial statement consolidation process. The foreign currencies to
which we are exposed to from a transactional and translational perspective primarily include the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the
Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi. The expansion of our international business
increases our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.
Although we hedge certain exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot fully
anticipate all of our currency exposures and therefore foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of
operations, and financial condition. In addition, factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging activities include the volatility of currency
markets, the accuracy of forecasted transactions, and the availability of hedging instruments. As such, our hedging activities may not completely mitigate
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations. See Item 7 — "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations — Market Risk Management."

================================================================================
Our business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases.
We generally operate most of our stores and corporate facilities under long-term, non-cancellable leasing arrangements. Our retail store leases
typically require us to make minimum rental payments, and often contingent rental payments based upon sales. In addition, our leases generally require us
to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance, and utilities. We generally cannot cancel our leases at our option. If we decide
to close a store, or if we decide to downsize, consolidate, or relocate any of our corporate facilities, we may be required to record an impairment charge
and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store or corporate facility. In addition, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among
other things, payment of the base rent for the remaining lease term, even after the space is exited or otherwise closed (such as our recent temporary store
closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic). Such costs and obligations related to the early or temporary closure of our stores or termination of our
leases could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, as each of our leases naturally
expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could lead to store closures resulting in lost sales.
The trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial
performance, including our ability to return value to shareholders.
Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any
particular fiscal quarter. We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders. At the same time, however, we
recognize that, from time to time, it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our quarterly and annual forecast of net sales and earnings.
While we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we do not have any responsibility to update
any of our guidance or other forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. In addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on
goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable. However, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our
current quarter and full fiscal year expectations. Additionally, external analysts and investors may publish their own independent predictions of our future
performance. We do not endorse such predictions or assume any responsibility to correct such predictions when they differ from our own expectations. If,
or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside analysts, or others, the market price of our securities
could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own
risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.
In addition, we periodically return value to shareholders through our payment of quarterly cash dividends and common stock share repurchases.
Investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends, further increase our cash dividend rate, and/or repurchase shares
available under our Class A common stock repurchase program. Our ability to pay quarterly cash dividends and repurchase our Class A common stock will
depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive,
and other factors that are beyond our control, such as impacts related to COVID-19, which has resulted in us temporarily suspending our quarterly cash
dividend and share repurchases during the crisis. Further, our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, elect to suspend or otherwise alter these programs at
any time. The market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend payments and/or Class A common stock share repurchase
activity differ from investors' expectations.
We may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring plans.
We have implemented restructuring plans to support key strategic initiatives, such as the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan, as described in
Item 1 — "Business — Recent Developments." Although designed to deliver long-term sustainable growth, restructuring plans present significant potential
risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, including:
•
higher than anticipated costs in implementing planned workforce reductions, particularly in highly regulated locations outside the U.S.;
•
higher than anticipated lease termination and store closure costs (see "Our business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and
other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases");
•
failure to meet operational targets or customer requirements due to the loss of employees or inadequate transfer of knowledge;
•
failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing, and subsequent to completing, our restructuring plans;
35
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 37 OF 401]
================================================================================
•
diversion of management attention and resources from ongoing business activities and/or a decrease in employee morale;
•
attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce; and
•
damage to our reputation and brand image due to our restructuring-related activities, including the closure of certain of our stores.
If we are not successful in implementing and managing our restructuring plans, we may not be able to achieve targeted operating enhancements,
sales growth, and/or cost reductions, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our failure to achieve
targeted results for any reason, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, could also lead to the implementation of additional restructuring-related
activities, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term.
Changes in our executive and senior management team may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business.
Certain members of our executive and senior management team have departed in recent years, and we may implement other management and
organizational changes in connection with our growth strategy. Any changes in our executive and senior management team may be disruptive to, or cause
uncertainty in, our business and future strategic direction. The departure of certain key individuals and the failure to ensure a smooth transition and
effective transfer of knowledge involving senior employees could hinder or delay our strategic planning and execution, as well as adversely affect our
ability to attract and retain other experienced and talented employees. Further, our recent decision to furlough a significant portion of our employees in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic could disrupt our business operations and processes, as well as our ability to maintain an effective system of internal
controls and compliance with the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any such disruption or uncertainty could have a material adverse
impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the U.S.
We believe that our trademarks, intellectual property, and other proprietary rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive
position. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities worldwide. However,
significant counterfeiting and imitation of our products continue to exist. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect trademarks or
other proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. and, as a result, our intellectual property may be more vulnerable and difficult to
protect in such countries. Over the course of our international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or
claimed ownership rights to some of our key trademarks that include Polo and/or a representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise have
contested our rights to our trademarks. We have resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements. We cannot
guarantee that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting, lost
business, or brand dilution, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to
challenge brands arising from imitation of our products. Also, there can be no assurance that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks
and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction or at all. See Item 1 —
"Business — Trademarks," and Item 3 — "Legal Proceedings."
Our business could suffer if we fail to comply with labor laws or if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental
practices.
We are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, and
citizenship requirements. Compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to
governmental investigations or litigation.
In addition, we require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While
our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our employees periodically visit and monitor the operations of our
independent manufacturers, we do not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The violation of labor, environmental, or other laws by an
independent manufacturer used by us or one of our licensing partners, or the divergence of an independent manufacturer's or licensing partner's labor or
environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the U.S., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished
products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and
financial condition.

================================================================================
[PAGE 38 OF 401]
================================================================================
Certain legal proceedings, regulatory matters, and accounting changes could adversely affect our business.
We are involved in certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters and are subject from time to time to various claims involving alleged breach of
contract claims, intellectual property and other related claims, escheatment and unclaimed property, credit card fraud, security breaches in certain of our
retail store information systems, employment issues, consumer matters, and other litigation. Certain of these lawsuits and claims, if decided adversely to us
or settled by us, could result in material liability to our Company or have a negative impact on our reputation or relations with our employees, customers,
licensees, or other third parties. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings could result in
substantial costs and may require our Company to devote substantial time and resources to defend itself. Further, changes in governmental regulations both
in the U.S. and in other countries where we conduct business operations could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial
condition. See Item 3 — "Legal Proceedings" for further discussion of our Company's legal matters.
In addition, we are subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other
regulatory agencies. If and when effective, such changes to accounting standards could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See
Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain recently issued accounting standards.
The voting shares of our Company's stock are concentrated in one majority stockholder.
As of March 28, 2020, Mr. Ralph Lauren, or entities controlled by the Lauren family, held approximately 84% of the voting power of the
outstanding common stock of our Company. In addition, Mr. R. Lauren serves as our Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, Mr. R. Lauren's son,
Mr. David Lauren, serves as our Chief Innovation Officer, Strategic Advisor to the CEO, and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, and we employ
other members of the Lauren family. From time to time, we may have other business dealings with Mr. R. Lauren, members of the Lauren family, or
entities affiliated with Mr. R. Lauren or the Lauren family. As a result of his stock ownership and position in our Company, Mr. R. Lauren has the ability to
exercise significant control over our business, including, without limitation, (i) the election of our Class B common stock directors, voting separately as a
class and (ii) any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the
approval of mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets.
We rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses. Failure to maintain licensing partners could harm our business.
The risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks specific to a licensing
partner's business, including risks associated with a particular licensing partner's ability to:
•
obtain capital;
•
execute its business plans;
•
manage its labor relations;
•
maintain relationships with its suppliers and customers; and
•
manage its credit and bankruptcy risks effectively.
Although a number of our license agreements prohibit our licensing partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our competitors, our
licensing partners generally are not precluded from offering, under other non-competitor brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements
with us. A substantial portion of sales of our products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest customers. While we have significant
control over our licensing partners' products and advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other things, operational and financial control
over their businesses. Changes in management, reduced sales of licensed products, poor execution, or financial difficulties with respect to any of our
licensing partners could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other
products.
Although we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners in most circumstances, if necessary, our inability to do so for any period of
time could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products.
See Item 1 — "Business — Our Licensing Business."

extend our retail store leases, as well as those leases for our non-retail facilities, which expire in the near future on satisfactory terms or relocate to desirable
alternate locations. We generally lease our freestanding retail stores for initial periods ranging from 5 to 15 years, with renewal options. See
Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Our business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases."

Item 3.
Legal Proceedings.
We are involved, from time to time, in litigation, other legal claims, and proceedings involving matters associated with or incidental to our business,
including, among other things, matters involving credit card fraud, trademark and other intellectual property, licensing, importation and exportation of
products, taxation, unclaimed property, and employee relations. We believe at present that the resolution of currently pending matters will not individually
or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, our assessment of any litigation or other legal claims
could potentially change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known or determinations by judges, juries, or other finders of fact which are not in
accord with management's evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or claims.

Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
As of May 22, 2020, there were 667 holders of record of our Class A common stock and 6 holders of record of our Class B common stock. Our
Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "RL." All of our outstanding shares of Class B common
stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren, Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family. Shares of our Class B
common stock may be converted immediately into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis by the holder. There is no cash or other consideration paid
by the holder converting the shares and, accordingly, there is no cash or other consideration received by the Company. The shares of Class A common stock
issued by the Company in such conversions are exempt from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. No shares
of our Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock during the fiscal quarter ended March 28, 2020.

reflecting the May 13, 2019 approval by our Board of Directors to expand the program by up to an additional $600 million of Class A common
stock repurchases. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions. Accordingly, as a
result of current business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended our common stock repurchase
program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity.

OVERVIEW
Our Business
Our Company is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear, accessories,
home furnishings, fragrances, and hospitality. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across an expanding number of
products, brands, sales channels, and international markets. Our brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren Purple Label,
Polo Ralph Lauren, Double RL, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, Chaps, and Club Monaco, among others.
We diversify our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and
licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or
channel of distribution. We sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-
shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-
party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which we have licensed the right to operate in defined geographic
territories using our trademarks. In addition, we license to third parties for specified periods the right to access our various trademarks in connection with
the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.

================================================================================
[PAGE 43 OF 401]
================================================================================
We organize our business into the following three reportable segments:
•
North America — Our North America segment, representing approximately 51% of our Fiscal 2020 net revenues, primarily consists of sales
of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S. and Canada, excluding Club Monaco. In
North America, our retail business is comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, and our digital commerce site,
www.RalphLauren.com. Our wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, and to a lesser extent,
specialty stores.
•
Europe — Our Europe segment, representing approximately 26% of our Fiscal 2020 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph
Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America, excluding Club
Monaco. In Europe, our retail business is comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops,
and our various digital commerce sites. Our wholesale business in Europe is comprised of a varying mix of sales to both department stores
and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital partners.
•
Asia — Our Asia segment, representing approximately 17% of our Fiscal 2020 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren
branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Our retail business in Asia is
primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our digital commerce site,
www.RalphLauren.cn, which launched in September 2018. In addition, we sell our products online through various third-party digital partner
commerce sites. In Asia, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, with related products distributed
through shop-within-shops.
No operating segments were aggregated to form our reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable
segments, representing approximately 6% of our Fiscal 2020 net revenues, which primarily consist of (i) sales of Club Monaco branded products made
through our retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and our licensing alliances in Europe and Asia, and (ii) royalty revenues
earned through our global licensing alliances, excluding Club Monaco.
Effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, operating results related to our business in Latin America are included within our Europe
segment due to a change in how we manage this business. Previously, such results were included within our other non-reportable segments. All prior period
segment information has been recast to reflect this change on a comparative basis.
Approximately 46% of our Fiscal 2020 net revenues were earned outside of the U.S. See Note 20 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.
Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale
sales in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping
periods impacting our retail business and the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments.
Recent Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic
A novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe in recent months, including throughout all
major geographies in which we operate (North America, Europe, and Asia), resulting in adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well as
significant volatility in global financial markets. Governments worldwide have imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as
temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such factors, among others, have
resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. Additionally, during this period of uncertainty,
companies across a wide array of industries have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating expenses and preserve cash balances, including work
furloughs and reduced pay, which could lower consumers’ disposable income levels or willingness to purchase discretionary items. Further, even after such
government restrictions and company initiatives are lifted, consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences, such as their willingness to
congregate in shopping centers or other populated locations, could be adversely affected.
In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of our stores,
distribution centers, and corporate facilities, as have our wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors. For example, a significant number
of our stores in parts of Asia were closed for a substantial portion of our fourth
42
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 44 OF 401]
================================================================================
quarter of Fiscal 2020. Although our stores in Asia were largely reopened by the end of our Fiscal 2020, certain countries, including Japan, began imposing
new restrictions during our first quarter of Fiscal 2021. Retail traffic also continues to be challenging in those regions in which our stores are open.
Additionally, our stores in North America and the majority in Europe closed mid-March or earlier, and although certain stores have since reopened, a large
number remain closed and we are uncertain when they will reopen. Our wholesale business has also been adversely affected, particularly in North America
and Europe, as a result of department store closures and lower traffic and consumer demand.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken preemptive actions to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity, including:
•
drawing down $475 million from our Global Credit Facility to bolster cash balances;
•
entering into a new credit facility with the same lenders that are parties to the Global Credit Facility, which provides for an additional $500 million
senior unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on May 25, 2021, or earlier in the event we are able to obtain other additional financing, as
described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements;
•
temporarily suspending our common stock repurchase program and our quarterly cash dividend;
•
temporarily reducing the base compensation of our executives and senior management team, as well as our Board of Directors;
•
carefully managing our expense structure across all key areas of spend, including aligning inventory levels with anticipated demand and
postponing non-critical capital build-out and other investments and activities; and
•
temporarily furloughing or reducing work hours for a significant portion of our employees who nevertheless remain eligible for employee benefits
during such period.
The COVID-19 pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve on a daily basis. Accordingly, we cannot predict for how long and to what
extent this crisis will impact our business operations or the global economy as a whole. We will continue to assess our operations location-by-location,
taking into account the guidance of local governments and global health organizations to determine when our operations can begin returning to normal
course of business. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse
effect on our business" for additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Swiss Tax Reform
In May 2019, a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (the "Swiss Tax Act"),
which became effective January 1, 2020. The Swiss Tax Act eliminates certain preferential tax items at both the federal and cantonal levels for
multinational companies and provides the cantons with parameters for establishing local tax rates and regulations. The Swiss Tax Act also provides
transitional provisions, one of which allows eligible companies to increase the tax basis of certain assets based on the value generated by their business in
previous years, and to amortize such adjustment as a tax deduction over a transitional period. In connection with this transitional provision, we recorded a
one-time income tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset of $122.9 million during Fiscal 2020, which decreased our effective tax rate by 3,760
basis points.
See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the Swiss Tax Act.
Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan
On June 4, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan associated with our strategic objective of operating with discipline to drive
sustainable growth (the "Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan"). The Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan includes the following restructuring-related activities: (i)
rightsizing and consolidation of our global distribution network and corporate offices; (ii) targeted severance-related actions; and (iii) closure of certain of
our stores and shop-within-shops. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan are expected to result in gross annualized expense savings of
approximately $60 million to $80 million.
In connection with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan, we have recorded cumulative charges of $145.8 million since its inception, of which $48.5
million and $97.3 million were recorded during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Actions
43
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 45 OF 401]
================================================================================
associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan are complete and no additional charges are expected to be incurred in connection with this plan.
See Note 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal
2019 Restructuring Plan.
U.S. Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA"),
which became effective January 1, 2018. The TCJA significantly revised U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, lowering the U.S. federal statutory
income tax rate from 35% to 21%, creating a territorial tax system that includes a one-time mandatory transition tax on previously deferred foreign
earnings, and eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions.
During Fiscal 2018, we recorded net charges of $221.4 million within our income tax provision in connection with the TCJA, which increased our
effective tax rate by 4,520 basis points. Subsequently, during Fiscal 2019, we recorded net measurement period adjustments of $27.6 million as permitted
by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"). These measurement period adjustments increased our effective tax rate by 470 basis points during
Fiscal 2019.
See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the TCJA.
Global Economic Conditions and Industry Trends
The global economy and retail industry are impacted by many different factors. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in heightened
uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. As discussed in "Recent
Developments," governments worldwide have imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced
business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such actions, together with changes in consumers' willingness
to congregate in populated areas and lower levels of disposal income due to rising unemployment rates, have resulted in significant business disruptions
across a wide array of industries and an overall decline of the global economy.
The global economy has also been impacted by the domestic and international political environment, including volatile international trade relations
and political unrest. Although trade relations between the U.S. and China have begun to ease, both countries have imposed new tariffs on each other related
to the importation of certain product categories. Concerns also exist regarding the United Kingdom's recent withdrawal from the European Union,
commonly referred to as "Brexit." The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the European Union, effective January 31, 2020, and has entered a
"transition period" during which its existing trading relationship with the European Union will remain in place and it will continue to follow the European
Union's rules. Negotiations during the transition period to determine the United Kingdom's future relationship with the European Union, including terms of
trade, are expected to be complex. It is not clear at this time what, if any, agreements will be reached by the current December 31, 2020 transition period
deadline and the resulting impact on consumer sentiment. Additionally, certain other worldwide events, including political protests such as those that
recently took place in Hong Kong, acts of terrorism, taxation or monetary policy changes, fluctuations in commodity prices, and rising healthcare costs,
also increase volatility in the global economy.
The retail landscape in which we operate has been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including widespread temporary closures of
stores and distribution centers and declines in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,
consumers had been increasingly shifting their shopping preference from physical stores to online. This shift in preference could potentially be amplified in
the future as a byproduct of the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumers may prefer to avoid populated locations, such as shopping centers, in fear of exposing
themselves to infectious diseases. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, many retailers, including certain of our large wholesale customers, have been
highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise on a periodic basis in an attempt to offset declines in physical store traffic. The
retail industry, particularly in the U.S., has also experienced numerous bankruptcies, restructurings, and ownership changes in recent years. The COVID-19
pandemic could exacerbate these trends if companies do not have adequate financial resources and/or access to additional capital to withstand prolonged
periods of adverse economic conditions. The continuation of these industry trends could further impact consumer spending and consumption behavior in
our industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.
We have implemented various strategies globally to help address many of these current challenges and continue to build a foundation for long-term
profitable growth centered around strengthening our consumer-facing areas of product, stores, and
44

================================================================================
marketing across channels and driving a more efficient operating model. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken preemptive actions to
preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity, as described in "Recent Developments." Investing in our digital ecosystem remains a primary focus and is a key
component of our integrated global omni-channel strategy, particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which could reshape consumer
shopping preferences. We also continue to take deliberate actions to ensure promotional consistency across channels and to enhance the overall brand and
shopping experience, including better aligning shipments and inventory levels with underlying demand. We also remain committed to optimizing our
wholesale distribution channel and enhancing our department store consumer experience. Further, in response to the recent trade developments between the
U.S. and China, we have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to the resulting tariffs, including diverting production to and sourcing from other countries,
driving productivity within our existing supplier base, and taking pricing actions. As a result of these efforts, the tariffs enacted to date are not expected to
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We are also closely monitoring the latest Brexit developments and are assessing risks and
opportunities and developing strategies to mitigate our exposure once the transition period expires, including evaluating scenarios in which the transition
period ends without trade agreements in place.
We will continue to monitor these conditions and trends and will evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and foreign currency and cost
management opportunities to help mitigate the related impacts on our results of operations, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our
business and protecting and elevating the value of our brand.
For a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see
Part I, Item 1A — "Risk Factors" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Summary of Financial Performance
Operating Results
In Fiscal 2020, we reported net revenues of $6.160 billion, net income of $384.3 million, and net income per diluted share of $4.98, as compared to
net revenues of $6.313 billion, net income of $430.9 million, and net income per diluted share of $5.27 in Fiscal 2019. The comparability of our operating
results has been affected by adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions, as well as restructuring-related charges,
impairment of assets, and certain other charges. Our operating results have also been affected by international and domestic tax reform.
Our operating performance for Fiscal 2020 reflected revenue declines of 2.4% on a reported basis and 1.2% on a constant currency basis, as defined
within "Transactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" below, reflecting adverse impacts related to
COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions.
Our gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased by 230 basis points to 59.3% during Fiscal 2020, primarily driven by inventory charges
recorded in connection with COVID-19 business disruptions, partially offset by favorable geographic, channel, and product mix, improved pricing, and
lower levels of promotional activity.
Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased by 240 basis points to 52.6% during Fiscal 2020,
primarily driven by operating deleverage on lower net revenues and higher bad debt expense, both largely attributable to COVID-19 business disruptions,
as well as the unfavorable impact attributable to geographic and channel mix.
Net income decreased by $46.6 million to $384.3 million in Fiscal 2020 as compared to Fiscal 2019, primarily due to a $244.8 million decrease in
operating income reflecting adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions, partially offset by a $209.5 million
decrease in our income tax provision largely driven by the combined impact of international and domestic tax reform. Net income per diluted share
decreased by $0.29 to $4.98 per share in Fiscal 2020 as compared to Fiscal 2019, due to lower net income, partially offset by lower weighted-average
diluted shares outstanding during Fiscal 2020.
Net income during Fiscal 2020 reflected a one-time income tax benefit of $122.9 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, recorded in connection with the
Swiss Tax Act and and net income during Fiscal 2019 reflected TCJA enactment-related charges of $27.6 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. Our operating
results during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 were also negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets (including an equity
method investment), and certain other charges (including those related to COVID-19 business disruptions) totaling $321.8 million and $163.1 million,
respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $244.8 million, or $3.17 per diluted share, and $129.0 million, or $1.58 per diluted
share, respectively.

================================================================================
Financial Condition and Liquidity
We ended Fiscal 2020 in a net cash and investments position (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term and non-current investments, less total debt)
of $945.3 million, compared to $1.343 billion as of the end of Fiscal 2019. The decrease in our net cash and investments position was primarily due to our
use of cash to support Class A common stock repurchases of $694.8 million, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based
compensation awards, to invest in our business through $270.3 million in capital expenditures, and to make dividend payments of $203.9 million, partially
offset by our operating cash flows of $754.6 million.
We generated $754.6 million of cash from operations during Fiscal 2020, compared to $783.8 million during Fiscal 2019. The decline in cash
provided by operating activities was due to a decrease in net income before non-cash charges, partially offset by a net favorable change related to our
operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year period.
Our equity decreased to $2.693 billion as of March 28, 2020, compared to $3.287 billion as of March 30, 2019, primarily due to our share
repurchase activity, dividends declared, and cumulative adjustments from our adoption of new accounting standards, partially offset by our comprehensive
income and the impact of stock-based compensation arrangements during Fiscal 2020.

[PAGE 48 OF 401]
================================================================================
Since we are a global company, the comparability of our operating results reported in U.S. Dollars is also affected by foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which we transact change in value over time compared to the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations can have a
significant effect on our reported results. As such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP"), our discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating current-year and prior-
year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. We present constant currency financial information,
which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to our reported operating results. We use constant currency information to provide a
framework for assessing how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe this information is
useful to investors for facilitating comparisons of operating results and better identifying trends in our businesses. The constant currency performance
measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Reconciliations between this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included in the "Results of
Operations" section where applicable.
Our discussion also includes reference to comparable store sales. Comparable store sales refer to the change in sales of our stores that have been
open for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales from our digital commerce sites are also included within comparable sales for those geographies that have been
serviced by the related site for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales for stores or digital commerce sites that are closed or shut down during the year are
excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of
25% or greater), or generally closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until
such stores have been operating in their new location or in their newly renovated state for at least 13 full fiscal months. All comparable store sales metrics
are calculated on a constant currency basis.
Our "Results of Operations" discussion that follows includes the significant changes in operating results arising from these items affecting
comparability. However, unusual items or transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and other financial statement users should consider
the types of events and transactions that have affected operating trends.

unfavorable foreign currency effects of $1.4 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $61.0 million, or 1.9%, reflecting adverse
impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions.
The $62.4 million net decline in North America net revenues was driven by:
•
a $101.2 million net decrease related to our North America wholesale business, largely driven by weaker demand and challenging department
store traffic trends, as well as COVID-19 business disruptions.
This decrease was partially offset by:
•
an increase of $38.8 million related to our North America retail business, inclusive of net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $0.7 million
and the adverse impact of COVID-19 business disruptions. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $39.5 million driven by
an increase of $47.1 million in non-comparable store sales, partially offset by a decrease of $7.6 million in comparable store sales. The

Europe net revenues — Net revenues decreased by $50.8 million, or 3.0%, during Fiscal 2020 as compared to Fiscal 2019, including net unfavorable
foreign currency effects of $63.6 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $12.8 million, or 0.8%, despite adverse impacts related to
COVID-19 business disruptions.
The $50.8 million net decline in Europe net revenues was driven by:
•
a $44.3 million net decrease related to our Europe wholesale business driven by net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $32.3 million and
COVID-19 business disruptions, partially offset by stronger demand prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; and
•
a $6.5 million net decrease related to our Europe retail business, inclusive of net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $31.3 million and the
adverse impact of COVID-19 business disruptions. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $24.8 million driven by an

Asia net revenues — Net revenues decreased by $23.8 million, or 2.3%, during Fiscal 2020 as compared to Fiscal 2019, including net unfavorable
foreign currency effects of $11.6 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $12.2 million, or 1.2%, reflecting estimated adverse
impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions.
The $23.8 million net decline in Asia net revenues was driven by:
•

Gross Profit.    Gross profit decreased by $232.7 million, or 6.0%, to $3.653 billion in Fiscal 2020, including net unfavorable foreign currency
effects of $53.7 million. The decline in gross profit reflects adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions, including
incremental inventory charges of $157.3 million. Gross profit during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 also reflected inventory charges of $2.2 million and $7.2
million, respectively, recorded in connection with our restructuring plans. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 59.3% in Fiscal 2020
from 61.6% in Fiscal 2019.

[PAGE 52 OF 401]
================================================================================
The 230 basis point decline was primarily driven by higher inventory charges and deleverage on lower net revenues, partially offset by favorable
geographic, channel, and product mix, improved pricing, and lower levels of promotional activity.
Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution
channels, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material
costs. These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.    SG&A expenses include compensation and benefits, advertising and marketing, rent and
occupancy, distribution, information technology, legal, depreciation and amortization, bad debt, and other selling and administrative costs. SG&A expenses
increased by $69.2 million, or 2.2%, to $3.238 billion in Fiscal 2020, including net favorable foreign currency effect of $35.5 million. The increase in
SG&A expenses reflects net adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions, including incremental bad debt expense of
$56.4 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 52.6% in Fiscal 2020 from 50.2% in Fiscal 2019. The 240 basis point increase
was primarily due to operating deleverage on lower net revenues and higher bad debt expense, both primarily attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, as
well as the unfavorable impact attributable to geographic and channel mix, as a greater portion of our revenue was generated by our retail businesses
(which typically carry higher operating expense margins).

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are carefully managing our expense structure across all areas of spend, including temporarily
postponing non-critical capital build-out and other investments and activities. However, we remain committed to spending on key strategic initiatives
including marketing, digital, expanding and renovating our global retail stores and concession shops, and investing in productivity-enhancing
infrastructure. We expect to make these investments while continuing to manage our cost base with discipline.
Impairment of Assets.   During Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $31.6 million and $21.2 million,
respectively, to write-down certain long-lived assets in connection with our restructuring plans and identification of underperforming stores. Additionally,
as a result of our decision to sell our corporate jet in connection with our cost savings initiative, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $4.6 million
during Fiscal 2019 to reduce the carrying value of the asset held-for-sale to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. See Note 8 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.
Restructuring and Other Charges.   During Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $37.6 million and $93.6 million,
respectively, in connection with our restructuring plans, primarily consisting of severance and benefits costs, as well as a loss on sale of property during the
prior fiscal year period. Additionally, during Fiscal 2020, we recorded other charges of $29.6 million primarily related to the charitable donation of the net
cash proceeds received from the sale of our corporate jet, and rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations for
which the related lease agreements have not yet expired. During Fiscal 2019, we recorded other charges of $36.5 million primarily related to our sabbatical
leave program initiated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, depreciation expense associated with our former Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New
York City, and a customs audit. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Operating Income.    Operating income decreased by $244.8 million, or 43.6%, to $317.0 million in Fiscal 2020, including net unfavorable foreign
currency effect of $18.2 million. The decline in operating income reflects net adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business
disruptions, including total incremental inventory charges and bad debt expense of $213.7 million, as previously discussed. Our operating results during
Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 were also negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges totaling $101.0
million and $163.1 million, respectively, as previously discussed. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 5.1% in Fiscal 2020 from
8.9% in Fiscal 2019. The 380 basis point decline was primarily driven by the decline in our gross margin and the increase in SG&A expenses as a
percentage of net revenues, partially offset by lower restructuring-related charges recorded during Fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year, all as
previously discussed.

North America operating margin declined by 580 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of 440 basis points related to incremental
inventory charges and bad debt expense recorded in connection with COVID-19 business disruptions. The remaining 140 basis point decline largely related
to adverse market conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Europe operating margin declined by 270 basis points, primarily due to the net unfavorable impact of 210 basis points related to incremental
inventory charges and bad debt expense recorded in connection with COVID-19 business disruptions, partially offset by lower non-cash charges recorded
in connection with our restructuring plans during Fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The decline in operating margin also reflected a 40 basis
point decline largely related to adverse market conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a 20 basis point decline related unfavorable
foreign currency.
Asia operating margin declined by 320 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of 160 basis points related to incremental inventory
charges and bad debt expense recorded in connection with COVID-19 business disruptions. The remaining 160 basis point decline largely related to
adverse market conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and Hong Kong protests.
Unallocated corporate expenses decreased by $14.7 million to $648.7 million in Fiscal 2020. The decline in unallocated corporate expenses was due
to lower compensation-related expenses of $11.5 million, lower staff-related expenses of $8.8 million, lower consulting fees of $6.7 million, and lower
marketing and advertising expenses of $5.9 million, partially offset by lower intercompany sourcing commission income of $10.2 million (which is offset
at the segment level and eliminates in consolidation) and higher other expenses of $8.0 million.
Unallocated restructuring and other charges decreased by $62.9 million to $67.2 million in Fiscal 2020, as previously discussed above and in Note
9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

================================================================================
Non-operating Income (Expense), Net.    Non-operating income (expense), net is comprised of interest expense, interest income, and other income
(expense), net, which includes foreign currency gains (losses), equity in income (losses) from our equity-method investees, and other non-operating
expenses. During Fiscal 2020, we reported non-operating income, net, of $9.4 million, as compared to $20.7 million in Fiscal 2019. The $11.3 million
decline was primarily driven by:
•
an $8.0 million increase in other expense, net, driven by a $7.1 million impairment of an equity method investment. See Note 8 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements; and
•
a $6.4 million decrease in interest income driven by the lower balance of our investment portfolio, as well as lower interest rates in financial
markets during Fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year.
Income Tax Benefit (Provision).    The income tax benefit (provision) represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. We reported an
income tax benefit and effective tax rate of $57.9 million and (17.7%), respectively, in Fiscal 2020, as compared to an income tax provision and effective
tax rate of $151.6 million and 26.0%, respectively, in Fiscal 2019. The $209.5 million decline in the income tax provision was largely driven by lower
pretax income primarily due to the adverse impacts of COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions. The decline in our income provision also
reflected a one-time benefit of $122.9 million recorded in Fiscal 2020 in connection with the Swiss Tax Act, which lowered our effective tax rate by 3,760
basis points, as well as the absence of a $27.6 million TCJA enactment-related charge recorded in the prior fiscal year, which negatively impacted our prior
fiscal year effective tax rate by 470 basis points. In addition to this combined 4,230 basis point improvement related to tax reform impacts, the decline in
our effective tax rate also reflected the net favorable impact of 140 basis points primarily attributable to other factors, including the tax impacts of earnings
in lower taxed foreign jurisdictions versus the U.S. and favorable provision to tax return adjustments, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of
additional income tax reserves associated with certain income tax audits. Our effective tax rate will change from period to period based on various factors
including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax
audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for
discussion regarding the Swiss Tax Act and TCJA.
Net Income.    Net income decreased to $384.3 million in Fiscal 2020, from $430.9 million in Fiscal 2019. The $46.6 million decline in net income
was primarily due to the decrease in our operating income, partially offset by the decrease in our income tax provision, both as previously discussed. Net
income during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 reflected a one-time income tax benefit of $122.9 million recorded in connection with Swiss tax reform and
TCJA enactment-related charges of $27.6 million, respectively, both as previously discussed. Our operating results during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019
were also negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets (including an equity method investment), and certain other charges
(including those related to COVID-19 business disruptions) totaling $321.8 million and $163.1 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of
reducing net income by $244.8 million and $129.0 million, respectively.
Net Income per Diluted Share.    Net income per diluted share decreased to $4.98 in Fiscal 2020, from $5.27 in Fiscal 2019. The $0.29 per share
decline was due to the lower level of net income, as previously discussed, partially offset by lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during
Fiscal 2020 driven by our share repurchases during the last twelve months. Net income per diluted share in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 were favorably
impacted by $1.59 per share as a result of a one-time income tax benefit recorded in connection with the Swiss Tax Act and negatively impacted by $0.34
per share as a result of TCJA enactment-related charges, respectively, both as previously discussed. Net income per diluted share in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal
2019 were also negatively impacted by $3.17 per share and $1.58 per share, respectively, as a result of restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets
(including an equity method investment), and certain other charges (including those related to COVID-19 business disruptions), as previously discussed.

North America net revenues — Net revenues decreased by $28.1 million, or 0.9%, during Fiscal 2019 as compared to Fiscal 2018, including net
unfavorable foreign currency effects of $3.3 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $24.8 million, or 0.8%.
The $28.1 million net decline in North America net revenues was driven by a $57.0 million net decrease related to our North America wholesale
business, largely driven by a strategic reduction of shipments (including within the off-price channel) and points of distribution in connection with our
long-term growth strategy.
This decline was partially offset by:
•
a $28.9 million net increase related to our North America retail business, inclusive of net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $1.8 million.
On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $30.7 million driven by an increase of $30.3 million in non-comparable store sales.

an $11.7 million net increase related to our Asia wholesale business, primarily driven by our expansion in Japan, South Korea, and Southeast
Asia.
Gross Profit.    Gross profit increased by $134.3 million, or 3.6%, to $3.886 billion in Fiscal 2019. Gross profit during Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018
reflected inventory charges of $7.2 million and $7.6 million, respectively, recorded in connection with our restructuring plans. The increase in gross profit
also included a net unfavorable foreign currency effect of $15.2 million. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 61.6% in Fiscal 2019
from 60.7% in Fiscal 2018. The 90 basis point increase was primarily driven by improved pricing and lower levels of promotional activity in connection
with our long-term growth strategy, and favorable product and geographic mix, partially offset by higher inventory reserves.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.    SG&A expenses increased by $72.8 million, or 2.4%, to $3.168 billion in Fiscal 2019. This
increase included a net favorable foreign currency effect of $17.4 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased slightly to 50.2% in
Fiscal 2019 from 50.1% in Fiscal 2018. The 10 basis point increase was primarily due to our increased marketing investment, new store expansion, and the
unfavorable impact attributable to geographic and channel mix, as a greater portion of our revenue was generated by our retail businesses (which typically
carry higher operating expense margins). These increases were partially offset by our operational discipline.

Impairment of Assets.   During Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $21.2 million and $41.2 million,
respectively, to write-down certain long-lived assets related to our restructuring plans and identification of underperforming stores. Additionally, as a result
of our decision to sell our corporate jet, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $4.6 million during Fiscal 2019 to reduce the carrying value of the
asset held-for-sale to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. During Fiscal 2018, we also recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $8.8 million to
reduce the carrying value of a certain intangible asset to its estimated fair value as a result of a change in the planned usage of the asset. See Note 8 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Restructuring and Other Charges.   During Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, we recorded restructuring charges of $93.6 million and $79.2 million,
respectively, in connection with our restructuring plans, primarily consisting of severance and benefits costs, and lease termination and store closure costs.
In addition, during Fiscal 2019, we recorded other charges of $36.5 million primarily related to our sabbatical leave program initiated during the fourth
quarter of Fiscal 2019, depreciation expense associated with our former Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City, and a customs audit. During
Fiscal 2018, we recorded other net charges of $28.8 million primarily related to depreciation expense associated with our former Polo store at 711 Fifth
Avenue in New York City, a customs audit, the departure of Mr. Stefan Larsson, and the reversal of reserves associated with the settlement of certain non-
income tax issues. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Operating Income.    Operating income increased by $63.6 million, or 12.8%, to $561.8 million in Fiscal 2019. Our operating results during Fiscal
2019 and Fiscal 2018 were negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges totaling $163.1 million
and $165.6 million, respectively, as previously discussed. Foreign currency effects did not have a meaningful impact on operating income during Fiscal
2019. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues increased to 8.9% in Fiscal 2019 from 8.1% in Fiscal 2018. The 80 basis point increase was
primarily driven by the increase in our gross profit margin, partially offset by the slight increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, all as
previously discussed.

North America operating margin improved by 30 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impact of 50 basis points related to our wholesale
business, largely driven by a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues and an increase in our gross profit margin. Partially offsetting this
increase was 20 basis points attributable to unfavorable channel mix.
Europe operating margin improved by 90 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impacts of 80 basis points related to foreign currency effects
and 60 basis points related to our retail business, largely driven by an increase in our gross profit margin. The increase in operating margin also reflected a
favorable impact of 10 basis points related to channel mix. Partially offsetting these increases in our operating margin was a 40 basis point unfavorable
impact related to higher non-cash charges recorded in connection with our restructuring plans during Fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year, as
well as a 20 basis point decline related to our wholesale business, largely driven by a decrease in our gross profit margin, partially offset by a decline in
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues.
Asia operating margin improved by 80 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impacts of 50 basis points related to our wholesale business and
30 basis points related to our retail business, both largely driven by a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by a
decrease in our gross profit margin.
Unallocated corporate expenses decreased by $9.4 million to $663.4 million in Fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower impairment of asset charges of
$14.8 million and lower compensation-related expenses of $8.4 million, partially offset by higher consulting fees of $6.1 million, higher marketing and
advertising expenses of $5.1 million, and higher other expenses of $2.6 million.
Unallocated restructuring and other charges increased by $22.1 million to $130.1 million in Fiscal 2019, as previously discussed above and in Note
9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Non-operating Income (Expense), Net.    During Fiscal 2019, we reported non-operating income, net, of $20.7 million, as compared to non-operating
expense, net, of $9.0 million in Fiscal 2018. The $29.7 million improvement was primarily driven by higher interest income of $28.5 million due to the
increased balance of our investment portfolio, as well as a favorable shift to higher interest rate environments attributable to cash repatriations from our
foreign subsidiaries.
Income Tax Provision.    The income tax provision and effective tax rate in Fiscal 2019 were $151.6 million and 26.0%, respectively, as compared to
$326.4 million and 66.7%, respectively, in Fiscal 2018. The $174.8 million decline in the income tax provision was primarily due to lower TCJA
enactment-related charges recorded during Fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by the increase in pretax income. During Fiscal
2019 and Fiscal 2018, we recorded TCJA enactment-related charges of $27.6 million and $221.4 million, respectively, which increased our effective tax
rates by 470 basis points and 4,520 basis points, respectively. In addition to this 4,050 basis point improvement attributable to lower TCJA enactment-
related charges recorded, the decline in our effective tax rate also reflected the net favorable impact of 20 basis points due to other factors, including a net
favorable change related to compensation-related adjustments, partially offset by the tax impact of the change in geographic

mix of our worldwide earnings. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the TCJA.
Net Income.    Net income increased to $430.9 million in Fiscal 2019, from $162.8 million in Fiscal 2018. The $268.1 million increase in net income
was primarily due to the decrease in our income tax provision and the increases in operating income and interest income, all as previously discussed. Net
income during Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 reflected TCJA enactment-related charges of $27.6 million and $221.4 million, respectively, as previously
discussed. Our operating results during Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 were also negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets,
and certain other charges totaling $163.1 million and $165.6 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $129.0 million
and $113.3 million, respectively.
Net Income per Diluted Share.    Net income per diluted share increased to $5.27 in Fiscal 2019, from $1.97 in Fiscal 2018. The $3.30 per share
increase was due to the higher level of net income, as previously discussed, and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during Fiscal 2019
driven by our share repurchases during the last twelve months. Net income per diluted share in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 were negatively impacted by
$0.34 per share and $2.68 per share, respectively, as a result of TCJA enactment-related charges. Net income per diluted share in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal
2018 were also negatively impacted by $1.58 per share and $1.38 per share, respectively, as a result of restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets,
and certain other charges, as previously discussed.

(b) See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the carrying values of our debt.
(c) "Net cash and investments" is defined as cash and cash equivalents, plus short-term and non-current investments, less total debt.
The decrease in our net cash and investments position at March 28, 2020 as compared to March 30, 2019 was primarily due to our use of cash to
support Class A common stock repurchases of $694.8 million, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation
awards, to invest in our business through $270.3 million in capital expenditures, and to make dividend payments of $203.9 million, partially offset by our
operating cash flows of $754.6 million.
The decrease in equity was primarily attributable to our share repurchase activity, dividends declared, and cumulative adjustments from our adoption
of new accounting standards, partially offset by our comprehensive income and the impact of stock-based compensation arrangements during Fiscal 2020.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.    Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $754.6 million during Fiscal 2020, from $783.8
million during Fiscal 2019. The $29.2 million net decline in cash provided by operating activities was due to a decrease in net income before non-cash
charges, partially offset by a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior
fiscal year. The net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, was primarily driven by:
•
a favorable change related to our inventories, largely driven by higher inventory charges primarily related to adverse impacts associated with
COVID-19 business disruptions;
•
a favorable change related to our prepaid expenses and other current assets, largely driven by the timing of cash payments; and
•
a favorable change related to our accounts receivable, largely driven by lower wholesale sales during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 as
compared to the prior fiscal year driven by COVID-19 business disruptions, as well as the timing of cash receipts.
These increases related to our operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by:
•
an unfavorable change related to our income tax receivables and payables, largely as a result of the absence of charges recorded during the
prior fiscal year in connection with the TCJA's mandatory transition tax; and
•
an unfavorable change related to our accrued liabilities driven by larger decreases in our bonus accrual and restructuring reserves as compared
to the prior fiscal year, as well as the timing of cash payments.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities.    Net cash provided by investing activities was $702.1 million during Fiscal 2020, as compared
to net cash used in investing activities of $879.3 million during Fiscal 2019. The $1.581 billion net increase in cash provided by investing activities was
primarily driven by:
•
a $1.624 billion increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, less purchases of investments. During Fiscal 2020, we received
net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $950.7 million, as compared to making net investment purchases of $673.3 million
during Fiscal 2019; and
•
a $23.8 million decrease in payments made to settle net investment hedges.
These increases in cash provided by investing activities were partially offset by:
•
a $72.6 million increase in capital expenditures. During Fiscal 2020, we spent $270.3 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $197.7
million during Fiscal 2019. Our capital expenditures during Fiscal 2020 primarily related to new store openings, retail and department store
renovations, enhancements to our information technology systems, and the consolidation of our corporate office footprint.

================================================================================
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are temporarily postponing non-critical capital expenditures as a preemptive action to preserve cash and
strengthen our liquidity. However, we remain committed to expanding and renovating our global store fleet and investing in our digital ecosystem.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.    Net cash used in financing activities was $438.2 million during Fiscal 2020, as compared to $605.7 million
during Fiscal 2019. The $167.5 million net decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by:
•
a $386.8 million increase in cash proceeds from the issuance of debt, less debt repayments. During Fiscal 2020, we borrowed $475.0 million
under the Global Credit Facility as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
During Fiscal 2019, we received $398.1 million in proceeds from our issuance of 3.750% unsecured senior notes in August 2018, a portion of
which was used to repay $300.0 million of our 2.125% unsecured senior notes that matured in September 2018. Additionally, during Fiscal
2019 we repaid approximately $10 million that had been borrowed under our credit facilities during Fiscal 2018.
This decrease in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by:
•
a $192.2 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. During Fiscal 2020, we used $650.3 million to
repurchase shares of Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $44.5 million in shares of
Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our
long-term stock incentive plans. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2019, $470.0 million in shares of Class A common stock were
repurchased and $32.6 million in shares of Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes;
•
a $21.8 million decrease in proceeds from exercise of stock options; and
•
a $13.2 million increase in payments of dividends, driven by an increase to the quarterly cash dividend per share (as discussed within
"Dividends" below). Dividends paid amounted to $203.9 million and $190.7 million during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.    Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $783.8 million during Fiscal 2019, from $975.1
million during Fiscal 2018. The $191.3 million net decline in cash provided by operating activities was due to a net unfavorable change related to our
operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by an increase in net income before non-
cash charges. The net unfavorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, was primarily driven by:
•
a year-over-year increase in our inventory levels largely to support revenue growth, as well as the timing of inventory receipts;
•
an unfavorable change related to our income tax payable, largely a result of the decrease in charges recorded in connection with the TCJA's
mandatory transition tax as compared to the prior fiscal year;
•
an unfavorable change related to accrued expenses and other current liabilities largely driven by fluctuations associated with our derivative
instruments; and

receipts and payments, respectively.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities.    Net cash used in investing activities was $879.3 million during Fiscal 2019, as compared to $189.1 million
during Fiscal 2018. The $690.2 million net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by:
•
a $650.4 million increase in purchases of investments, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. During Fiscal 2019, we made
net investment purchases of $673.3 million, as compared to $22.9 million during Fiscal 2018;
•
a $36.1 million increase in capital expenditures. During Fiscal 2019, we spent $197.7 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $161.6
million during Fiscal 2018. Our capital expenditures during Fiscal 2019 primarily related to new store openings, retail and department store
renovations, and enhancements to our information technology systems; and
•
a $23.8 million increase in payments made to settle net investment hedges.
These increases in cash used in investing activities were partially offset by cash proceeds of $20.0 million from the sale of one of our distribution
centers in North America during Fiscal 2019.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities.    Net cash used in financing activities was $605.7 million during Fiscal 2019, as compared to $197.5 million
during Fiscal 2018. The $408.2 million net increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by:
•
a $485.5 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. During Fiscal 2019, we used $470.0 million to
repurchase shares of Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $32.6 million in shares of
Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our
long-term stock incentive plans. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2018, no shares of Class A common stock were repurchased and $17.1
million in shares of Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes; and
•
a $28.3 million increase in payments of dividends, driven by an increase to the quarterly cash dividend per share. Dividends paid amounted to
$190.7 million and $162.4 million during Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively.
These increases in cash used in financing activities were partially offset by:
•
a $78.1 million increase in cash proceeds from the issuance of debt, less debt repayments. During Fiscal 2019, we received $398.1 million in
proceeds from our issuance of 3.750% unsecured senior notes in August 2018, a portion of which was used to repay $300.0 million of our
2.125% unsecured senior notes that matured in September 2018. Additionally, during Fiscal 2019 we repaid approximately $10 million that
had been borrowed under our credit facilities during Fiscal 2018; and
•
a $21.7 million increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options.
Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations, our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments, availability under our credit facilities and commercial paper program, and other available financing options.
During Fiscal 2020, we generated $754.6 million of net cash flows from our operations. As of March 28, 2020, we had $2.116 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, of which $587.9 million were held by our subsidiaries domiciled outside the U.S. We are not dependent on foreign
cash to fund our domestic operations. Undistributed foreign earnings that were subject to the TCJA's one-time mandatory transition tax as of December 31,
2017 are not considered to be permanently reinvested and may be repatriated to the U.S. in the future with minimal or no additional U.S. taxation. We
intend to permanently reinvest undistributed foreign earnings generated after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time mandatory transition
tax. However, if our plans change and we choose to repatriate post-2017 earnings to the U.S. in the future, we would be subject to applicable U.S. and
foreign taxes.

(a) As defined in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
(b) Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Global Credit Facility. Accordingly, we do not expect combined
borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Global Credit Facility to exceed $500 million.
(c) Includes $9.0 million of outstanding letters of credit for which we were contingently liable under the Global Credit Facility as of March 28,
2020.
We believe that the Global Credit Facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentration in any one financial institution. In particular, as of
March 28, 2020, there were eight financial institutions participating in the Global Credit Facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum
commitment percentage in excess of 20%. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we have the ability to expand our borrowing availability under
the Global Credit Facility to $1 billion through the full term of the facility, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the
facility to increase their commitments. Further, in May 2020, we entered into a new credit facility with the same lenders that are parties to the Global Credit
Facility, which provides for an additional $500 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit and matures on May 25, 2021, or earlier in the event we
are able to obtain other additional financing, as described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Borrowings under the Pan-Asia Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the participating
regional branches of JPMorgan Chase (the "Banks"), subject to availability of the Banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. We have
no reason to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the
Global Credit Facility and the Pan-Asia Credit Facilities in the event of our election to draw additional funds in the foreseeable future.
Our sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, global retail store and digital
commerce expansion, construction and renovation of shop-within-shops, investment in infrastructure, including technology, acquisitions, joint ventures,
payment of dividends, debt repayments, Class A common stock repurchases, settlement of contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions), and
other corporate activities, including our restructuring actions. We believe that our existing sources of cash, the availability under our credit facilities, and
our ability to access capital markets will be sufficient to support our operating, capital, and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, the ongoing
development of our businesses, and our plans for further business expansion. However, prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business
disruptions in any of our key regions, or a combination thereof, such as our recent temporary store closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, could impede
our ability to pay our obligations as they become due or return value to our shareholders, as well as delay previously planned expenditures related to our
operations.
See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our credit facilities.
Debt and Covenant Compliance
In August 2015, we completed a registered public debt offering and issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due
August 18, 2020, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.625%, payable semi-annually (the "2.625% Senior Notes"). In August 2018, we completed another
registered public debt offering and issued an additional $400 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due September 15, 2025, which
bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.750%, payable semi-annually (the "3.750% Senior Notes").

[PAGE 65 OF 401]
================================================================================
The indenture and supplemental indentures governing the 2.625% Senior Notes and 3.750% Senior Notes (as supplemented, the "Indenture") contain
certain covenants that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or
merge with another party; or sell, lease, or convey all or substantially all of our property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does not contain
any financial covenants.
We have a credit facility that provides for a $500 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit through August 12, 2024, also used to support the
issuance of letters of credit and the maintenance of the Commercial Paper Program (the "Global Credit Facility"). Borrowings under the Global Credit
Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and Japanese Yen. We have the ability to expand
the borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $1 billion, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility
to increase their commitments. Further, in May 2020, we entered into a new credit facility with the same lenders that are parties to the Global Credit
Facility, which provides for an additional $500 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on May 25, 2021, or earlier in the event we
are able to obtain other additional financing, as described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. There are no mandatory
reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility.
In March 2020, we borrowed $475.0 million under the Global Credit Facility as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These borrowings have been classified as short-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet as of March 28, 2020.
We were also contingently liable for $9.0 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in remaining availability under the Global Credit Facility of
$16.0 million as of March 28, 2020.
The Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants, as described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of
March 28, 2020, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility) has occurred under our Global Credit Facility. The
Pan-Asia Credit Facilities do not contain any financial covenants.
See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our debt and covenant compliance.
Common Stock Repurchase Program
On May 13, 2019, our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our existing common stock repurchase program that allowed us to repurchase up
to an additional $600 million of Class A common stock. As of March 28, 2020, the remaining availability under our Class A common stock repurchase
program was approximately $580 million. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions.
Accordingly, as a result of current business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended our common stock repurchase
program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity.
See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our Class A common stock repurchase
program.
Dividends
Since 2003, we have maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on our common stock. On May 13, 2019, our Board of Directors
approved an increase to the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.625 to $0.6875 per share.
As a result of current business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended our quarterly cash dividend program
as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion
of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, and other factors that the Board of Directors
may deem relevant, including economic and market conditions.
See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our quarterly cash dividend program.

The following is a description of our material, firmly committed obligations as of March 28, 2020:
•
Senior Notes represent the principal amount of our outstanding 2.625% Senior Notes and 3.750% Senior Notes. Amounts do not include any
fair value adjustments, call premiums, unamortized debt issuance costs, or interest payments (see below);
•
Borrowings under credit facilities represents the principal amount outstanding under our Global Credit Facility. Amounts do not include any
fair value adjustments, call premiums, unamortized debt issuance costs, or interest payments (see below);
•
Interest payments on debt represent the semi-annual contractual interest payments due on our 2.625% Senior Notes and 3.750% Senior Notes
and the interest payments due on the borrowings under our Global Credit Facility. Amounts do not include the impact of potential cash flows
underlying our related swap contracts (see Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our swap
contracts);
•
Lease obligations represent fixed payments due over the lease term of our noncancelable leases of real estate and operating equipment,
including rent, real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance fees, and/or certain other costs. For lease terms that have commenced,
information has been presented separately for operating and finance leases. Other lease commitments relate to executed lease agreements for
which the related lease terms have not yet commenced;
•
Inventory purchase commitments represent our legally-binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable
prices;
•
Mandatory transition tax payments represent our remaining tax obligation incurred in connection with the deemed repatriation of previously
deferred foreign earnings pursuant to the TCJA (see Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the
TCJA); and
•
Other commitments primarily represent our legally-binding obligations under sponsorship, licensing, and other marketing and advertising
agreements; information technology-related service agreements; and pension-related obligations.

================================================================================
[PAGE 67 OF 401]
================================================================================
Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $88.9 million as of March 28,
2020, as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. The above table also excludes the following: (i) other
than lease obligations and mandatory transition tax payments, amounts recorded in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of March 28,
2020, which will be paid within one year; and (ii) non-current liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them (e.g., deferred income), or the
cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do not represent a "purchase obligation" as the term is used herein (e.g., deferred taxes, derivative
financial instruments, and other miscellaneous items).
We also have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments if certain events or circumstances occur. See Note 15 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our contingent commitments not included in the above table.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In addition to the commitments included in the above table, our other off-balance sheet firm commitments relating to our outstanding letters of credit
amounted to $9.0 million as of March 28, 2020. We do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations, or other
relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements.
MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
As discussed in Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including the impact of changes
in currency exchange rates on foreign currency-denominated balances, certain anticipated cash flows of our international operations, and the value of
reported net assets of our foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations relating to fluctuations in benchmark
interest rates. Accordingly, in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage such risks, including the use of
derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Given our use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual
obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, it is our policy to only enter into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon an
evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. Our established policies and procedures for
mitigating credit risk include ongoing review and assessment of the creditworthiness of our counterparties. We also enter into master netting arrangements
with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. As a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to undue
concentration of counterparty risk with respect to our derivative contracts as of March 28, 2020. However, we do have in aggregate $56.6 million of
derivative instruments in net asset positions with seven creditworthy financial institutions.
Foreign Currency Risk Management
We manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates using forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts.
Refer to Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the notional amounts and fair values of our outstanding forward
foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts, as well as the impact on earnings and other comprehensive income of such instruments for
the fiscal periods presented.
Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts
We enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an
entity's non-functional currency, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net assets into
U.S. Dollars. As part of our overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the Japanese Yen,
the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi, we generally
hedge a portion of our related exposures anticipated over the next twelve months using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with maturities of two
months to one year to provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure.
Our foreign exchange risk management activities are governed by established policies and procedures. These policies and procedures provide a
framework that allows for the management of currency exposures while ensuring the activities are conducted within our established guidelines. Our
policies include guidelines for the organizational structure of our risk management function and for internal controls over foreign exchange risk
management activities, including, but not limited to, authorization levels,
66
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 68 OF 401]
================================================================================
transaction limits, and credit quality controls, as well as various measurements for monitoring compliance. We monitor foreign exchange risk using
different techniques, including periodic review of market values and performance of sensitivity analyses.
Our forward foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent such contracts are
designated as qualifying cash flow hedges of inventory transactions, related gains or losses are initially deferred in equity as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income ("AOCI") and are subsequently recognized within cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations when the
related inventory is sold.
Cross-Currency Swap Contracts
During our fiscal year ended April 2, 2016 ("Fiscal 2016"), we entered into two pay-floating rate, receive-floating rate cross-currency swaps with
notional amounts of €280 million and €274 million which we designated as hedges of our net investment in certain of our European subsidiaries. The €280
million notional cross-currency swap, which was settled during the second quarter of Fiscal 2019, swapped the U.S. Dollar-denominated variable interest
rate payments based on the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a fixed spread (as paid under the 2.125% Interest Rate Swap
discussed below) for Euro-denominated variable interest rate payments based on the 3-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR") plus a fixed
spread, which, in combination with the 2.125% Interest Rate Swap, economically converted our previously-outstanding $300 million fixed-rate 2.125%
Senior Notes obligation to a €280 million floating-rate Euro-denominated obligation. Similarly, the €274 million notional cross-currency swap, which
matures on August 18, 2020, swaps the U.S. Dollar-denominated variable interest rate payments based on the 3-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread (as paid
under the 2.625% Interest Rate Swap discussed below) for Euro-denominated variable interest rate payments based on the 3-month EURIBOR plus a fixed
spread, which, in combination with the 2.625% Interest Rate Swap, economically converts our $300 million fixed-rate 2.625% Senior Notes obligation to a
€274 million floating-rate Euro-denominated obligation.
Additionally, in August 2018, we entered into pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of
€346 million which we designated as hedges of our net investment in certain of our European subsidiaries. These contracts, which mature on September 15,
2025, swap the U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed interest rate payments on our 3.750% Senior Notes for Euro-denominated 1.29% fixed interest rate
payments, thereby economically converting our $400 million fixed-rate 3.750% Senior Notes obligation to a €346 million fixed-rate 1.29% Euro-
denominated obligation.
Sensitivity
We perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our forward foreign currency
exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. In doing so, we assess the risk of loss in the fair values of these contracts that would result from hypothetical
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by the foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. Dollar.
As of March 28, 2020, a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies under contract would result in a net increase or
decrease, respectively, in the fair value of our derivative portfolio of approximately $123 million. This hypothetical net change in fair value should
ultimately be largely offset by the net change in fair values of the underlying hedged items.
Interest Rate Risk Management
During Fiscal 2016, we entered into two pay-floating rate, receive-fixed rate interest rate swap contracts which we designated as hedges against
changes in the respective fair values of our previously-outstanding fixed-rate 2.125% Senior Notes and our fixed-rate 2.625% Senior Notes attributed to
changes in a benchmark interest rate. The interest rate swap related to the 2.125% Senior Notes (the "2.125% Interest Rate Swap"), which matured on
September 26, 2018 concurrent with the maturity of the related debt, had a notional amount of $300 million and swapped the fixed interest rate on the
2.125% Senior Notes for a variable interest rate based on 3-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread. The interest rate swap related to the 2.625% Senior Notes
(the "2.625% Interest Rate Swap"), which matures on August 18, 2020 and also has a notional amount of $300 million, swaps the fixed interest rate on the
2.625% Senior Notes for a variable interest rate based on 3-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread.
Sensitivity
As of March 28, 2020, we had no variable-rate debt outstanding. As such, our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily relates to changes in the
fair values of our fixed-rate Senior Notes. As of March 28, 2020, the aggregate fair values of our Senior Notes were $714.9 million. A 25-basis point
increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase, respectively, the aggregate fair values of our Senior Notes by approximately $5 million
based on certain simplifying assumptions, including an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other
subsequent changes for the remainder
67
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 69 OF 401]
================================================================================
of the period. Such potential increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt would only be realized if we were to retire all or a portion of the debt prior
to its maturity.
Investment Risk Management
As of March 28, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents on-hand of $1.620 billion, consisting of deposits in interest bearing accounts, investments
in money market deposit accounts, and investments in time deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less. Our other significant investments included
$495.9 million of short-term investments, consisting of investments in time deposits and commercial paper with original maturities greater than 90 days;
and $9.4 million of restricted cash held in escrow with certain banks as collateral, primarily to secure guarantees in connection with certain international tax
matters and real estate leases.
We actively monitor our exposure to changes in the fair value of our global investment portfolio in accordance with our established policies and
procedures, which include monitoring both general and issuer-specific economic conditions, as discussed in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. Our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit
risk, and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy. See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for further detail of the composition of our investment portfolio as of March 28, 2020.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and requires
significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, assessments of
probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other
professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated
amounts. We believe that the following list represents our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies,
including our critical accounting policies, see Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Sales Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts
A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income involves estimating sales reserves, which represent the portion of gross
revenues not expected to be realized. In particular, revenue related to our wholesale business is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season
markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances. Revenue related to our retail business, including digital commerce
sales, is also reduced by an estimate of returns.
In determining estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and cooperative advertising allowances, we
analyze historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, current economic and market conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases,
contractual terms. Estimates for operational chargebacks are based on actual customer notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and historical trends.
We review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis. Our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. However,
unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions, such as those resulting from disease pandemics and other catastrophic events, could result in
our actual results differing materially from our estimates. A hypothetical 1% increase in our reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns,
operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances as of March 28, 2020 would have decreased our Fiscal 2020 net revenues by
approximately $2 million.
Similarly, we evaluate our accounts receivable balances to determine if they will ultimately be collected. Significant judgments and estimates are
involved in this evaluation, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts (including consideration of their
financial condition and ability to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions), a receivables aging analysis that determines the percentage
of receivables that has historically been uncollected by aged category, and current economic and market conditions. Based on this information, we provide
a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for those risks as part of our bad
debt reserve, a severe and prolonged adverse impact on our major customers' business operations, such as those resulting from business disruptions caused
by disease pandemics and other catastrophic events, could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales, cash flows, and/or financial
condition. A hypothetical 1% increase in the level of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 28, 2020 would have increased our Fiscal 2020
SG&A expenses by approximately $1 million.
See "Accounts Receivable" in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our sales reserves and
allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal years presented.
68
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 70 OF 401]
================================================================================
Inventories
We hold inventory that is sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores. We also hold retail
inventory that is sold in our own stores and digital commerce sites directly to consumers. Substantially all of our inventories are comprised of finished
goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted-average cost basis.
The estimated net realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual product lines, the
impact of market trends and economic conditions, and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current orders in-house for future
sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell inventory through our factory stores, among other liquidation channels. Actual results may differ from estimates
due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences, and economic and market conditions. Reserves for
inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical
inventory counts. Our historical estimates of these costs and the related provisions have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen
adverse future economic and market conditions, such as those resulting from disease pandemics and other catastrophic events, could result in our actual
results differing materially from our estimates.
A hypothetical 1% increase in the level of our inventory reserves as of March 28, 2020 would have decreased our Fiscal 2020 gross profit by
approximately $3 million.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and,
along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying
values may not be fully recoverable.
We generally perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that
the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. However, in order to reassess the fair values of our reporting units, we
periodically perform a quantitative impairment analysis in lieu of using the qualitative approach.
Performance of the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment requires judgment in identifying and considering the significance of relevant key
factors, events, and circumstances that affect the fair values of our reporting units. This requires consideration and assessment of external factors such as
macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as our actual and planned financial performance. We also give
consideration to the difference between each reporting unit's fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date that a fair value measurement was
performed. If the results of the qualitative assessment conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying
value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed.
The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair
value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not to be impaired. However, if the carrying value of a
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Any impairment charge recognized is limited to the
amount of the respective reporting unit's allocated goodwill.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires judgment and often involves the use of
significant estimates and assumptions, including an assessment of external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as
entity-specific factors, such as actual and planned financial performance. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used when determining the fair values of
other indefinite-lived intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is
recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. To assist management in the process of determining any potential goodwill impairment, we may review
and consider appraisals from accredited independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market
comparisons, and recent transactions. These approaches involve significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including
timing), discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in those future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, and selection of appropriate market comparable
metrics and transactions.

================================================================================
[PAGE 71 OF 401]
================================================================================
We performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2020 using the qualitative approach
discussed above, while giving consideration to our then-most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test (the results of which indicated that the fair
values of our reporting units with allocated goodwill significantly exceeded their respective carrying values). Based on the results of the qualitative
impairment assessment performed, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values of these reporting units significantly exceeded their
respective carrying values and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment.
Subsequent to performing our Fiscal 2020 annual goodwill impairment assessment, we determined that indicators of impairment were present during
the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 as a result of adverse business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary closure of our
stores in North America, Europe, and Asia. As a result, we performed an interim assessment of the recoverability of goodwill assigned to our reporting
units using a quantitative approach as of March 28, 2020. The estimated fair values of our reporting units were determined with the assistance of an
independent third-party valuation firm using discounted cash flows and market comparisons. Based on the results of the quantitative impairment
assessment, we concluded that the fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and were not at risk of
impairment. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded during any of the fiscal years presented. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements for further discussion.
In evaluating finite-lived intangible assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition where probable. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its
carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external
market participant assumptions.
During Fiscal 2018, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $8.8 million as a result of a change in the planned usage of a certain intangible
asset to reduce the value of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value. There were no other finite-lived intangible asset impairment charges recorded
during any of the fiscal periods presented. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
It is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for
example, (i) our businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in future years vary from current assumptions, (iii) business
conditions or strategies change from our current assumptions, or (iv) the identification of our reporting units change, among other factors. Such changes
could result in a future impairment charge of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.
Impairment of Other Long-Lived Assets
Property and equipment and lease-related right-of-use ("ROU") assets, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets for
recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (including any potential sublease income for lease-
related ROU assets) and its eventual disposition, where applicable. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset
are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value,
considering external market participant assumptions. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal (commonly referred to as
assets held-for-sale) are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.
In determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost
controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local
advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, future impairments may arise in the event that future cash
flows do not meet expectations. For example, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions, such as those resulting from disease pandemics
and other catastrophic events, could negatively impact consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences and result in actual results
differing from our estimates. Additionally, we may review and consider appraisals from accredited independent valuation firms to determine the fair value
of long-lived assets, where applicable.
During Fiscal 2020, Fiscal 2019, and Fiscal 2018, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $38.7 million, $21.2 million, and $41.2 million,
respectively, to write-down the carrying values of certain long-lived assets based upon their assumed fair values. Additionally, during Fiscal 2019, we
recorded a non-cash charge of $4.6 million to reduce the carrying value of a certain asset held-for-sale to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. See Note
8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Income Taxes
In determining our income tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If we consider that a tax
position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the tax benefit. We
measure the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position
is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and require
significant judgment, and we often obtain assistance from external advisors. To the extent that our estimates change or the final tax outcome of these
matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made.
If the initial assessment of a position fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we will recognize the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or
analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) the statute of
limitations expires; or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency.
Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating losses, capital losses, general business credit carryforwards, and the net tax
effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under
enacted tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a
deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income,
which typically involves the use of significant estimates. Such allowances are adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments
to those balances.
See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes.
Contingencies
We are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including certain litigation, alleged
information system security breaches, contractual disputes, employee relation matters, various tax or other governmental audits, and trademark and
intellectual property matters and disputes. We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the
related losses are estimable. In addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability,
we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, if practicable. Management considers many factors in
making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex
judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and governmental actions. As a result, the
accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on management's judgment in developing the related estimates and assumptions.
Stock-Based Compensation
We expense all stock-based compensation awarded to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over
the requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures which are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and expected future trends.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")
We have granted restricted shares of our Class A common stock to our non-employee directors and grant service-based RSUs to certain of our senior
executives and other employees, as well as to our non-employee directors. In addition, we grant RSUs with performance-based and market-based vesting
conditions to such senior executives and other key employees.
The fair values of our restricted stock, service-based RSU, and performance-based RSU awards are measured based on the fair value of our Class A
common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while
outstanding and unvested. Related compensation expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized over the employees' requisite service period, to the
extent that our attainment of performance goals (upon which vesting is dependent) is deemed probable, and involves judgment as to expectations
surrounding our achievement of certain defined operating performance metrics.
71
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 73 OF 401]
================================================================================
The fair value of our market-based RSU awards, for which vesting is dependent upon total shareholder return ("TSR") of our Class A common stock
over a three-year performance period relative to that of a pre-established peer group, is measured on the grant date based on estimated projections of our
relative TSR over the performance period. These estimates are made using a Monte Carlo simulation, which models multiple stock price paths of our Class
A common stock and that of the peer group to evaluate and determine our ultimate expected relative TSR performance ranking. Related compensation
expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied. See Note 18 to
the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Stock Options
Stock options have been granted to employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our Class A
common stock on the date of grant. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options, which requires the
use of both subjective and objective assumptions. Certain key assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the
estimation process include the expected term of the option, expected volatility of our stock price, our expected dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate,
among others. Generally, once stock option values are determined, accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are
different from actual results.
No stock options were granted during any of the fiscal years presented. See Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for
further discussion.
Sensitivity
The assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair values of our stock-based compensation awards represent our best estimates. In addition,
projecting the achievement level of certain performance-based awards, as well as estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited, requires
judgment. If actual results or forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions, or if assumptions used to estimate the grant date fair value
of future stock-based award grants are significantly changed, stock-based compensation expense and, therefore, our results of operations could be
materially impacted. A hypothetical 10% change in our Fiscal 2020 stock-based compensation expense would have affected net income by approximately
$9 million.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

[PAGE 74 OF 401]
================================================================================
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the
reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial
officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have
concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level, as of the fiscal year-end covered by this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Securities Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Internal control over financial
reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the
Company's assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial
statements would be prevented or detected. Further, the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as of a specific
date, and continued effectiveness in future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the
degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may decline.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report based on the framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based
on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal controls over financial reporting were effective at the reasonable assurance level as
of the fiscal year-end covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control
over financial reporting as included elsewhere herein.
(c) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
Except as discussed below, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
In addition to the changes discussed below, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic,
including periods of closure of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities beginning during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, as described
within "Recent Developments." In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken various preemptive actions to preserve cash and strengthen our
liquidity, including temporarily furloughing and/or reducing work hours for a significant portion of both our store and corporate employees, with those
corporate employees not furloughed in affected regions working remotely. Despite such actions, we have not experienced any material changes to our
internal controls over financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate and monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our internal controls. See
Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business"
for additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Leases
In connection with our adoption of ASU 2016-02 as of the beginning of the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, changes were made to certain lease-related
processes and control activities, including information systems, in order to monitor and maintain appropriate controls over financial reporting. We will
continue to evaluate and monitor our internal controls as our lease-related processes and procedures evolve. See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements for additional discussion regarding our adoption of ASU 2016-02.
Implementation and Reconfiguration of Financial Reporting Systems
In connection with our initiative to integrate and upgrade our global systems and processes, we migrated our Asia operations to a new financial
reporting information technology system, Microsoft AX Dynamics 365, in Fiscal 2020. In addition to this system implementation, during Fiscal 2020, we
began reconfiguring the financial reporting information technology system used by our Europe operations, SAP, in order to utilize enhanced financial
reporting functionality.
As a result of these actions, we expect to experience certain changes to our processes and procedures which, in turn, will result in changes to our
internal control over financial reporting. While we expect these system changes to strengthen our internal financial controls by automating certain manual
processes and standardizing business processes and reporting across our organization, management will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal
controls as processes and procedures in each of the affected areas evolve. For a discussion of risks related to the implementation of new systems, see
Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively."

Description of Business
Ralph Lauren Corporation ("RLC") is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel,
footwear, accessories, home furnishings, fragrances, and hospitality. RLC's long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across an
expanding number of products, brands, sales channels, and international markets. RLC's brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection,
Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Polo Ralph Lauren, Double RL, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, Chaps, and Club Monaco, among others.
RLC and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the "Company," "we," "us," "our," and "ourselves," unless the context indicates otherwise.
The Company diversifies its business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail,
wholesale, and licensing). This allows the Company to maintain a dynamic balance as its operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any
single geographic area or channel of distribution. The Company sells directly to consumers through its integrated retail channel, which includes its retail
stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. The Company's wholesale sales are made principally to
major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which the
Company has licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using its trademarks. In addition, the Company licenses to third parties for
specified periods the right to access its various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain
apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.
The Company organizes its business into the following three reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to these reportable
segments, the Company also has other non-reportable segments. See Note 20 for further discussion of the Company's segment reporting structure.

Basis of Presentation
Basis of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP")
and present the consolidated financial position, income, comprehensive income, and cash flows of the Company, including all entities in which the
Company has a controlling financial interest and is determined to be the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
Fiscal Year
The Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. As such, fiscal year 2020 ended on March 28, 2020 and
was a 52-week period ("Fiscal 2020"); fiscal year 2019 ended on March 30, 2019 and was a 52-week period ("Fiscal 2019"); fiscal year 2018 ended on
March 31, 2018 and was a 52-week period ("Fiscal 2018"); and fiscal year 2021 will end on March 27, 2021 and will be a 52-week period ("Fiscal 2021").
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes thereto. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include reserves for bad debt, customer returns, discounts,
end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances; the realizability of inventory; reserves for litigation
and other contingencies; useful lives and impairments of long-lived tangible and intangible assets; fair value measurements; accounting for income taxes
and related uncertain tax positions; valuation of stock-based compensation awards and related forfeiture rates; reserves for restructuring activity; and
accounting for business combinations, among others.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods' financial information in order to conform to the current period's presentation, including
a change to the Company's segment reporting structure as further described in Note 20.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue across all channels of the business when it satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of
promised products or services to its customers, which occurs either at a point in time or over time, depending on when the customer obtains the ability to
direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services. The amount of revenue recognized considers terms of
sale that create variability in the amount of consideration that the Company ultimately expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products or services, and
is subject to an overall constraint that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. Sales and other related taxes collected from customers
and remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenue.
Revenue from the Company's retail business is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of the products, which occurs either at the
point of sale for merchandise purchased at the Company's retail stores and concession-based shop-within-shops, or upon receipt of shipment for
merchandise ordered through direct-to-consumer digital commerce sites. Such revenues are recorded net of estimated returns based on historical trends.
Payment is due at the point of sale.
Gift cards issued to customers by the Company are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized. The
Company also estimates and recognizes revenue for gift card balances not expected to ever be redeemed (referred to as "breakage") to the extent that it
does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. Such
estimates are based upon historical redemption trends, with breakage income recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual customer redemptions.
Revenue from the Company's wholesale business is generally recognized upon shipment of products, at which point title passes and risk of loss is
transferred to the customer. In certain arrangements where the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment, revenue is recognized upon receipt of
products by the customer. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and
certain cooperative advertising allowances. Returns and allowances require pre-approval from management and discounts are based on trade terms.
Estimates for end-of-season markdown reserves are based on historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic and
market conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms. Estimates for operational chargebacks are based on actual customer
notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and historical trends. The Company reviews and refines these estimates on at least a quarterly basis. The
Company's historical estimates of these amounts have not differed materially from actual results.
Revenue from the Company's licensing arrangements is recognized over time during the period that licensees are provided access to the Company's
trademarks (i.e., symbolic intellectual property) and benefit from such access through their sales of licensed products. These arrangements require licensees
to pay a sales-based royalty, which for most arrangements may be subject to a contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Payments are generally
due quarterly and, depending on time of receipt, may be recorded as a liability until recognized as revenue. The Company recognizes revenue for sales-
based royalty arrangements (including those for which the royalty exceeds any contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount) as licensed products are
sold by the licensee. If a sales-based royalty is not ultimately expected to exceed a contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount, the minimum is
recognized as revenue ratably over the contractual period. This sales-based output measure of progress and pattern of recognition best represents the value
transferred to the licensee over the term of the arrangement, as well as the amount of consideration that the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for
providing access to its trademarks. As of March 28, 2020, contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amounts expected to be recognized as revenue during
future periods were as follows:

Deferred Income
Deferred income represents cash payments received in advance of the Company's transfer of control of products or services to its customers and is
generally comprised of unredeemed gift cards, net of breakage, and advance royalty payments from licensees. The Company's deferred income balances
were $14.6 million and $14.8 million as of March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively, and were primarily recorded within accrued expenses and
other current liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. During Fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $9.3 million of net revenues from amounts
recorded as deferred income as of March 30, 2019. The majority of the deferred income balance as of March 28, 2020 is expected to be recognized as
revenue within the next twelve months.
Cost of Goods Sold and Selling Expenses
Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight-in, and import costs, as
well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability. Gains and losses associated with forward foreign currency exchange contracts that are
designated as qualifying cash flow hedges of inventory transactions are also recognized within cost of goods sold when the hedged inventory is sold. The
costs of selling merchandise, including those associated with preparing merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing, and order charges
("handling costs"), are included in selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Costs associated with shipping goods to customers are accounted for as fulfillment activities and reflected as a component of SG&A expenses in the
consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and handling costs (described above) billed to customers are included in revenue. A summary of shipping
and handling costs is as follows:

Advertising and Marketing Costs
Advertising costs, including the costs to produce advertising, are expensed when the advertisement is first exhibited. Advertising costs paid to
wholesale customers under cooperative advertising programs are not included in advertising costs, but rather are reflected as a reduction of revenue since
generally the benefits are not sufficiently separable from the purchases of the Company's products by customers. Costs associated with the marketing and
promotion of the Company's products are included within SG&A expenses.
Advertising and marketing expenses were $278.0 million, $272.8 million, and $241.1 million in Fiscal 2020, Fiscal 2019, and Fiscal 2018,
respectively. Deferred advertising, marketing, and promotional costs, which principally relate to advertisements that have not yet been exhibited or services
that have not yet been received, were $10.1 million and $9.6 million at the end of Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively, and were recorded within
prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
The financial position and operating results of the Company's foreign operations are accounted for in their respective functional currencies, which
are primarily consistent with the local currency. For purposes of consolidation, local currency assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. Dollars at the rates
of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. Dollars at average rates of exchange in
effect during the period. The resulting translation gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a component of
other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI") and in the consolidated statements of equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI").
Gains and losses on the translation of intercompany loans made to foreign subsidiaries that are of a long-term investment nature are also included within
this component of equity.

================================================================================
RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
The Company also recognizes gains and losses on both third-party and intercompany balances that are denominated in a currency other than the
respective entity's functional currency. Such foreign currency transactional gains and losses are recognized within other income (expense), net in the
consolidated statements of operations, inclusive of the effects of any related hedging activities, and reflected net losses of $1.1 million and $2.8 million in
Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively, and net gains of $4.5 million in Fiscal 2018.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income, which is reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of equity, consists
of net income and certain other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from net income and referred to as OCI. Components
of OCI consist of foreign currency translation gains (losses); net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, such as forward foreign
currency exchange contracts; net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments; and net realized and unrealized gains (losses)
related to the Company's defined benefit plans.
Net Income per Common Share
Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shares by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Weighted-average common shares include shares of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock. Diluted net
income per common share adjusts basic net income per common share for the dilutive effects of outstanding restricted stock units ("RSUs"), stock options,
and any other potentially dilutive instruments, only in the periods in which such effects are dilutive.
The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic net income per common share is reconciled to shares used to
calculate diluted net income per common share as follows:

Diluted shares

All earnings per share amounts have been calculated using unrounded numbers. The Company has outstanding performance-based and market-based
RSUs, which are included in the computation of diluted shares only to the extent that the underlying performance or market conditions (i) have been
satisfied as of the end of the reporting period or (ii) would be considered satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency
period and the result would be dilutive. In addition, options to purchase shares of the Company's Class A common stock at an exercise price greater than
the average market price of the common stock during the reporting period are anti-dilutive and therefore not included in the computation of diluted net
income per common share. As of the end of Fiscal 2020, Fiscal 2019, and Fiscal 2018, there were 0.8 million, 1.4 million, and 2.0 million, respectively, of
additional shares issuable contingent on vesting of performance-based RSUs and upon exercise of anti-dilutive options, that were excluded from the diluted
shares calculations.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant
date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures which are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and
expected future trends. The grant date fair value of the Company's market-based RSU awards, for which vesting is dependent upon total shareholder return
("TSR") of its Class A common stock over a three-year performance period relative to that of a pre-established peer group, is estimated using a Monte
Carlo simulation model. The grant date fair values of restricted stock awards, service-based RSUs, and performance-based RSUs are determined based on
the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend
equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the grant date fair
value of any stock option awards. Compensation expense for all performance-based RSUs is recognized over the requisite service period when attainment
of the performance goal is deemed

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
probable, net of estimated forfeitures. Compensation expense for market-based RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the requisite service
period regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied. The Company recognizes compensation expense on an
accelerated basis for all awards with graded vesting terms, including restricted stock, certain RSUs, and stock options. For RSU awards with cliff vesting
terms, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis. For certain RSU awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who
will become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, the related stock-based compensation expense is
recognized on an accelerated basis over a term commensurate with the period that the employee is required to provide service in order to vest in the award.
See Note 18 for further discussion of the Company's stock-based compensation plans.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less, including investments in time deposits
and debt securities. Investments in debt securities are diversified across high-credit quality issuers in accordance with the Company's risk-management
policies.
Restricted Cash
The Company is periodically required to place cash in escrow with various banks as collateral, primarily to secure guarantees of corresponding
amounts made by the banks to international tax authorities on behalf of the Company, such as to secure refunds of value-added tax payments in certain
international tax jurisdictions or in the case of certain international tax audits, as well as to secure guarantees related to certain real estate leases. Such cash
is classified as restricted cash and reported as a component of either prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets in the Company's
consolidated balance sheets.
Investments
The Company's investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit
risk, and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in the Company's investment policy.
Short-term investments consist of investments which the Company expects to convert into cash within one year, including time deposits and debt
securities, which have original maturities greater than 90 days. Non-current investments, which are classified within other non-current assets in the
consolidated balance sheets, consist of those investments which the Company does not expect to convert into cash within one year.
The Company classifies all of its investments at the time of purchase as available-for-sale. These investments are recorded at fair value with
unrealized gains or losses classified as a component of AOCI in the consolidated balance sheets, and related realized gains or losses recorded within
income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. Cash inflows and outflows related to the sale and purchase of investments are classified
as investing activities in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows.
Equity-method Investments
Investment ownership interests that provide the Company with significant influence, but less than a controlling interest, over an investee are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Significant influence is generally presumed to exist when the Company owns between 20% and 50%
of the investee.
Under the equity method of accounting, the following amounts are generally recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements: the
Company's original investment, as subsequently adjusted for its share of the investee's earnings (losses) and reduced by any dividends received and other-
than-temporary impairments recorded, is included in the consolidated balance sheets; the Company's share of the investee's periodic earnings (losses) is
included in the consolidated statements of operations; and dividends and other cash distributions received from the investee and additional cash
investments made in or other cash paid to the investee are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
The Company's share of equity-method investee earnings and losses is recognized within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements
of operations, and reflected net gains of $0.1 million and $2.9 million in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively, and net losses of $4.5 million in Fiscal
2018.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Impairment Assessment
The Company evaluates its investments that are in unrealized loss positions, if any, and equity method investments for other-than-temporary
impairment on a quarterly basis (see Note 12). Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of the risks and uncertainties
associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers or investees. Factors considered by the Company include
(i) the length of time and the extent to which an investment's fair value has been below its cost; (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness, and near-term
prospects of the issuer; (iii) the length of time to maturity; (iv) future economic conditions and market forecasts; (v) the Company's intent and ability to
retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value; (vi) an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the
Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery of market value; and (vii) whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
investment's carrying amount might not be recoverable. See Note 13 for further information relating to the Company's investments.
During Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a $7.1 million impairment charge within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of
operations relating to an equity method investment (see Note 8).
Accounts Receivable
In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to wholesale customers that satisfy defined credit criteria. Payment is generally due
within 30 to 120 days and does not include a significant financing component. Accounts receivable is recorded at carrying value, which approximates fair
value, and is presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets net of certain reserves and allowances. These reserves and allowances consist of
(i) reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances (see the "Revenue
Recognition" section above for further discussion of related accounting policies) and (ii) allowances for doubtful accounts.
A rollforward of the activity in the Company's reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain
cooperative advertising allowances is presented below:

adverse economic conditions, and evaluation of the impact of other economic and market conditions, among other factors. The Company's estimated
allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 28, 2020 reflects adverse impacts associated with COVID-19 business disruptions, which include temporary
department and specialty store closures worldwide, as well as declines in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items.

Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company sells its wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the
world, and extends credit based on an evaluation of each customer's financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. In the Company's
wholesale business, concentration of credit risk is relatively limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic
areas. However, the Company has three key wholesale customers that generate significant sales volume. During Fiscal 2020, the Company's sales to its
three largest wholesale customers accounted for approximately 18% of total net revenues. Substantially all of the Company's sales to its three largest
wholesale customers related to its North America segment. As of March 28, 2020, these three key wholesale customers constituted approximately 32% of
total gross accounts receivable.
Inventories
The Company holds inventory that is sold in its retail stores and digital commerce sites directly to consumers. The Company also holds inventory
that is sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners. Substantially all of the
Company's inventories consist of finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted-
average cost basis.
The estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of the Company's individual product lines,
the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current in-house orders for
future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell inventory through the Company's factory stores, among other liquidation channels. Actual results may
differ from estimates due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences, and actual economic and market
conditions. In addition, reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience
and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. The Company's historical estimates of the realizable value of its inventory and its reserves for
inventory shrinkage have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions, such as those
resulting from disease pandemics and other catastrophic events, could result in the Company's actual results differing materially from its estimates.
The Company's estimated realizable value of its inventory as of March 28, 2020 reflects adverse impacts associated with COVID-19 business
disruptions, which include temporary closures of the Company's stores and those of its wholesale customers worldwide, as well as declines in retail traffic,
tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based upon the
estimated useful lives of depreciable assets, which range from three to seven years for furniture and fixtures, machinery and equipment, and capitalized
software; and from ten to forty years for buildings and improvements. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful
lives of the respective assets or the term of the related lease.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable (see Note 12). In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, including finite-
lived intangibles as described below, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual
disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is
recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions. Assets
to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan for disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.
Leases
As discussed in Note 4, the Company adopted a new lease accounting standard as of the beginning of Fiscal 2020.
The Company's lease arrangements primarily relate to real estate, including its retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, corporate offices,
and warehouse facilities, and to a lesser extent, certain equipment and other assets. The Company's leases generally have initial terms ranging from three to
fifteen years and may include renewal or early-termination options, rent escalation clauses, and/or lease incentives in the form of construction allowances
and rent abatements. Renewal rent payment terms generally reflect market rates prevailing at the time of renewal. The Company is typically required to
make fixed minimum rent payments, variable rent payments based on performance (e.g., percentage-of-sales-based payments), or a combination thereof,
directly related to its right to use an underlying leased asset. The Company is also often required to pay for certain other costs that do not relate specifically
to its right to use an underlying leased asset, but that are associated with the asset, including real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance fees,
and/or certain other costs (referred to collectively herein as "non-lease components"), which may be fixed or variable in amount, depending on the terms of
the respective lease agreement. The Company's leases do not contain significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.
The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at the arrangement's inception. If a lease is determined to exist, its related term is
assessed at lease commencement, once the underlying asset is made available by the lessor for the Company's use. The Company's assessment of the lease
term reflects the non-cancellable period of the lease, inclusive of any rent-free periods and/or periods covered by early-termination options for which the
Company is not considered reasonably certain of exercising, as well as periods covered by renewal options for which it is considered reasonably certain of
exercising. The Company also determines lease classification as either operating or finance (formerly referred to as "capital") at lease commencement,
which governs the pattern of expense recognition and the presentation thereof reflected in the consolidated statements of operations over the lease term.
For leases with a lease term exceeding 12 months, a lease liability is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at lease commencement
reflecting the present value of its fixed payment obligations over such term. A corresponding right-of-use ("ROU") asset equal to the initial lease liability is
also recorded, increased by any prepaid rent and/or initial direct costs incurred in connection with execution of the lease, and reduced by any lease
incentives received. The Company includes fixed payment obligations related to non-lease components in the measurement of ROU assets and lease
liabilities, as it elects to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component. Variable lease payments are not included in the
measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets associated with finance leases are presented separate from those associated with operating
leases, and are included within property and equipment, net on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. For purposes of measuring the present value of
its fixed payment obligations for a given lease, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, determined based on information available at lease
commencement, as rates implicit in its leasing arrangements are not readily determinable. The Company's incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate it
would pay to borrow on a secured basis an amount equal to the lease payments and incorporates the term and economic environment of the lease.
For operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as operating lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the
initial ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term, along with recognition of interest expense associated with accretion of the lease
liability, which is ultimately reduced by the related fixed payments as they are made. For leases with a lease term of 12 months or less (referred to as a
"short-term lease"), any fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over such term and are not recognized on the consolidated balance
sheet. Variable lease cost, if any, is recognized as incurred for all leases.
ROU assets, along with any other related long-lived assets, are periodically evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that
their carrying values may not be fully recoverable (see Note 12). To the extent that an ROU asset and any related long-lived assets are determined to be
impaired, they are written down accordingly on a relative carrying amount basis,
F-15

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
with the ROU asset written down to an amount no lower than its estimated fair value. Subsequent to the recognition of any such impairment, total
remaining lease cost is recognized on a front-loaded basis over the remaining lease term.
See Note 14 for further discussion of the Company's leases.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
At acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which typically consist of reacquired license
agreements, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and/or order backlog. The fair values of these intangible assets are estimated based on
management's assessment, considering independent third-party appraisals when necessary. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of
net assets acquired, both tangible and intangible, is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful
lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. The Company generally
performs its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analyses using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely
than not that the fair values of such assets are less than their respective carrying values. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is concluded
that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the asset exceeds its carrying value, a quantitative test is performed. Under the quantitative test, if the
carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess. The Company also periodically performs a
quantitative test to assess its goodwill for impairment in lieu of using the qualitative approach in order to reassess the fair values of its reporting units.
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets as noted above, are
evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable.
See discussion of the Company's accounting policy for long-lived asset impairment as previously described under the caption "Property and Equipment,
Net."
Income Taxes
Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current taxes
payable/refunds receivable, and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the results of any
difference between U.S. GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating losses, capital losses, general
business credit carryforwards, and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement
and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in
the period of enactment.
In addition, valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred
tax asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur or circumstances change that warrant
adjustments.
In determining the income tax benefit (provision) for financial reporting purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If
the Company considers that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, it
recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon
settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These
assessments can be complex and the Company often obtains assistance from external advisors. To the extent that the Company's estimates change or the
final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax benefit (provision) in the period in
which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, the Company regularly monitors its position
and subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on
the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a
settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the Company expects to pay cash within
the next twelve months. Interest and penalties are recorded within the income tax benefit (provision) in the Company's consolidated statements of
operations and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets together with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
See Note 10 for further discussion of the Company's income taxes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company records derivative financial instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting are either (i) offset through earnings against the changes in fair value of the related hedged
assets, liabilities, or firm commitments or (ii) recognized in equity as a component of AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, depending on
whether the instrument is hedging against changes in fair value or cash flows and net investments, respectively.
Each derivative instrument that qualifies for hedge accounting is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the risk associated with the related
exposure. For each instrument that is designated as a hedge, the Company documents the related risk management objective and strategy, including
identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, and the risk exposure, as well as how hedge effectiveness will be assessed over the instrument's
term. To assess hedge effectiveness at the inception of a hedging relationship, the Company generally uses regression analysis, a statistical method, to
compare changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument to changes in the fair value or cash flows of the related hedged item. The extent to which a
hedging instrument has been and is expected to remain highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows is assessed by the
Company on at least a quarterly basis.
Given its use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual
obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions
based upon an evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. The Company's established
policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk from derivative transactions include ongoing review and assessment of its counterparties'
creditworthiness. The Company also enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. In the event
of default or termination (as such terms are defined within the respective master netting arrangement), these arrangements allow the Company to net-settle
amounts payable and receivable related to multiple derivative transactions with the same counterparty. The master netting arrangements specify a number
of events of default and termination, including the failure to make timely payments.
The fair values of the Company's derivative instruments are recorded on its consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. For cash flow reporting
purposes, proceeds received or amounts paid upon the settlement of a derivative instrument are classified in the same manner as the related item being
hedged, primarily within cash flows from operating activities.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate its risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions
made in an entity's non-functional currency. To the extent designated as cash flow hedges, related gains or losses on such instruments are initially deferred
in equity as a component of AOCI and are subsequently recognized within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations when the related
inventory is sold.
If a derivative instrument is dedesignated or if hedge accounting is discontinued because the instrument is not expected to be highly effective in
hedging the designated exposure, any further gains (losses) are recognized in earnings each period within other income (expense), net. Upon
discontinuance of hedge accounting, the cumulative change in fair value of the derivative instrument recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the
related hedged item affects earnings, consistent with the hedging strategy, unless the related forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring, in which
case the accumulated amount is immediately recognized in earnings within other income (expense), net.
Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations
The Company periodically uses cross-currency swap contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce risk associated with
exchange rate fluctuations on certain of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Changes in the fair values of such derivative instruments that are
designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in equity as a component of AOCI in the same manner as foreign currency
translation adjustments. In assessing the effectiveness of such hedges, the Company uses a method based on changes in spot rates to measure the impact of
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on both its foreign subsidiary net investment and the related hedging instrument. Under this method, changes in
the fair value of the hedging instrument other than those due to changes in the spot rate are initially recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are
amortized into earnings as interest expense using a systematic and rational method over the instrument's term. Changes in fair value associated with the
effective portion (i.e., those due to changes in the spot rate) are recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are released and recognized in earnings
only upon the sale or liquidation of the hedged net investment.

Fair Value Hedges
Changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument that is designated as a fair value hedge, along with offsetting changes in the fair value of the
related hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings. To the extent that the change in the fair value of the hedged item does not fully
offset the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument, the resulting net impact is reflected in earnings within the income statement line item
associated with the hedged item.
Undesignated Hedges
The Company uses undesignated hedges primarily to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk related to third-party and intercompany balances and
exposures. Changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments are recognized in earnings each period within other income (expense), net.
See Note 13 for further discussion of the Company's derivative financial instruments.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Implementation Costs in Cloud Computing Arrangements
In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2018-15, "Customer's
Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract" ("ASU 2018-15"). ASU 2018-15 addresses
diversity in practice surrounding the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing hosting arrangement that is a service contract by
establishing a model for capitalizing or expensing such costs, depending on their nature and the stage of the implementation project during which they are
incurred. Any capitalized costs are to be amortized over the reasonably certain term of the hosting arrangement and presented in the same line within the
statement of operations as the related service arrangement's fees. ASU 2018-15 also requires enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures surrounding
hosting arrangements that are service contracts. ASU 2018-15 is effective for the Company beginning in its Fiscal 2021, with early adoption permitted, and
may be adopted on either a retrospective or prospective basis. Other than the new disclosure requirements, the Company does not currently expect that the
adoption of ASU 2018-15 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, "Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income"
("ASU 2018-02"). Existing accounting guidance requires the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a change in tax laws or
rates to be included in net income, including the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to items recorded within AOCI. ASU 2018-02 provides an entity
with the option to adjust AOCI for the "stranded" tax effect of such remeasurements resulting from the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax
rate under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") through a reclassification to retained earnings.
The Company adopted ASU 2018-02 as of the beginning of the first quarter of Fiscal 2020 and elected to reclassify the income tax effect stranded in
AOCI related to the TCJA, inclusive of state income tax-related effects, resulting in a $4.9 million increase to its opening retained earnings. The
Company generally releases income tax effects from AOCI when the corresponding pretax AOCI items are reclassified to earnings.
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" ("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13,
which was further updated and clarified by the FASB through issuance of additional related ASUs, amends the guidance surrounding measurement and
recognition of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including trade receivables and investments in certain debt securities, by
requiring upfront recognition of an allowance for credit losses expected to be incurred over an asset's lifetime based on relevant information about past
events, current conditions, and supportable forecasts impacting its ultimate collectibility. It is expected that application of this "expected loss" model will
result in earlier recognition of credit losses than the current "as incurred" model, under which losses are recognized only upon occurrence of an event that
gives rise to the incurrence of a probable loss. While the Company's historical bad debt write-off activity has generally been insignificant, similar to current
practice, the extent of losses ultimately recognized will depend on prevailing
F-18

================================================================================
RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
conditions and ongoing consideration of information and forecasts that inform assessments of collectability. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company
beginning in its Fiscal 2021, with early adoption permitted, and is to be adopted on a modified retrospective basis.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases." ASU No. 2016-02, along with certain other ASUs that were subsequently issued
to clarify and modify certain of its provisions (collectively "ASU 2016-02"), supersedes historical lease accounting guidance and requires that, among its
provisions, a lessee's rights and fixed payment obligations under most leases be recognized as ROU assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet, initially
measured based on the present value of its fixed payment obligations over the lease term. Under historical guidance, only those leases classified as capital
were recognized on a lessee's balance sheet; operating leases were not recognized on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 retains a dual model for classifying
leases as either finance (formerly referred to as "capital") or operating, consistent with historical guidance, which governs the pattern of expense
recognition reflected in the statement of operations over the lease term. Accordingly, recognition of lease expense in the statement of operations will not
significantly change. Additionally, variable lease payments based on performance, such as percentage-of-sales-based payments, are not included in the
measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities and, consistent with historical practice, are recognized as an expense in the period incurred. The standard
also requires enhanced quantitative and qualitative lease-related disclosures.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 as of the beginning of the first quarter of Fiscal 2020 using a modified retrospective approach under which
the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard was recognized as an adjustment to its opening retained earnings (discussed further below), with no
restatement of prior year amounts. In connection therewith, the Company applied an optional package of practical expedients intended to ease transition to
the standard for existing leases by, among its provisions, carrying forward its original lease classification conclusions without reassessment. Upon adoption
of ASU 2016-02, the Company recognized initial ROU asset and lease liability balances of approximately $1.60 billion and $1.75 billion, respectively, on
its consolidated balance sheet.
Additionally, in connection with its adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company recorded an adjustment to reduce its opening retained earnings
balance by $131.6 million, net of related income tax benefits, reflecting the impairment of an ROU asset for a certain real estate lease of which, under
historical accounting guidance, the Company was previously deemed the owner for accounting purposes (commonly referred to as a "build-to-suit" lease
arrangement). Specifically, although the Company no longer generates revenue or other cash flows from its rights underlying the leased asset given it no
longer actively uses the space for commercial purposes, the asset was previously not considered impaired under historical accounting guidance as its fair
value, assessed from an ownership perspective (and not from that of a lessee), exceeded its carrying value. However, in accordance with and upon
transitioning to ASU 2016-02, the Company derecognized the remaining asset and liability balances previously recognized solely as a result of the
arrangement's build-to-suit designation, as the related construction activities that originally gave rise to such designation have since ended, and established
initial ROU asset and lease liability balances measured based on the Company's remaining fixed payment obligations under the lease. The initial ROU asset
was then assessed for impairment based on the aggregate estimated cash flows that could be generated by transferring the lease to a market participant
sublessee for the remainder of its term, which were lower than the aggregate remaining lease payments underlying the measurement of the initial ROU
asset. Accordingly, the Company impaired the initial ROU asset by $175.4 million to its estimated fair value which was recorded as a reduction to its
opening retained earnings balance, net of related income tax benefits of $43.8 million, upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, as previously noted.
The Company also recorded other initial ROU asset impairments to reduce its opening retained earnings balance upon adoption of the standard
related to leases of certain underperforming retail locations for which the carrying value of the respective store's initial operating lease ROU asset exceeded
its fair value. These impairments totaled $49.7 million and were recorded as adjustments to reduce the Company's opening retained earnings balance by
$37.8 million, net of related income tax effects. Leasehold improvements related to these underperforming retail locations were previously fully-impaired
prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02.
See Notes 3 and 14 for further discussion of the Company's lease accounting policy and other related disclosures.

Impairment of Assets
During Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $31.6 million to write-down certain long-lived assets, of which $8.7
million was recorded in connection with its restructuring plans (see Note 9) and $22.9 million of which related to underperforming stores identified through
its on-going store portfolio evaluation and adverse impacts associated with COVID-19 business disruptions. These charges were recorded within
impairment of assets in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the Company recorded a $7.1 million impairment charge within other income
(expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations during Fiscal 2020 relating to an equity method investment.
During Fiscal 2019, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $21.2 million to write-down certain long-lived assets, of which $10.7
million was recorded in connection with its restructuring plans (see Note 9) and $10.5 million of which related to underperforming stores identified as a
result of its on-going store portfolio evaluation. Additionally, as a result of its decision to sell its corporate jet in connection with its cost savings initiative,
the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $4.6 million during Fiscal 2019 to reduce the carrying value of the asset held-for-sale to its
estimated fair value, less costs to sell.
During Fiscal 2018, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $41.2 million, to write-down certain long-lived assets, of which $16.0
million was recorded in connection with its restructuring plans (see Note 9) and $25.2 million of which related to underperforming stores identified as a
result of its on-going store portfolio evaluation. Additionally, as a result of a

Restructuring and Other Charges
A description of significant restructuring and other activities and their related costs is included below.
Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan
On June 4, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan associated with the Company's strategic objective of operating
with discipline to drive sustainable growth (the "Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan"). The Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan includes the following restructuring-
related activities: (i) rightsizing and consolidation of the Company's global distribution network and corporate offices; (ii) targeted severance-related
actions; and (iii) closure of certain of its stores and shop-within-shops.
Actions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan are complete and no additional charges are expected to be incurred in connection with
this plan. A summary of the charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan during the fiscal periods presented, as well as the
cumulative charges recorded since its inception, is as follows:

Way Forward Plan
On June 2, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan with the objective of delivering sustainable, profitable sales
growth and long-term value creation for shareholders (the "Way Forward Plan"). In connection with the Way Forward Plan, the Company refocused on its
core brands and its product, marketing, and shopping experience to increase desirability and relevance. It also evolved its operating model by significantly
improving quality of sales, reducing supply chain lead times, improving its sourcing, and executing a disciplined multi-channel distribution and expansion
strategy. The Company reduced its cost structure and implemented a return on investment-driven financial model to free up resources to invest in the brand
and drive high-quality sales. The Company also strengthened its leadership team and created a more nimble organization by moving from an average of
nine to six layers of management. The Way Forward Plan also included the discontinuance of the Company's Denim & Supply brand and the integration of
its denim product offerings into its Polo Ralph Lauren brand. Collectively, these actions, which were substantially completed during the Company's fiscal
year ended April 1, 2017 ("Fiscal 2017"), resulted in a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain stores and shop-within-shops.
On March 30, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved the following additional restructuring-related activities associated with the Way
Forward Plan: (i) the restructuring of its in-house global digital commerce platform which was in development and shifting to a more cost-effective,
flexible platform through a new agreement with Salesforce's Commerce Cloud, formerly known as Demandware; (ii) the closure of its Polo store at 711
Fifth Avenue in New York City; and (iii) the further streamlining of the organization and the execution of other key corporate actions. These additional
restructuring-related activities were largely completed during Fiscal 2018 and resulted in a further reduction in workforce and the closure of certain
corporate office and store locations.

(a) Includes $17.7 million of certain lease-related liabilities previously recognized in connection with the Company's closure and cessation of use of
real estate locations that were reclassified and reflected as reductions of the respective operating lease ROU assets initially recognized upon
adoption of ASU 2016-02 (see Note 4).
Other Restructuring Plans
The Company made cash payments of $0.2 million, $3.2 million, and $7.6 million during Fiscal 2020, Fiscal 2019, and Fiscal 2018, respectively,
which were applied against the reserve associated with its restructuring plan initiated prior to Fiscal 2017. Additionally, during Fiscal 2020, $1.2 million of
lease-related liabilities previously recognized in connection with the Company's closure and cessation of use of real estate locations were reclassified and
reflected as reductions of the respective operating lease ROU assets initially recognized upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 (see Note 4). As of March 28,
2020, there was no remaining restructuring reserve associated with this plan, and no charges were recorded for this plan in any of the fiscal years presented.
Other Charges
During Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded other charges of $20.8 million related to the donation of net cash proceeds received from the sale of its
corporate jet. This donation was made to the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation (formerly known as the Polo Ralph Lauren Foundation), a non-profit,
charitable foundation that supports various philanthropic programs. Additionally, during Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded other charges of $8.8 million
primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations for which the related lease agreements have not
yet expired.
During Fiscal 2019, the Company recorded other charges of $14.1 million related to depreciation expense associated with the Company's former
Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City, recorded after the store closed during the first quarter of Fiscal 2018. Additionally, during Fiscal 2019,
the Company recorded other charges of $4.2 million primarily related to a customs audit, as well as $18.2 million primarily related to the launch of its new
sabbatical leave program, which entitles eligible employees to periodic paid leave based on the attainment of certain employment tenure milestones. Other
than this initial charge to establish its estimated liability for services rendered to-date, the Company does not expect there will be a significant, ongoing
impact to the consolidated financial statements in future periods related to its sabbatical leave program.
During Fiscal 2018, the Company recorded other charges of $14.1 million related to depreciation expense associated with the Company's former
Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City, $10.2 million related to a customs audit, and $6.7 million (inclusive of accelerated stock-based
compensation expense of $2.1 million) primarily related to the departure of Mr. Stefan Larsson as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer
and as a member of its Board of Directors, effective as of May 1, 2017. Refer to the Form 8-K filed on February 2, 2017 for additional discussion regarding
the departure of Mr. Larsson. These other charges recorded in Fiscal 2018 were partially offset by the favorable impact of $2.2 million related to the
reversal of reserves associated with the settlement of certain non-income tax issues.

Income Taxes
Swiss Tax Reform
In May 2019, a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (the "Swiss Tax Act"),
which became effective January 1, 2020. The Swiss Tax Act eliminates certain preferential tax items at both the federal and cantonal levels for
multinational companies and provides the cantons with parameters for establishing local tax rates and regulations. The Swiss Tax Act also provides
transitional provisions, one of which allows eligible companies to increase the tax basis of certain assets based on the value generated by their business in
previous years, and to amortize such adjustment as a tax deduction over a transitional period.
During the second quarter of Fiscal 2020, the Swiss Tax Act was enacted into law, resulting in an immaterial adjustment associated with the
revaluation of the Company's Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities and estimated annual effective tax rate. Subsequently, as a result of additional
information received from the tax authorities and analyses performed related to the transitional provision noted above, the Company recorded a one-time
income tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset of $122.9 million during Fiscal 2020. This one-time benefit decreased the Company's effective tax
rate by 3,760 basis points during Fiscal 2020.

U.S. Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA"),
which became effective January 1, 2018. The TCJA significantly revised U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, lowering the U.S. federal statutory
income tax rate from 35% to 21%, creating a territorial tax system that includes a one-time mandatory transition tax on previously deferred foreign
earnings, and eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions.
ASC Topic 740, "Income Taxes," requires the effects of changes in tax laws to be recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted.
However, due to the complexity and significance of the TCJA's provisions, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") on
December 22, 2017, which allowed companies to record the tax effects of the TCJA on a provisional basis based on a reasonable estimate, and then, if
necessary, subsequently adjust such amounts during a limited measurement period as additional information became available and further analyses were
completed. The measurement period ends when a company has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, not to
extend beyond one year from enactment.
During the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, the Company recorded charges of $231.3 million within its income tax provision in connection with the
TCJA, of which $215.5 million related to the mandatory transition tax, and $15.8 million related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets
and liabilities. Subsequently, as a result of finalizing its full Fiscal 2018 operating results, the issuance of new interpretive guidance, and other analyses
performed, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, whereby it reversed $6.2 million of the
charges related to the mandatory transition tax and $5.5 million related to the revaluation of its deferred taxes. These reversals were partially offset by an
incremental charge of $1.8 million related to the expected future remittance of certain previously deferred foreign earnings. Collectively, these net charges
of $221.4 million, which were recorded on a provisional basis, increased the Company's effective tax rate by 4,520 basis points during Fiscal 2018.
During the second quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company recorded an additional measurement period adjustment as a result of the issuance of new
interpretive guidance related to stock-based compensation for certain executives, whereby it recorded an income tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax
asset of $4.7 million. Subsequently, during the third quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company completed its analyses and recorded its final measurement period
adjustments, whereby it recorded incremental charges of $32.3 million within its income tax provision, substantially all of which related to the mandatory
transition tax. These measurement period adjustments increased the Company's effective tax rate by 470 basis points during Fiscal 2019. Approximately
$241 million of the cumulative TCJA enactment-related charges recorded related to the mandatory transition tax (see Note 15).
Additionally, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 the Company reevaluated its permanent reinvestment assertion and determined that
undistributed foreign earnings that were subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax were no longer considered to be permanently reinvested, effective
December 31, 2017. The mandatory transition tax does not apply to undistributed foreign earnings generated after December 31, 2017, and therefore the
Company intends to permanently reinvest such earnings. See "Deferred Taxes" for additional discussion.
The Company also decided to account for the minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") in the period in which it is incurred
and therefore has not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2019.

21.0% by the TCJA effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended statutory rate of 31.5% for the Company's Fiscal 2018.
(b) Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the income tax benefit (provision) by income (loss) before income taxes.
The Company's Fiscal 2020 effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% primarily due to the one-time income
tax benefit recorded in connection with the Swiss Tax Act, as previously discussed, the favorable impact of the change in geographic mix of its worldwide
earnings and the favorable impact of tax benefits associated with provision to tax return adjustments, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of
additional income tax reserves associated with certain income tax audits. The Company's Fiscal 2019 effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal
statutory income tax rate of 21%

effective tax rate was higher than the blended statutory rate of 31.5% primarily due to the enactment-related charges recorded in connection with the TCJA,
as previously discussed, the negative impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" ("ASU
2016-09"), and the unfavorable impact of additional income tax reserves associated with certain income tax audits, partially offset by the favorable impact
of the proportion of earnings generated in lower taxed foreign jurisdictions versus the U.S. and tax benefits associated with adjustments recorded on
deferred tax assets and provision to tax return adjustments.

$67.0 million, respectively, recorded within deferred tax assets, and non-current deferred tax liabilities of $10.0 million and $50.2 million,
respectively, recorded within other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company has available state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $0.7 million and $5.9 million (both net of tax), respectively, for tax
purposes to offset future taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in Fiscal 2021.
The Company also has available state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $7.8 million and $28.1 million (both net of tax), respectively,
for which no net deferred tax asset has been recognized. A full valuation allowance has been recorded against these carryforwards since the Company does
not believe that it will more likely than not be able to utilize these carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Subsequent recognition of these deferred
tax assets would result in an income tax benefit in the year of such recognition. The valuation allowance relating to state net operating loss carryforwards
increased by $0.6 million (net of tax) as a result of net operating losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company does not believe that it will more likely
than not be able to utilize these carryforwards in the future. The valuation allowance relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards decreased by $1.1
million as a result of reductions in net operating losses in certain jurisdictions.

As a result of the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the TCJA, the Company reevaluated its permanent reinvestment
assertion and determined that undistributed foreign earnings that were subject to the TCJA's one-time mandatory transition tax were no longer considered
to be permanently reinvested, effective December 31, 2017. The mandatory transition tax does not apply to undistributed foreign earnings generated after
December 31, 2017. Accordingly, provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on approximately $924 million of undistributed earnings
of foreign subsidiaries generated after December 31, 2017, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested. These earnings could become
subject to tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings were lent to RLC, a subsidiary or a U.S. affiliate of RLC, or if the stock of the
subsidiaries were sold. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.

Future Changes in Unrecognized Tax Benefits
The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the Company's tax positions is subject to change based on future events including, but not
limited to, settlements of ongoing tax audits and assessments and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Although the outcomes and timing of
such events are highly uncertain, the Company does not anticipate that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, will
change significantly during the next twelve months. However, changes in the occurrence, expected outcomes, and timing of such events could cause the
Company's current estimate to change materially in the future.
The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as tax returns in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. The
Company is generally no longer subject to examinations by the relevant tax authorities for years prior to its fiscal year ended March 30, 2013.

respectively, associated with the Company's related interest rate swap contract (see Note 13). The carrying value of the 2.625% Senior Notes is
also presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount of $0.2 million and $0.7 million as of March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019,

(b) The carrying value of the 3.750% Senior Notes is presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount of $3.6 million and $4.3
million as of March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively.
Senior Notes
In August 2015, the Company completed a registered public debt offering and issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior
notes due August 18, 2020, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.625%, payable semi-annually (the "2.625% Senior Notes"). The 2.625% Senior Notes
were issued at a price equal to 99.795% of their principal amount. The proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate purposes.
In August 2018, the Company completed another registered public debt offering and issued an additional $400 million aggregate principal amount of
unsecured senior notes due September 15, 2025, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.750%, payable semi-annually (the "3.750% Senior Notes"). The
3.750% Senior Notes were issued at a price equal to 99.521% of their principal amount. The proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate
purposes, including repayment of the Company's previously outstanding $300 million principal amount of unsecured 2.125% senior notes that matured
September 26, 2018 (the "2.125% Senior Notes").
The Company has the option to redeem the 2.625% Senior Notes and 3.750% Senior Notes (collectively, the "Senior Notes"), in whole or in part, at
any time at a price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the series of Senior
Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present value of Remaining Scheduled Payments, as defined in the supplemental indentures governing such
Senior Notes (together with the indenture governing the Senior Notes, the "Indenture"). The Indenture contains certain covenants that restrict the
Company's ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge with another party;
or sell, lease,

or convey all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does not contain any financial covenants.
Commercial Paper
The Company has a commercial paper borrowing program that allows it to issue up to $500 million of unsecured commercial paper notes through
private placement using third-party broker-dealers (the "Commercial Paper Program").
Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Global Credit Facility, as defined below. Accordingly, the Company does not
expect combined borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and Global Credit Facility to exceed $500 million. Commercial Paper
Program borrowings may be used to support the Company's general working capital and corporate needs. Maturities of commercial paper notes vary, but
cannot exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. Commercial paper notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program rank equally with the Company's
other forms of unsecured indebtedness. As of March 28, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program.
Revolving Credit Facilities
Global Credit Facility
In August 2019, the Company replaced its existing credit facility and entered into a new credit facility that provides for a $500 million senior
unsecured revolving line of credit through August 12, 2024 (the "Global Credit Facility") under terms and conditions substantially similar to those of the
previous facility. The Global Credit Facility is also used to support the issuance of letters of credit and maintenance of the Commercial Paper Program.
Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and certain other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and
Japanese Yen, and are guaranteed by all of the Company's domestic significant subsidiaries. In accordance with the terms of the agreement governing the
Global Credit Facility, the Company has the ability to expand its borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $1 billion, subject to the
agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability
throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility.
In March 2020, the Company borrowed $475.0 million under the Global Credit Facility as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen its
liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This borrowing has been classified as short-term debt in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of
March 28, 2020. The Company was also contingently liable for $9.0 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in remaining availability under the
Global Credit Facility of $16.0 million as of March 28, 2020.
Under the Global Credit Facility as originally implemented, U.S. Dollar-denominated borrowings under the Global Credit Facility bear interest, at
the Company's option, either at (a) a base rate, by reference to the greatest of: (i) the annual prime commercial lending rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
in effect from time to time, (ii) the weighted-average overnight Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (iii) the one-month London Interbank Offered
Rate ("LIBOR") plus 100 basis points; or (b) LIBOR, adjusted for the Federal Reserve Board's Eurocurrency liabilities maximum reserve percentage, plus
a spread of 75 basis points, subject to adjustment based on the Company's credit ratings ("Adjusted LIBOR"). Foreign currency-denominated borrowings
bear interest at Adjusted LIBOR.
In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Global Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to
the lenders under the Global Credit Facility relating to the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate of 6.5 basis points is subject to adjustment
based on the Company's credit ratings. These provisions were amended in May 2020, as discussed below.
The Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company's ability, subject to specified exceptions, to
incur additional debt; incur liens; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are
not in a related line of business; make loans, advances, or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make certain investments. As originally
implemented, the Global Credit Facility also required the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR (the
"leverage ratio") of no greater than 4.25 as of the date of measurement for the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Adjusted Debt is defined
generally as consolidated debt outstanding, including finance lease obligations, plus all operating lease obligations. Consolidated EBITDAR is defined
generally as consolidated net income plus (i) income tax expense, (ii) net interest expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense, (iv) operating lease
cost, (v) restructuring and other non-recurring expenses, and (vi) acquisition-related

costs. This requirement was amended in May 2020, as discussed below. As of March 28, 2020, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the
Global Credit Facility) has occurred under the Company's Global Credit Facility.
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Global Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Global Credit
Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Global Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (many
of which are subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure to make timely principal, interest, and fee payments or to satisfy the
covenants, including the financial covenant described above. Additionally, the Global Credit Facility provides that an Event of Default will occur if
Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company's Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family fail to maintain a specified
minimum percentage of the voting power of the Company's common stock.
In May 2020, the Company entered into an amendment of its Global Credit Facility (the "Amendment"). Under the Amendment, until the earlier of
(a) the date on which the Company provides the periodic reporting information required under the Global Credit Facility for the quarter ending
September 30, 2021 and (b) the date on which the Company certifies that its leverage ratio as of the last day of the two most recent fiscal quarters was no
greater than 4.25 (the "Ratings-Based Toggle Date"), for loans based on Adjusted LIBOR, the spread over Adjusted LIBOR will be increased to 187.5 basis
points, the spread on loans based on the base rate will be 87.5 basis points and the commitment fee will be increased to 25 basis points, in each case with no
adjustments based on the Company's credit rating. The pricing will return to the original levels set forth in the Global Credit Facility on the Ratings-Based
Toggle Date. Additionally, the leverage ratio requirements have been waived until the quarter ending September 30, 2021. For that Fiscal Quarter the
maximum permitted leverage ratio would be 5.25 to 1.00. For the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2021 and the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022
the maximum would be 4.75 to 1.00. For each fiscal quarter ending on or after June 30, 2022, the leverage ratio test would return to 4.25 to 1.00. The
Amendment also (a) imposes a new requirement that would remain in effect until the Ratings-Based Toggle Date that the aggregate amount of unrestricted
cash of the Company and its subsidiaries plus the undrawn amounts available under the Global Credit Facility may not be less than $750 million, (b)
restricts the amount of dividends and distributions on, or purchases, redemptions, retirements or acquisitions of, the Company's stock until the Specified
Period Termination Date (as defined below), (c) until March 31, 2021, amends the material adverse change representation to disregard pandemic-related
impacts to the business and (d) until the Specified Period Termination Date, adds certain other restrictions on indebtedness incurred by the Company and its
subsidiaries and investments and acquisitions by the Company and its subsidiaries. The "Specified Period Termination Date" is the earlier of (i) the date on
which the Company provides the periodic reporting information required under the Global Credit Facility for the quarter ending June 30, 2022 and (ii) the
date on which the Company certifies that its leverage ratio as of the last day of the two most recent fiscal quarters was no greater than 4.25.
364 Day Facility
In May 2020, the Company entered into a new credit facility with the same lenders that are parties to the Global Credit Facility (the "364 Day
Facility"). The 364 Day Facility provides for a $500 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit and matures on May 25, 2021; provided that the
maturity date may be earlier if the Company issues senior notes other than to refinance the currently outstanding senior notes due in August 2020. The
terms of the 364 Day Facility are otherwise substantially similar to the terms of the Global Credit Facility as in effect until the Specified Period Termination
Date, including with respect to having the same borrowers and guarantors, including with respect to having the same borrowers and guarantors, except that
(a) no letters of credit may be issued under the 364 Day Facility, (b) the interest rate under the 364 Day Facility is 187.5 basis points above Adjusted
LIBOR or 87.5 basis points above the alternate base rate, and the commitment fee is 25 basis points per annum, in each case subject to adjustment based on
the Company's credit rating, (c) the 364 Day Facility contains provisions that limit borrowings if consolidated unrestricted cash and liquid investments of
the Company exceed $1 billion and (d) there is no leverage ratio requirement under the 364 Day Facility. Under the terms of the 364 Day Facility, if the
Company does not satisfy certain customary closing conditions by June 15, 2020 (which date will be extended to June 17, 2020 under certain
circumstances), the lenders' commitment to make loans will expire.
Pan-Asia Credit Facilities
Certain of the Company's subsidiaries in Asia have uncommitted credit facilities with regional branches of JPMorgan Chase (the "Banks") in China
and South Korea (the "Pan-Asia Credit Facilities"). These credit facilities are subject to annual renewal and may be used to fund general working capital
and corporate needs of the Company's operations in the respective countries. Borrowings under the Pan-Asia Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the parent
company and are granted at the sole discretion of the Banks, subject to availability of the Banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements.
The Pan-Asia Credit Facilities do not contain any financial covenants. The Company's Pan-Asia Credit Facilities by country are as follows:

Fair Value Measurements
U.S. GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The determination of the applicable level within
the hierarchy for a particular asset or liability depends on the inputs used in its valuation as of the measurement date, notably the extent to which the inputs
are market-based (observable) or internally-derived (unobservable). A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:
•
Level 1 — inputs to the valuation methodology based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•
Level 2 — inputs to the valuation methodology based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets for substantially the
full term of the financial instrument; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active for substantially the full
term of the financial instrument; and model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are observable.
•
Level 3 — inputs to the valuation methodology based on unobservable prices or valuation techniques that are significant to the fair value
measurement.
The following table summarizes the Company's financial assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis,
excluding accrued interest components:

million was included within cash and cash equivalents and $236.0 million was included within short-term investments in the consolidated
balance sheet.
The Company's investments in commercial paper are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets
using external pricing data, based on interest rates and credit ratings for similar issuances with the same remaining term as the Company's investments. To
the extent the Company invests in bonds, such investments are also classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance
sheets based on quoted prices in active markets.
The Company's derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets and are valued using pricing models that
are primarily based on market observable external inputs, including spot and forward currency exchange rates, benchmark interest rates, and discount rates
consistent with the instrument's tenor, and consider the impact of the Company's own credit risk, if any. Changes in counterparty credit risk are also
considered in the valuation of derivative financial instruments.
The Company's cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and time deposits are recorded at carrying value, which generally approximates fair value
based on Level 1 measurements.

The Company's debt instruments are recorded at their carrying values in its consolidated balance sheets, which may differ from their respective fair
values. The fair values of the Senior Notes are estimated based on external pricing data, including available quoted market prices, and with reference to
comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates, credit ratings, and trading frequency, among other factors. The fair values of the Company's
commercial paper notes and borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities, if any, are estimated using external pricing data, based on interest rates and
credit ratings for similar issuances with the same remaining term as the Company's outstanding borrowings. Due to their short-term nature, the fair values
of the Company's commercial paper notes and borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities, if any, generally approximate their carrying values.

Unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the Company's debt instruments do not result in the realization or expenditure
of cash, unless the debt is retired prior to its maturity.
Non-financial Assets and Liabilities
The Company's non-financial assets, which primarily consist of goodwill, other intangible assets, property and equipment, and lease-related ROU
assets, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and instead are reported at carrying value in its consolidated balance sheet.
However, on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be fully recoverable (and at least annually for
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets), the respective carrying value of non-financial assets are assessed for impairment and, if ultimately
considered impaired, are adjusted and written down to their fair value, as estimated based on consideration of external market participant assumptions.
During Fiscal 2020, Fiscal 2019, and Fiscal 2018, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of certain long-
lived assets to their estimated fair values. The fair values of these assets were determined based on Level 3 measurements, the related inputs of which
included estimates of the amount and timing of the assets' net future discounted cash flows (including any potential sublease income for lease-related ROU
assets), based on historical experience and consideration of current trends, market conditions, and comparable sales, as applicable.

carrying values of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values as of the assessment date:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
 
(a) Impairment of equity method investment is recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. All other
impairment charges are recorded within impairments of assets in the consolidated statements of operations, unless otherwise noted.
(b) Total impairment charges for Fiscal 2019 includes $4.6 million recorded to reduce the carrying value of the Company's held-for-sale corporate
jet to its estimated fair value less costs to sell of $20.8 million as of March 30, 2019. Balance was reclassified from property and equipment, net
to prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet upon being classified as an asset held-for-sale. The asset was
subsequently sold during Fiscal 2020 (see Note 7).
(c) Total impairment charges for Fiscal 2020 includes $225.1 million recorded in connection with the Company's adoption of ASC 2016-02 as of
the beginning of Fiscal 2020 which, net of related income tax benefits, reduced its opening retained earnings balance by $169.4 million (see
Note 4).
(d) Non-cash impairment charge recorded during Fiscal 2018 relates a change in the planned usage of a certain intangible asset.
See Note 8 for additional discussion regarding non-cash impairment charges recorded by the Company within the consolidated statements of
operations during the fiscal years presented.
No goodwill impairment charges were recorded during any of the fiscal years presented. In Fiscal 2020, the Company performed its annual goodwill
impairment assessment using a qualitative approach as of the beginning of the second quarter of the fiscal year. In performing the assessment, the Company
identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affected the fair values and/or carrying amounts of its
reporting units with allocated goodwill. These factors included external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-
specific factors, such as the Company's actual and expected financial performance. Additionally, the results of the Company's then-most recent quantitative
goodwill impairment test indicated that the fair values of these reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. Based on the results
of its qualitative goodwill impairment assessment, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are
less than their respective carrying values, and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment.
Subsequent to performing its Fiscal 2020 annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company determined that indicators of impairment were
present during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 as a result of adverse business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary
closure of its stores in North America, Europe, and Asia. As a result, the Company performed an interim assessment of the recoverability of goodwill
assigned to its reporting units using a quantitative approach as of March 28, 2020. The estimated fair values of the Company's reporting units were
determined with the assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm using discounted cash flows and market comparisons. Based on the results of
the quantitative impairment assessment, the Company concluded that the fair values of its reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying
values and were not at risk of impairment. Accordingly, no goodwill impairment charges were recorded.

Financial Instruments
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily relating to certain anticipated cash flows and the value of the
reported net assets of its international operations, as well as changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate debt obligations attributed to changes in a benchmark
interest rate. Accordingly, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage and mitigate such risks. The Company does not use derivatives for
speculative or trading purposes.

Risk Management Strategies
Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts
The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate its risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions
made in an entity's non-functional currency, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net
assets into U.S. dollars. As part of its overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the
Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi,
the Company generally hedges a portion of its related exposures anticipated over the next twelve months using forward foreign currency exchange
contracts with maturities of two months to one year to provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure.
Interest Rate Swap Contracts
During Fiscal 2016, the Company entered into two pay-floating rate, receive-fixed rate interest rate swap contracts which it designated as hedges
against changes in the respective fair values of its fixed-rate 2.125% Senior Notes and its fixed-rate 2.625% Senior Notes, attributed to changes in a
benchmark interest rate (the "Interest Rate Swaps"). The interest rate swap related to the 2.125% Senior Notes (the "2.125% Interest Rate Swap"), which
matured on September 26, 2018 concurrent with the maturity of the related debt, had a notional amount of $300 million and swapped the fixed interest rate
on the 2.125% Senior Notes for a variable interest rate based on the 3-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread. The interest rate swap related to the 2.625%
Senior Notes (the "2.625% Interest Rate Swap"), which matures on August 18, 2020 and also has a notional amount of $300 million, swaps the fixed
interest rate on the 2.625% Senior Notes for a variable interest rate based on 3-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread. Changes in the fair values of the Interest
Rate Swaps were offset by changes in the fair values of the 2.125% Senior Notes and 2.625% Senior Notes attributed to changes in the benchmark interest
rate, with no resulting net impact reflected in earnings during any of the fiscal years presented.
The following table summarizes the carrying values of the 2.625% Senior Notes and the impacts of the related fair value hedging adjustments as of

Cross-Currency Swap Contracts
During Fiscal 2016, the Company entered into two pay-floating rate, receive-floating rate cross-currency swap contracts with notional amounts of
€280 million and €274 million that were designated as hedges of its net investment in certain of its European subsidiaries. The €280 million notional cross-
currency swap, which was settled during the second quarter of Fiscal 2019, swapped the U.S. Dollar-denominated variable interest rate payments based on
3-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread (as paid under the 2.125% Interest Rate Swap discussed above) for Euro-denominated variable interest rate payments
based on the 3-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR") plus a fixed spread, which, in combination with the 2.125% Interest Rate Swap,
economically converted the Company's previously-outstanding $300 million fixed-rate 2.125% Senior Notes obligation to a €280 million floating-rate
Euro-denominated obligation. Similarly, the €274 million notional cross-currency swap, which matures on August 18, 2020, swaps the U.S. Dollar-
denominated variable interest rate payments based on 3-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread (as paid under the 2.625% Interest Rate Swap discussed above)
for Euro-denominated variable interest rate payments based on 3-month EURIBOR plus a fixed spread, which in combination with the 2.625% Interest
Rate Swap, economically converts the Company's $300 million fixed-rate 2.625% Senior Notes obligation to a €274 million floating-rate Euro-
denominated obligation.
Additionally, in August 2018, the Company entered into pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional
amount of €346 million that were designated as hedges of its net investment in certain of its European subsidiaries. These contracts, which mature on
September 15, 2025, swap the U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed interest rate payments on the Company's 3.750% Senior Notes for Euro-denominated 1.29%
fixed interest rate payments, thereby economically converting the Company's $400 million fixed-rate 3.750% Senior Notes obligation to a €346 million
fixed-rate 1.29% Euro-denominated obligation.
See Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's accounting policies relating to its derivative financial instruments.
Investments
As of March 28, 2020, the Company's investments were all classified as short-term and consisted of $252.3 million of time deposits and $243.6
million of commercial paper. As of March 30, 2019, the Company's short-term investments consisted of $1.167 billion of time deposits and $236.0 million
of commercial paper, and its non-current investments consisted of $44.9 million of time deposits.
No significant realized or unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments or impairment charges were recorded in any of the fiscal years
presented.

Commitments and Contingencies
U.S. Tax Reform
In connection with the TCJA's provision that subjects previously deferred foreign earnings to a one-time mandatory transition tax, the Company
recorded cumulative charges of approximately $241 million within its income tax provision in prior fiscal years (as described in Note 10). The remaining
related income tax payable obligation of $146.7 million as of March 28, 2020, which was reduced by foreign tax credits and other federal income tax
activity, is expected to be paid as follows:

See Note 10 for further discussion of the TCJA and its enactment-related impacts on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Employee Agreements
The Company has employment agreements with certain executives in the normal course of business which provide for compensation and certain
other benefits. These agreements also provide for severance payments under certain circumstances.
Other Commitments
Other off-balance sheet firm commitments amounted to $665.6 million as of March 28, 2020, including inventory purchase commitments of $534.9
million, outstanding letters of credit of $9.0 million, interest payments related to the Company's debt of $90.6 million, and other commitments of $31.1
million, comprised of the Company's legally-binding obligations under sponsorship, licensing, and other marketing and advertising agreements,
information technology-related service agreements, and pension-related obligations.
Other Matters
The Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation, other legal claims, and proceedings involving matters associated with or incidental to its
business, including, among other things, matters involving credit card fraud, trademark and other intellectual property, licensing, importation and
exportation of its products, taxation, unclaimed property, and employee relations. The Company believes at present that the resolution of currently pending
matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements. However, the Company's
assessment of any current litigation or other legal claims could potentially change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known or determinations
by judges, juries, or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management's evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or
claims.
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements that provide general indemnifications. The Company has not made any
significant indemnification payments under such agreements in the past and does not currently anticipate incurring any material indemnification payments.

to the election and removal of directors or as otherwise required by applicable law. All outstanding shares of Class B common stock are owned by
Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company's Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family, and are convertible at any
time into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.
Class B Common Stock Conversions
During Fiscal 2020, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., a limited liability company managed by the children of Mr. Ralph Lauren, converted 1.0 million
shares of Class B common stock into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the security. These conversions occurred
in advance of a sales plan providing for the sale of such shares of Class A common stock pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 subject to the conditions set forth therein.
These transactions resulted in a reclassification within equity and had no effect on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.

On May 13, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved an expansion of the Company's existing common stock repurchase program that
allowed it to repurchase up to an additional $600 million of Class A common stock. As of March 28, 2020, the remaining availability under the Company's
Class A common stock repurchase program was approximately $580 million. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject to overall
business and market conditions. Accordingly, as a result of current business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has temporarily
suspended its common stock repurchase program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen its liquidity.
In addition, during Fiscal 2020, Fiscal 2019, and Fiscal 2018, 0.4 million, 0.3 million, and 0.2 million shares of Class A common stock, respectively,
at a cost of $44.5 million, $32.6 million, and $17.1 million, respectively, were surrendered to or withheld by the Company in satisfaction of withholding
taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under the Company's long-term stock incentive plans.
Repurchased and surrendered shares are accounted for as treasury stock at cost and held in treasury for future use.
Dividends
Since 2003, the Company has maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on its common stock. On May 13, 2019, the Company's Board
of Directors approved an increase to the Company's quarterly cash dividend on its common stock from $0.625 to $0.6875 per share. Dividends paid
amounted to $203.9 million, $190.7 million, and $162.4 million in Fiscal 2020, Fiscal 2019, and Fiscal 2018, respectively.
As a result of current business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has temporarily suspended its quarterly cash dividend
program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen its liquidity. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the
discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend on the Company's

Stock-based Compensation
Long-term Stock Incentive Plans
On August 1, 2019, the Company's shareholders approved the 2019 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "2019 Incentive Plan"), which replaced the
Company's Amended and Restated 2010 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "2010 Incentive Plan"). The 2019 Incentive Plan provides for 1.2 million of
new shares authorized for issuance to the participants, in addition to the approximately 3.0 million shares that remained available for issuance under the
2010 Incentive Plan as of August 1, 2019. In addition, any outstanding awards under the 2010 Incentive Plan or the Company's 1997 Long-Term Stock
Incentive Plan (the "1997 Incentive Plan") that expire, are forfeited, or are surrendered to the Company in satisfaction of taxes, will become available for
issuance under the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan became effective August 1, 2019 and no further grants will be made under the 2010
Incentive Plan. Outstanding awards issued prior to August 1, 2019 will continue to remain subject to the terms of the 2010 Incentive Plan or 1997 Incentive
Plan, as applicable. As of March 28, 2020, 3.8 million shares remained available for future issuance under the Company's incentive plans.
Stock-based compensation awards that may be made under the 2019 Incentive Plan include, but are not limited to, (i) restricted stock, (ii) RSUs, and
(iii) stock options. During the fiscal periods presented, annual grants consisted entirely of restricted stock and RSUs. Additionally, for RSUs granted to
retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, vesting
continues post-retirement for all or a portion of the remaining unvested RSUs.

The Company issues its annual grants of stock-based compensation awards in the first half of each fiscal year. Due to the timing of the annual grants

Restricted Stock Awards and Service-based RSUs
Restricted shares granted to non-employee directors vest ratably over a three-year period, subject to the director's continued service to the Company.
The fair values of restricted stock awards are based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. Holders of restricted
shares are entitled to receive cash dividends in connection with the payments of dividends on the Company's Class A common stock. Effective beginning
Fiscal 2019, non-employee directors are now granted service-based RSUs in lieu of restricted shares.
Service-based RSUs granted to certain of the Company's senior executives and other employees, as well as non-employee directors, generally vest
over a three-year period, subject to the employee's continuing employment (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who
become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed). The fair values of service-based RSUs
are based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for
which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested.

Performance-based RSUs
The Company grants performance-based RSUs to its senior executives and other key employees. The fair values of performance-based RSUs are
based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which
dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested. Performance-based RSUs generally vest (i) upon the completion of a three-
year period of time (cliff vesting), subject to the employee's continuing employment (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or
employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed) and the Company's
achievement of certain performance goals established at the beginning of the three-year performance period or (ii) ratably, over a three-year period of time
(graded vesting), subject to the employee's continuing employment during the applicable vesting period (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible
employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed) and the
achievement by the Company of certain performance goals in the initial year of the three-year vesting period.
For performance-based RSUs subject to cliff vesting, beginning with grants in Fiscal 2019, the number of shares that may be earned ranges between
0% (if the specified threshold performance level is not attained) and 200% (if performance meets or exceeds the maximum achievement level) of the
awards originally granted. For such awards granted in recent years prior to Fiscal 2019, the number of shares that may be earned ranges between 0% (if the
specified threshold performance level is not attained) and 150% (if performance meets or exceeds the maximum achievement level) of the awards
originally granted. If actual performance exceeds the pre-established threshold, the number of shares earned is calculated based on the relative performance
between specified levels of achievement.

Market-based RSUs
During Fiscal 2019, the Company began granting cliff vesting RSU awards to its senior executives and other key employees, which, in addition to
being subject to continuing employment requirements (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-
eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed), are also subject to a market condition based on TSR
performance. The number of shares that vest upon the completion of a three-year period of time is determined by comparing the Company's TSR relative to
that of a pre-established peer group over the related three-year performance period. Depending on the Company's level of achievement, the number of
shares that ultimately vest may range from 0% to 200% of the awards originally granted.
The Company estimates the fair value of its TSR awards on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation, which models multiple stock price
paths of the Company's Class A common stock and that of its peer group to evaluate and determine its ultimate expected relative TSR performance
ranking. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately
satisfied.

Employee Benefit Plans
Defined Contribution Plans
The Company sponsors defined contribution benefit plans covering substantially all eligible employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who are not
covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The plans include a savings plan feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company
makes matching contributions to the plans equal to 50% of the first 6% of salary contributed by an eligible employee. Additionally, the Company makes a
supplemental matching contribution for plan years in which the Company achieves an "above target" performance level based on certain goals established
at the beginning of each fiscal year, increasing the matching contribution to between 67% and 100% depending on the performance level achieved, of the
first 6% of salary contributed by eligible employees, not to exceed the maximum contribution permitted by the plan.
Under the terms of the plans, a participant becomes 100% vested in the Company's matching contributions after five years of credited service.
Contributions made by the Company under these plans were $8.7 million, $11.2 million, and $10.6 million in Fiscal 2020, Fiscal 2019, and Fiscal 2018,
respectively.
International Defined Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors certain single-employer defined benefit plans and cash balance plans at international locations which are not considered to
be material individually or in the aggregate to the Company's financial statements. Pension benefits under these plans are based on formulas that reflect the
employees' years of service and compensation levels during their employment period. The aggregate funded status of the single-employer defined benefit
plans reflected net liabilities of $4.0 million and $2.8 million as of March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively, and were primarily recorded within
other non-current liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. These single-employer defined benefit plans had aggregate projected benefit
obligations of $52.4 million and aggregate fair values of plan assets of $48.4 million as of March 28, 2020, compared to aggregate projected benefit
obligations of $48.1 million and aggregate fair values of plan assets of $45.3 million as of March 30, 2019. The asset portfolio of the single-employer
defined benefit plans primarily consists of fixed income securities, which have been measured at fair value largely using Level 2 inputs, as described in
Note 12. Net pension expense for these plans was $5.0 million, $4.2 million, and $6.6 million in Fiscal 2020, Fiscal 2019, and Fiscal 2018, respectively.
The service cost component of $4.7 million, $4.4 million, and $4.6 million in Fiscal 2020, Fiscal 2019, and Fiscal 2018, respectively, was recorded within
SG&A expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. All other components of net pension expense during the fiscal years presented
were recorded within other income (expense), net, in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.
Union Pension Plan
The Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan and is required to make contributions to the Workers United union (which was
previously known as UNITE HERE) (the "Union") for dues based on wages paid to union employees. A portion of these dues is allocated by the Union to a
retirement fund which provides defined benefits to substantially all unionized workers. The Company does not participate in the management of the plan
and has not been furnished with information with respect to the type of benefits provided, vested and non-vested benefits, or assets.
Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, an employer, upon withdrawal from or termination of a multi-employer
plan, is required to continue funding its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits. Such liability was assumed in conjunction with the
acquisition of certain assets from a non-affiliated licensee. The Company has no current intention of withdrawing from the plan.
Other Compensation Plans
The Company had a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for certain highly compensated employees whose benefits under the 401(k) profit
sharing retirement savings plans were expected to be constrained by the operation of Internal Revenue Code limitations. These supplemental benefits
vested over time and the related compensation expense was recognized over the vesting period. Effective August 2008, the Company amended this plan,
resulting in a suspension of the annual contributions for substantially all plan participants. Further, affected participants were provided with a one-time
election to either withdraw all benefits vested in the plan in a lump sum amount or remain in the plan and receive future distributions of benefits. As of
March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, amounts accrued under this plan totaled $3.4 million and $5.1 million, respectively, and were classified within other
non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Total compensation expense recognized related to these benefits was not material in any of the
fiscal years presented.

Segment Information
The Company has three reportable segments based on its business activities and organization:
•
North America — The North America segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home
furnishings, and related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S. and Canada, excluding Club
Monaco. In North America, the Company's retail business is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its factory stores, and its digital
commerce site, www.RalphLauren.com. The Company's wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department
stores, and to a lesser extent, specialty stores.
•
Europe — The Europe segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and
related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America, excluding Club
Monaco. In Europe, the Company's retail business is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its factory stores, its concession-based
shop-within-shops, and its various digital commerce sites. The Company's wholesale business in Europe is comprised of a varying mix of
sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital partners.
•
Asia — The Asia segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and related
products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. The Company's retail business in
Asia is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its factory stores, its concession-based shop-within-shops, and its digital commerce
site, www.RalphLauren.cn, which launched in September 2018. In addition, the Company sells its products online through various third-party
digital partner commerce sites. In Asia, the Company's wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, with related
products distributed through shop-within-shops.
No operating segments were aggregated to form the Company's reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company also has
other non-reportable segments, which primarily consist of (i) sales of Club Monaco branded products made through its retail and wholesale businesses in
the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and its licensing alliances in Europe and Asia, and (ii) royalty revenues earned through its global licensing alliances,
excluding Club Monaco.
The Company's segment reporting structure is consistent with how it establishes its overall business strategy, allocates resources, and assesses
performance of its business. The accounting policies of the Company's segments are consistent with those described in Notes 2 and 3. Sales and transfers
between segments are generally recorded at cost and treated as transfers of inventory. All intercompany revenues are eliminated in consolidation and are
not reviewed when evaluating segment performance. Each segment's performance is evaluated based upon net revenues and operating income before
restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other one-time items, if any. Certain corporate overhead expenses related to global
functions, most notably the Company's executive office, information technology, finance and accounting, human resources, and legal departments, largely
remain at corporate. Additionally, other costs that cannot be allocated to the segments based on specific usage are also maintained at corporate, including
corporate advertising and marketing expenses, depreciation and amortization of corporate assets, and other general and administrative expenses resulting
from corporate-level activities and projects. Asset information by segment is not utilized for purposes of assessing performance or allocating resources, and
therefore such information has not been presented.
Effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, operating results related to the Company's business in Latin America are included within its
Europe segment due to a change in how the Company manages this business. Previously, such results were included within the Company's other non-
reportable segments. All prior period segment information has been recast to reflect this change on a comparative basis.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ralph Lauren Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ralph Lauren Corporation (the "Company") as of March 28, 2020 and March 30,
2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 28, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 28, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2020, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated May 27, 2020 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.
Adoption of ASU No. 2016-02
As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method for accounting for leases in the fiscal year ended
March 28, 2020 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). See below for discussion of our related critical audit matter.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
 
End-of-season Markdown Reserves
 
 
Description of the
Matter
As disclosed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, estimates for end-of-season markdown reserves are based on
historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, retailer
performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms.
Auditing management's estimate of end-of-season markdown reserves was complex and judgmental as reserve amounts are
sensitive to changes in market or economic conditions (including the effects of the global pandemic), and have a direct,
material impact on the amount of revenue recognized by the Company. There is also significant estimation required to
establish markdown reserve rates by brand and customer, which are based on the Company's review of the seasonal
negotiations with each customer and the expected performance of the products in the customers' stores.
F-59
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 141 OF 401]
================================================================================
How We Addressed
the Matter in Our
Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the
Company's process to calculate the end-of-season markdown reserves, including the consideration of historical experience,
actual and forecasted seasonal results, current economic and market conditions, (including the effects of the global
pandemic), retailer performance, and contractual terms as applicable.
To test the estimate of end-of-season markdown reserves, we performed audit procedures that included, among others,
assessing methodologies and testing the assumptions regarding seasonal negotiations with each customer which include the
application of market and economic conditions to individual customers and the expected performance of the products in the
customers' stores that were used by the Company to calculate the projected markdown allowances to be issued upon
settlement. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current market and economic trends, historical
results and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity
analyses of significant assumptions to substantively test the changes in the estimate that would result from reasonable
changes in the assumptions.
 
 
 
Estimated Realizable Value of Inventory
 
 
Description of the
Matter
As of March 28, 2020, the Company's net inventory balance was $736.2 million. As described in Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements, the valuation of inventory requires management to make assumptions and judgments about the
recoverability of inventory and its estimated realizable value.
The estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends, market trends and
economic conditions (including the effects of the global pandemic), future sales forecasts, on-hand inventory quantities, and
consideration of the value of existing customer orders for future sales of inventory. Given the importance of inventory to the
Company's operations and the materiality of the balance, coupled with the judgment involved in estimating future sales,
auditing management's estimated realizable value involved a higher extent of testing and the involvement of more senior
members of the engagement team in executing, supervising and reviewing the results of the procedures.
 
 
How We Addressed
the Matter in Our
Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the process to
determine the estimated realizable value of inventory, including controls over the inputs and assumptions used in
management's calculation as described above.
Our audit procedures to test the estimated realizable value of inventory included, among others, evaluating the
appropriateness of management's inputs to the calculation, including testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used
in management's calculation such as historical sales activity and loss rates for each class of inventory, write-off activity, on-
hand inventory levels and inventory aging. Our procedures also included testing the completeness of any expected net losses
on firm commitments to purchase inventory. To evaluate management's ability to accurately estimate future sales projections,
which is also a key factor in the determination of the reserve, we retrospectively reviewed actual sales compared to
projections and considered the impact of the global pandemic on market trends and economic conditions. We also tested the
mathematical accuracy of the Company's calculation.
 
 
 
Adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases
 
 
Description of the
Matter
As discussed above and as described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Accounting
Standards Update 2016-02, Leases ("ASC 842") on March 31, 2019 and recorded operating lease liabilities and related
operating lease right-of-use-assets of $1.75 billion and $1.60 billion, respectively, on its balance sheet. The Company applied
its incremental borrowing rate ("IBR") to determine the present value of the remaining lease payments for each of its
operating leases when calculating the operating lease liability and the related right-of-use asset. Additionally, in connection
with the adoption of ASC 842, the Company recorded a $131.6 million adjustment to reduce its opening retained earnings
balance for the impairment of a right-of-use asset for one of its real estate leases ("the real estate lease").
F-60
 


================================================================================
[PAGE 142 OF 401]
================================================================================
 
Auditing the Company's methodology and the assumptions applied in developing the IBR involved complex auditor
judgment due to the subjectivity inherent in the calculation. Additionally, auditing the Company's impairment of the right-of-
use asset for the real estate lease upon adoption involved significant audit effort due to the estimation involved in
determining the recoverability and fair value of the right-of-use asset.
 
 
How We Addressed
the Matter in Our
Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over the
adoption of ASC 842, including the determination of the IBR and the calculation of the impairment of the right-of-use asset
for the real estate lease. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the assumptions used in the
determination of the IBR and the recoverability of the real estate lease right-of-use asset, as well as the calculation of the
transition adjustment.
To test the Company's IBR, we involved our valuation specialists to assist us in performing audit procedures that included,
among others, evaluating the Company's selection of the IBR methodology and evaluating the significant assumptions used
in applying the selected methodology. We involved our valuation specialists to assist with testing the IBR by performing
corroborative calculations and a regression analysis to estimate the Company's credit rating. To test the Company's right-of-
use impairment adjustment upon adoption for the real estate lease, we involved our valuation specialists to assist with testing
the assumptions used in the Company's valuation.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ralph Lauren Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Ralph Lauren Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO
criteria). In our opinion, Ralph Lauren Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of March 28, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 28, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated
May 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

EXHIBIT 4.4
Description of the Registrant’s Securities 
Registered Pursuant to Section 12 of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Ralph Lauren Corporation (“we,” “our,” or “us”) has two classes of common stock outstanding, Class A and Class B.
Our Class A common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Description of Capital Stock
The following summary of the terms of our capital stock is based upon our Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), and our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”).
The summary is not complete and is qualified by reference to our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, which are filed as
exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated by reference herein. We encourage you to read our Certificate
of Incorporation, our Bylaws and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) for
additional information.
At May 22, 2020, our capital stock consists of the following, each having a par value of $.01 per share:
•
500,000,000 authorized shares of Class A common stock, of which 47,777,235 are outstanding,
•
100,000,000 authorized shares of Class B common stock, of which 24,881,276 are outstanding, and
•
30,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, none of which are outstanding.
The shares of Class B common stock outstanding are held of record by the members of the Lauren family and entities
controlled by the Lauren family.
Common Stock
The shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock are identical in all respects, except for:
•
voting rights,
•
certain conversion rights, and
•
transfer restrictions of the Class B common stock.
The number of authorized shares of any class of our capital stock may be increased or decreased by the vote of a majority of the
holders of the voting power of that class of capital stock who are entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, despite the
provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL or any equivalent provision enacted.


================================================================================
[PAGE 148 OF 401]
================================================================================
2
Voting Rights. The holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share. Holders of Class B common stock
are entitled to ten votes per share. Holders of all classes of common stock entitled to vote are treated as voting together as a single
class on all matters presented to the stockholders for their vote or approval, except for the election and the removal of directors as
discussed below, or otherwise as required by applicable law.
Composition of our Board. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that our board of directors will have between six and
20 members, plus any directors who are entitled to be elected by any series of preferred stock (these directors are referred to as
the “Preferred Directors”). We currently have 134 directors on our board of directors. Of the 134 directors, holders of Class A
common stock have the right to elect four directors and holders of Class B common stock have the right to elect nine of our
directors.
When there are shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding, and, if on the record date for
any meeting of stockholders the number of outstanding shares of Class B common stock is at least 10% of the aggregate number
of outstanding shares of all classes of common stock immediately upon the date of our initial public offering (adjusted for stock
splits, stock dividends, reclassifications, recapitalizations and reverse stock splits and similar transactions), then:
•
the holders of the Class A common stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect two (2) directors if
the board of directors (exclusive of Preferred Directors) consists of less than ten directors, three (3) directors if the
board (exclusive of Preferred Directors) consists of at least 10 but less than 13 directors, four (4) directors if the
board (exclusive of Preferred Directors) consists of at least 13 but less than 19 members and five (5) directors if
the board (exclusive of Preferred Directors) consists of 19 or more directors and
•
the holders of Class B common stock, voting as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect all other directors.
Under all circumstances, if on the record date for any meeting of stockholders the number of outstanding
shares of Class B common stock has fallen below 10% of  the aggregate number of outstanding shares of all classes of common
stock immediately upon the date of our initial public offering (adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications,
recapitalizations and reverse stock splits and similar transactions), directors that would have been elected by
a separate vote of the holders of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, will instead be elected by
the holders of the Class A common stock and the holders of the Class B common stock, voting together, with holders of Class A
common stock having one vote per share and holders of Class B common stock having ten votes per share.
Because of the disproportionate voting rights of the Class B common stock, in certain instances holders of Class B
common stock will still be able to elect a majority of the board of directors entitled to be elected by the holders of common stock,
even though the number of outstanding shares of Class B common stock is less than 10% of the number of shares of all classes of
common stock that were outstanding on the date of our initial public offering.


================================================================================
[PAGE 149 OF 401]
================================================================================
3
Removal of Directors and Vacancies. Directors may be removed with or without cause and only by those holders of the
class or classes of common stock or series of preferred stock that, as of the date the removal is effected, would be entitled to elect
that director at the next annual meeting of stockholders.
Vacancies in a directorship may be filled only by the remaining directors who were elected by the holders of each class of
common stock or series of preferred stock that elected the director creating the vacancy, and on the date that vacancy is filled,
would be entitled to elect that director at the next annual meeting of the stockholders, unless there are no remaining directors, in
which case vacancies in a directorship will be filled by the vote of the holders of the class or classes of common stock or series of
preferred stock who, voting as a separate class on the date that vacancy is filled, would be entitled to elect that director at the next
annual meeting of stockholders, or at a meeting of the holders of common stock of that class or classes or series of preferred
stock.
As used in this exhibit, the term “members of the Lauren family” includes only:
•
Ralph Lauren and his estate, guardian, conservator or committee,
•
the spouse of Ralph Lauren and her estate, guardian, conservator or committee,
•
each descendant of Ralph Lauren and their respective estates, guardians, conservators or committees,
•
each “family controlled entity”, and
•
the trustees of each “Lauren family trust”.
The term “family controlled entity” means:
•
any not-for-profit corporation where a majority of its board of directors is composed of Ralph Lauren, Mr. Lauren’s
spouse and/or descendants of Ralph Lauren,
•
any other corporation where a majority of the value of its outstanding equity is owned by members of the Lauren
family,
•
any partnership where a majority of the economic interest of its partnership interests are owned by members of the
Lauren family, and
•
any limited liability or similar company where a majority of its economic interests is owned by members of the
Lauren family.
The term “Lauren family trust” includes trusts whose primary beneficiaries are Mr. Lauren, Mr. Lauren’s spouse, Lauren
descendants, Mr. Lauren’s siblings, spouses of descendants of Ralph Lauren and each of their respective estates, guardians,
conservators or committees and/or charitable organizations, and any wholly charitable trust, where a majority of its trustees
includes Mr. Lauren, the spouse of Mr. Lauren and/or members of the Lauren family.


================================================================================
[PAGE 150 OF 401]
================================================================================
4
Dividends. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends at the same rate whenever dividends are declared
by the board out of assets legally available for their payment, after payment of any dividends required to be paid on shares of
preferred stock outstanding. We may not make any dividend or distribution to any holder of any class of common stock unless
we, simultaneously, make the same dividend or distribution to each other outstanding share of common stock regardless of class.
Whenever a dividend or other distribution is payable in shares of a class of common stock, including stock splits or
divisions of common stock:
•
only shares of Class A common stock may be distributed to Class A stockholders,
•
only shares of Class B common stock may be distributed to Class B stockholders, and
•
the number of shares of each class of common stock payable per share of that class of common stock will be equal in
number.
Whenever dividends or other distributions consist of other voting securities of ours or the voting securities of any
corporation which is a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, we will declare and pay those dividends in two separate classes of those
voting securities, identical in all respects except that:
•
the voting rights of each security issued to the holders of Class A common stock will have one-tenth of the voting
rights of each security issued to holders of Class B common stock,
•
the security issued to holders of Class B common stock will convert into the security issued to the holders of Class A
common stock upon the same terms and conditions which would apply to the conversion of Class B common stock
into Class A common stock, including having the same restrictions that apply to the transfer and ownership of the
Class B common stock, and
•
if the securities consist of voting securities of any corporation which is a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, the voting
rights which apply to each security issued to holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, relating to
election of directors, will otherwise be as comparable as is practicable to those of, in each case, the Class A common
stock and Class B common stock.
In the case of dividends or other distributions consisting of securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our voting
securities or of a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, we will provide that those convertible or exchangeable securities and the
underlying securities, be identical in all respects (including the conversion or exchange rate), except that the underlying securities
may have the same differences as they would have if we issued our voting securities, or those of a wholly owned subsidiary of
ours, rather than issuing securities that convert into, or may be exchanged for, our voting securities.


================================================================================
[PAGE 151 OF 401]
================================================================================
5
Restrictions on Additional Issuances and Transfer. We may not issue or sell any shares of Class B common stock, or any
securities which may be converted into, or exchanged or exercised for shares of Class B common stock, to any person who is not
a member of the Lauren family. The term “securities” includes, but is not limited to, any rights, options, warrants or other
securities.
Shares of Class B common stock may not be transferred, whether by sale, assignment, gift, bequest, appointment or
otherwise, to a person who is not a member of the Lauren family.
Despite these restriction on transfer any member of the Lauren family may pledge its shares of Class B common stock to
a financial institution pursuant to a bona fide pledge of the shares as collateral for indebtedness due to the pledgee so long as:
•
the shares remain subject to the transfer restrictions,
•
if the pledgee seeks to foreclose on the indebtedness or other similar action, the pledged shares of Class B common
stock may only be transferred to a member of the Lauren Family or converted into shares of Class A common stock,
as the pledgee may elect, and
•
the transfer restrictions described immediately above do not apply in the case of a merger, consolidation or business
combination of us with or into another corporation in which all of the outstanding shares of our common stock and
preferred stock regardless of class are purchased by the acquirer.
Conversion. Class A common stock has no conversion rights. Shares of Class B common stock are convertible into Class
A common stock, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time at the option of the holder, on the basis of one share of
Class A common stock for each share of Class B common stock converted.
Whenever a person is no longer a member of the Lauren family, any share of Class B common stock held by that person
at that time will automatically convert into a share of Class A common stock.
Reclassification and Merger. If a reclassification or other similar transaction occurs, and as a result the shares of Class A
common stock are converted into another security, then each holder of Class B common stock will be entitled to receive upon
conversion the amount of the other security that the holder would have received if the conversion had occurred immediately
before the record date of the reclassification or other similar transaction.
No adjustments for dividends will be made upon the conversion of any share of Class B common stock, unless:
•
a share is for payment of a dividend or other distribution, and
•
the share is converted after the record date.


================================================================================
[PAGE 152 OF 401]
================================================================================
6
In that case, the registered holder of that share at the close of business on that record date will be entitled to receive the dividend
or other distribution which was payable on that record date regardless of the fact that the share has been converted or that we are
in default in paying it.
If we enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which shares of common stock are
exchanged for, or changed into, other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then the shares of each class of common
stock will be exchanged for, or changed into, either:
•
the same amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property into or for which each share of any other class of
common stock is exchanged or changed; unless, the shares of common stock are exchanged for, or changed into,
shares of capital stock. In that case, the shares exchanged for, or changed into, may differ, but only to the extent that
the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock differ as provided in our Certificate of Incorporation, or
•
if holders of each class of common stock are to receive different distributions of stock, securities, cash and/or any
other property, then an amount of stock, securities, cash and/or property having a value equal to the value per share of
any other class of our common stock that was exchanged or changed as determined by an independent investment
banking firm of national reputation selected by the board of directors.
Liquidation. If we liquidate, any assets remaining after payment of our debts and other liabilities, and setting aside
sufficient amounts for any payment due to any holders of preferred stock, will be distributable ratably among the holders of the
Class A common stock and Class B common stock treated as a single class.
Other Provisions. Except as described below, the holders of common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights. None of
the Class A common stock or Class B common stock may be subdivided or combined in any way unless the other classes are
subdivided or combined in the same proportion.
We may not make any offering of options, rights or warrants to subscribe for shares of Class B common stock. If we make
an offering of options, rights or warrants to subscribe for shares of any other class or classes of capital stock to all holders of a
class of common stock, then we must simultaneously make an identical offering to all holders of the other classes of common
stock, unless any class of holders, voting as a separate class, agree that the offering need not be made to their class. Accordingly,
all of the options, rights or warrants offerings described in this paragraph will offer the respective holders of Class A common
stock and Class B common stock the right to subscribe at the same rate per share.
Transfer Agent and Registrar. The Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Class A common stock is Computershare Trust
Company, N.A.

systems our capital stock may be quoted or listed and without any act or vote by our stockholders, our board of directors is
authorized to:
•
issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series,
•
establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series,
•
fix the rights, powers, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series,
•
fix any qualifications, limitations or restrictions on that series, and
•
increase or decrease the number of shares of the series;
unless the shares of preferred stock would have the right to
•
vote for the election of directors under ordinary circumstances, or
•
elect 50% or more of the directors under any circumstances,
in which case, the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock is required.
No series of our preferred stock may be entitled to vote together with any class of our common stock for the election of
directors who are entitled to be elected by that class of common stock. However, upon the terms of any series of preferred stock
established by our board, any or all series of preferred stock could have preference over the common stock relating to dividends
and other distributions, upon our liquidation or could have voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the holders of
our outstanding common stock. In addition, our ability to issue preferred stock could delay, defer or prevent a change of control
of us.
Other Charter and Bylaw Provisions
Special meetings of our stockholders may be called by the board, the Chairman of the Board or our Chief Executive
Officer. Except as otherwise required by law, stockholders are not entitled to request or call a special meeting of our stockholders,
except where stockholders holding a majority of the shares of a class of common stock request a meeting in order to vote on a
matter which that class, voting as a separate class, is entitled to vote on.
In addition, our stockholders may not take any action on any matter by written consent unless they are entitled to vote on
the action as a separate class. Various provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation relating to:
•
the issuance of preferred stock,


================================================================================
[PAGE 154 OF 401]
================================================================================
8
•
action by stockholders,
•
calling of special stockholder meetings, and
•
the procedure for amending our Certificate of Incorporation and the provisions described in the above three bullet
points
may be amended only with the approval of 75% of the outstanding voting power of the common stock voting as a single class, in
addition to any voting requirements under the DGCL.
In addition, the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation relating to terms of the common stock and the provision
prohibiting preferred stockholders from voting together with any class of common stock for the election of directors entitled to be
elected by that class of common stock, may not be amended in any respect without the approval of the affected class of common
stock, voting as a separate class. The board may from time to time adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws. However, any bylaws
adopted or amended by the board may be further amended or repealed, and any bylaws may be adopted, by our stockholders by
vote of a majority of the holders of shares of our stock entitled to vote in the election of our directors.
Our Bylaws also establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholders proposals and the nominations of
candidates for election as directors. In addition, our Bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware
as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders.
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. Under Section 203, certain “business combinations”
between a Delaware corporation whose stock generally is publicly traded or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders and
an “interested stockholder” are prohibited for a three-year period following the date that such a stockholder became an interested
stockholder, unless
•
the corporation has elected in its original certificate of incorporation or by subsequent amendment not to be governed
by Section 203 (we did not make such an election),
•
the business combination was approved by the board of directors of the corporation before the other party to the
business combination became an interested stockholder,
•
upon completion of the transaction that made it an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least
85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the commencement of the transaction, excluding voting
stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have
a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan, or
•
the business combination was approved by the board of directors of the corporation and then ratified by the holders of
at least two-thirds of the voting stock which the interested stockholder did not own.


================================================================================
[PAGE 155 OF 401]
================================================================================
9
The three-year prohibition also does not apply to certain business combinations proposed by an interested stockholder
following the announcement or notification of certain extraordinary transactions involving the corporation and a person who had
not been an interested stockholder during the previous three years or who became an interested stockholder with the approval of
the majority of the corporation’s directors. The term “business combination” is defined generally to include mergers or
consolidations between a Delaware corporation and an “interested stockholder”, transactions with an “interested stockholder”
involving the assets or stock of the corporation or its majority-owned subsidiaries and transactions which increase an interested
stockholder’s percentage ownership of stock. The term “interested stockholder” is defined generally as a stockholder who,
together with affiliates and associates, owns (or, within three years prior, did own) 15% or more of a Delaware corporation’s
voting stock. Section 203 could prohibit or delay a merger, takeover or other change in control of us and therefore could
discourage attempts to acquire us.
Listing
Our Class A common stock is listed and principally traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “RL.”

Corporation, on the terms and conditions set forth herein and in accordance with the terms of the Term Sheet attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Term
Sheet”). The Executive’s employment with the Corporation is for no specified period of time and constitutes “at will” employment. As such, either the
Executive or the Corporation may terminate this Agreement and Executive’s employment relationship with the Corporation at any time for any reason, with

of the Corporation and any Committee thereof (the “Board”) or the management of the Corporation (“Management”), perform the duties of his
employment, and shall devote to the performance of such duties his full time and attention. During the Term, the Executive shall serve in such position as
the Board or Management may from time to time direct. During the Term, the Executive may engage in outside activities, provided those activities do not
conflict with the duties and responsibilities enumerated hereunder, and provided, further, that the Executive receives written approval in advance from
Management for any outside business activity that may require significant expenditure of the Executive’s time in which the Executive plans to become
involved, whether or not such activity is pursued for profit. The Executive shall be excused from performing any services hereunder during periods of
temporary incapacity and during vacations in accordance with the Corporation’s disability and vacation policies.
1.3 Place of Performance. The Executive shall be employed at the principle offices of the Corporation located in London, England;
provided, however, that the Corporation reserves the right in its sole discretion to end Executive’s international assignment in London, England at any time

business.
1.4 Compensation and Related Matters.

[PAGE 157 OF 401]
================================================================================
(c)
Stock Awards. During the Term, the Executive shall be eligible to participate in the Ralph Lauren Corporation 2010
Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan or any successor thereto (the “Incentive Plan”). All equity award grants to the Executive, if any, including but not limited
to the grants set forth in the Term Sheet, are governed by the terms of the Incentive Plan and are subject, in all cases, to approval by the Compensation &
Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors in its sole discretion.
(d)
Auto Allowance. During the Term, the Corporation shall pay the Executive a transportation allowance in the amount
of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) per month, payable consistent with the Corporation's normal payroll practices.
(e)
Expenses. During the Term, the Executive shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable
expenses incurred by the Executive in performing services hereunder, including all reasonable expenses of travel on business, provided that such expenses
are incurred and accounted for in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Corporation.
(f)
Vacations. During the Term, the Executive shall be entitled to the number of vacation days in each fiscal year, and to
compensation in respect of earned but unused vacation days, determined in accordance with the Corporation’s vacation program. The Executive shall also
be entitled to all paid holidays given by the Corporation to its employees.

Other Benefits. The Executive shall be entitled to participate in all of the Corporation’s employee benefit plans and
programs in effect during the Term as would by their terms be applicable to the Executive, including, without limitation, any life insurance plan, medical
insurance plan, dental care plan, accidental death and disability plan, and sick/personal leave program. The Executive shall also be entitled to the benefits
and allowances listed in Exhibit B to this Agreement in connection with his assignment to London (the “London Assignment”), until such time as the
London Assignment ends, which shall be determined by the Corporation in its sole and complete discretion. The Corporation shall not make any changes in
such plans or programs that would adversely affect the Executive’s benefits thereunder, unless such change occurs pursuant to a plan or program applicable
to other similarly situated employees of the Corporation and does not result in a proportionately greater reduction in the rights or benefits of the Executive
as compared with other similarly situated employees of the Corporation. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, nothing paid to the Executive
under any plan or program presently in effect or made available in the future shall be in lieu of the Base Compensation or any bonus payable under
Sections 1.4(a) and 1.4(b) hereof.
(h)
Payments upon Transfer. In the event termination payments become payable under the laws of any jurisdiction upon
Executive’s repatriation following the London Assignment; or (ii) transfer to accept a new assignment with any subsidiary or affiliate of the Corporation,
Executive agrees to forfeit in writing his rights to all such payments or, if Executive receives any such payments, Executive agrees to return them to the
Corporation immediately. If for any reason Executive decides not to forfeit and/or return such payments, the Corporation reserves the right to offset fully
the value of any such termination payments from any other form of compensation due to the Executive, including, without limitation, any compensation
due under Sections 2.3(a)(i) or 4.1(a)(i) of this Agreement.
ARTICLE II
TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
2.1 Termination of Employment. The Executive’s employment may terminate prior to the expiration of the Term under the following
circumstances:
(a)
Without Cause. The Executive’s employment shall terminate upon the Corporation notifying the Executive that his
services will no longer be required.
(b)
Death. The Executive’s employment shall terminate upon the Executive’s death.
(c)
Disability. If, as a result of the Executive’s incapacity due to physical or mental illness, the Executive shall have
been absent and unable to perform the duties hereunder on a full-time basis for an entire period of six consecutive months, the Executive’s employment
may be terminated by the Corporation following such six-month period.
(d)
Cause. The Corporation may terminate the Executive’s employment for Cause. For purposes hereof, “Cause” shall
mean:
(i)
failure by the Executive to perform the duties of the Executive hereunder (other than due to disability as
defined in 2.1(c)), provided that the conduct described in this Section 2.1(d)(i) shall not constitute Cause unless and until such failure by Executive to
perform his duties hereunder has not been cured to the satisfaction of the Corporation, in its sole discretion, within thirty (30) days after notice of such
failure has been given by the Corporation to Executive; or
2


================================================================================
[PAGE 158 OF 401]
================================================================================
(ii)
an act of fraud, embezzlement, theft, breach of fiduciary duty, dishonesty, or any other misconduct or any
violation of law (other than a traffic violation) committed by the Executive; or
(iii)
any action by the Executive causing damage to or misappropriation of Corporation assets; or
(iv)
the Executive’s wrongful disclosure of confidential information of the Corporation or any of its affiliates;
or
(v)
the Executive’s breach of Section 5.7 herein or the Executive’s engagement in any competitive activity
which would constitute a breach of this Agreement and/or of the Executive’s duty of loyalty; or
(vi)
the Executive’s breach of any employment policy of the Corporation, including, but not limited to, conduct
relating to falsification of business records, violation of the Corporation’s code of business conduct & ethics, harassment, creation of a hostile work
environment, excessive absenteeism, insubordination, violation of the Corporation’s policy on drug & alcohol use, or violent acts or threats of violence; or
(vii)
performance by the Executive of his employment duties in a manner deemed by the Corporation, in its
sole discretion, to be grossly negligent; or
(viii)
the commission of any act by the Executive, whether or not performed in the workplace, which subjects
or, if publicly known, would be likely to subject the Corporation to public ridicule or embarrassment, or would likely be detrimental or damaging to the
Corporation’s reputation, goodwill, or relationships with its customers, suppliers, vendors, licensees or employees.
(e)
Voluntary Termination. The Executive may voluntarily terminate the Executive’s employment with the Corporation
at any time, with or without Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” shall mean a termination of employment by the Executive
within sixty (60) days following the occurrence of (A) a material diminution in, or material adverse alteration to, Executive’s title, base salary, or position,
provided that a change in reporting relationship, or the removal of particular business units or functions from Executive’s purview, responsibility or
management shall not constitute a material diminution in or material adverse alteration to the Executive’s “position” for this purpose, (B) the relocation of
the Executive’s principal office outside the area which comprises a fifty (50) mile radius from the Host location as provided in his international assignment
terms as may be in effect from time to time, which is presently London, England, or from New York City, or from Geneva, Switzerland, or from such other
location as may be mutually agreed by the parties to become the location of Executive’s principal office, or (C) a failure of the Corporation to comply with
any material provision of this Agreement, provided that the events described in clauses (A), (B), and (C) above shall not constitute Good Reason (1) until
the Executive provides written notice to the Corporation of the existence of such material diminution, material alteration, relocation or failure, as the case
may be, within thirty (30) days of its occurrence and (2) unless such material diminution, material alteration, relocation or failure, as the case may be, has
not been cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of such noncompliance has been given by the Executive to the Corporation. For the avoidance of
doubt, any decision by the Corporation to terminate the London Assignment and repatriate Executive to the New York City metropolitan area and its
environs shall not constitute Good Reason, and any failure by Executive to repatriate to the New York City metropolitan area and its environs by the date
determined by the Corporation, in its sole discretion, shall constitute a voluntary termination by the Executive without Good Reason.
2.2 Date of Termination. The date of termination shall be:
(a)
if the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Executive’s death, the date of the Executive’s death;
(b)
if the Executive’s employment is terminated by reason of Executive’s disability pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or by the
Corporation pursuant to Sections 2.1(a) or 2.1(d), the date specified by the Corporation; and
(c)
if the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Executive, the day after the last day of the Notice Period, or, if
the Notice Period is waived in whole or in part by the Corporation, the date specified by the Corporation.
2.3 Effect of Termination of Employment.
(a)
If the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Corporation pursuant to Section 2.1(a), or if the Executive
resigns for Good Reason pursuant to Section 2.1(e), the Executive shall only be entitled to the following:
(i)
Severance. Subject to Section 2.3(a)(v) and Section 4.1(a) hereof, the Corporation shall: (a) beginning with
the first payroll period following the 30th day following the date of termination of Executive’s employment,
3


================================================================================
[PAGE 159 OF 401]
================================================================================
continue to pay the Executive, in accordance with the Corporation’s normal payroll practice, his Base Compensation, as in effect immediately prior to such
termination of employment, for the eighteen-month period commencing on the date of such termination (the “Severance Period”), provided that the initial
payment shall include Base Compensation amounts for all payroll periods from the date of termination through the date of such initial payment; and (b) pay
to the Executive, on the last business day of the Severance Period, an amount equal to one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of Executive’s Base
Compensation. Under no circumstances shall the Executive be entitled to any bonus payment for the fiscal year in which his employment is terminated.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to receive any severance benefits under this Section 2.3(a)(i), the Executive must sign and not timely revoke a
release and waiver of claims against the Corporation, its successors, affiliates, and assigns, in a form acceptable to the Corporation on or prior to the 30th
day following the date of termination of Executive’s employment.
(ii)
Stock Awards. The Executive’s rights with respect to any equity award grants provided to the Executive by
the Corporation shall be governed by the provisions of the Corporation’s Incentive Plan and the respective award agreements, if any, under which such
awards were granted, except as provided in Section 4.1(a).
(iii)
Welfare Plan Coverages. The Executive shall continue to participate during the Severance Period in any
group medical or dental insurance plan he participated in prior to the date of his termination, under substantially similar terms and conditions as an active
employee; provided that participation in such group medical or dental insurance plan shall only continue for as long as permitted under COBRA and
further, shall correspondingly cease at such time as the Executive (a) becomes eligible for a future employer’s medical and/or dental insurance coverage (or
would become eligible if the Executive did not waive coverage) or (b) violates any of the provisions of Article III as determined by the Corporation in its
sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive may not continue to participate in such plans on a pre-tax or tax-favored basis.
(iv)
Retirement Plans. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is specifically provided that the
Executive shall not accrue additional benefits under any pension plan of the Corporation (whether or not qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) during the Severance Period.
(v)
Section 409A. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no amounts shall be
payable pursuant to Section 2.3(a) or Section 4.1(a) unless the Executive’s termination of employment constitutes a “separation from service” within the
meaning of Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Department of Treasury Regulations. If the Executive is determined to be a “specified employee” for purposes of
Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the rules and regulations issued thereunder (the “Code”), then no payment that is
payable under Sections 2.3(a)(i) or 4.1(a) hereof (the “Severance Payment”) on account of Executive’s “separation from service” shall be made before the
date that is at least six months after the Executive’s “separation from service” (or if earlier, the date of the Executive’s death), but rather all such payments
shall be made on the date that is five business days after the expiration of that six month period, if and to the extent that the Severance Payment constitutes
deferred compensation (or may be nonqualified deferred compensation) under Section 409A of the Code and such deferral is required to comply with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, no portion of the Severance Payment shall be delayed for six months after the
Executive’s “separation from service” if such portion (x) constitutes a “short term deferral” within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(a)(4) of the
Department of Treasury Regulations, or (y) (A) it is being paid due to the Corporation’s termination of the Executive’s employment without Cause or the
Executive’s termination of employment for Good Reason; (B) it does not exceed two times the lesser of (1) the Executive’s annualized compensation from
the Corporation for the calendar year prior to the calendar year in which the termination of the Executive’s employment occurs, or (2) the maximum
amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the year in which the Executive’s employment
terminates; and (C) the payment is required under this Agreement to be paid no later than the last day of the second calendar year following the calendar
year in which the Executive incurs a “separation from service.” For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the Executive’s right to receive installment
payments pursuant to Section 2.3(a) shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. To the extent that any reimbursement of
any expense under Section 1.4(e) or in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement are deemed to constitute taxable compensation to the Executive, such
amounts will be reimbursed or provided no later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred. The amount of any
such expenses reimbursed or in-kind benefits provided in one year shall not affect the expenses or in-kind benefits eligible for reimbursement or payment
in any subsequent year, and the Executive’s right to such reimbursement or payment of any such expenses will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for
any other benefit. The determination of whether the Executive is a “specified employee” for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code as of the
time of the Executive’s separation from service shall be made by the Corporation in accordance with the terms of Section 409A of the Code and applicable
guidance thereunder (including without limitation Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i) and any successor provision thereto).
(b)
If the Executive’s employment is terminated by reason of the Executive’s death or disability, pursuant to Sections
2.1(b) or 2.1(c), the Executive (or the Executive’s designee or estate) shall only be entitled to whatever welfare plans benefits are available to the Executive
pursuant to the welfare plans the Executive participated in prior to such termination,
4


================================================================================
[PAGE 160 OF 401]
================================================================================
and whatever stock awards may have been provided to the Executive by the Corporation the terms of which shall be governed by the provisions of the
Corporation’s Incentive Plan and the respective award agreements, if any, under which such stock awards were provided.
(c)
If the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Corporation for Cause or by the Executive without Good Reason
(as defined in Section 2.1(e)), the Executive shall receive only that portion of the Executive’s then current Base Compensation payable through the
Executive’s termination date. The Executive’s rights with respect to any stock awards provided to the Executive by the Corporation shall be governed by
the provisions of the Corporation’s Incentive Plan and the respective award agreements, if any, under which such stock awards were provided.
ARTICLE III
COVENANTS OF THE EXECUTIVE
3.1 Non-Compete.
(a)
The Corporation and the Executive acknowledge that: (i) the Corporation has a special interest in and derives
significant benefit from the unique skills and experience of the Executive; (ii) the Executive will use and have access to proprietary and valuable
Confidential Information (as defined in Section 3.2 hereof) during the course of the Executive’s employment; and (iii) the agreements and covenants
contained herein are essential to protect the business and goodwill of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees. Accordingly, except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Executive covenants and agrees that during the Term, and for the twelve (12) month period following the last
day of the Term, the Executive shall not provide any labor, work, services or assistance (whether as an officer, director, employee, partner, agent, owner,
independent contractor, consultant, stockholder or otherwise) to a “Competing Business” in which the Executive has any of the same or similar
responsibilities as Executive’s responsibilities at the Corporation at any time during Executive’s employment with the Corporation, if during the Term, or
within the twenty-four (24) month period immediately preceding termination of employment. For purposes hereof, “Competing Business” shall mean any
company or business engaged in the designing, marketing or distribution of “Relevant Products,” including any of such company’s subsidiaries or licensees
(in the case of licensees to the extent related to the Corporation's products or marks), and shall include, without limitation, those brands and companies that
the Corporation has designated in writing on the date hereof, and incorporated herein by reference and attached as Schedule A, it being understood that the
Corporation may in its sole and absolute discretion modify Schedule A from time to time. For purposes hereof, “Relevant Products” shall mean products
marketed and sold by the Corporation, or any of its subsidiaries or licensees, in any quantity that is not de minimus. Thus, Executive specifically
acknowledges that Executive understands that he may not become employed by any Competing Business in any capacity for the period of one (1) year
following the termination of his employment for any reason, provided that the Executive may (i) own, solely as an investment, securities of any entity
which are traded on a national securities exchange if the Executive is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group that controls such entity and does
not, directly or indirectly, own 2% or more of any class of securities of such entity and (ii) own and invest up to 2% of any hedge funds, private equity
funds or other pooled investment vehicles so long as he is not actively involved with them. For the avoidance of doubt, the Executive shall not violate this
provision by providing services to a private equity firm (or one of its portfolio companies) which invests in a Competing Business so long as the Executive
is not providing services directly or indirectly to such Competing Business.
(b)
It is acknowledged by the Executive that the Corporation has determined to relieve the Executive from any
obligation of non-competition upon the expiration of the one year period following the termination of Executive's employment for any reason. In
consideration of that, and in consideration of all of the compensation provisions in this Agreement (including the potential for the award of equity grants
that may be made to the Executive), Executive agrees to the provisions of Section 3.1 and also agrees that the non-competition obligations imposed herein
are fair and reasonable under all the circumstances.
3.2 Confidential Information.
(a)
The Corporation owns and has developed and compiled, and will own, develop and compile, certain proprietary
techniques and confidential information as described below which have great value to its business (referred to in this Agreement, collectively, as
“Confidential Information”). Confidential Information includes not only information disclosed by the Corporation and/or its affiliates, subsidiaries and
licensees to Executive, but also information developed or learned by Executive during the course of, or as a result of, employment hereunder, which
information Executive acknowledges is and shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Corporation. Confidential Information includes all proprietary
information that has or could have commercial value or other utility in the business in which the Corporation is engaged or contemplates engaging, and all
proprietary information the unauthorized disclosure of which could be detrimental to the interests of the Corporation. Whether or not such information is
specifically labeled as Confidential Information by the Corporation is not determinative. By way of example and without limitation, Confidential
Information includes any and all information developed, obtained or owned by the
5


================================================================================
[PAGE 161 OF 401]
================================================================================
Corporation and/or its subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees concerning trade secrets, techniques, know-how (including designs, plans, procedures, processes
and research records), software, computer programs, innovations, discoveries, improvements, research, development, test results, reports, specifications,
data, formats, marketing data and plans, business plans, strategies, forecasts, unpublished financial information, orders, agreements and other forms of
documents, price and cost information, merchandising opportunities, expansion plans, designs, store plans, budgets, projections, customer, supplier and
subcontractor identities, characteristics and agreements, and salary, staffing and employment information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential
Information shall not in any event include (A) Executive’s personal knowledge and know-how relating to merchandising and business techniques which
Executive has developed over his career in the apparel business and of which Executive was aware prior to his employment, or (B) information which (i)
was generally known or generally available to the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes generally known or generally available to the
public subsequent to disclosure to Executive through no wrongful act of any person or (iii) which Executive is required to disclose by applicable law or
regulation (provided that Executive provides the Corporation with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and reasonably cooperates with the
Corporation at the Corporation’s expense in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).
(b)
Executive acknowledges and agrees that in the performance of his duties hereunder the Corporation will from time
to time disclose to Executive and entrust Executive with Confidential Information. Executive also acknowledges and agrees that the unauthorized
disclosure of Confidential Information, among other things, may be prejudicial to the Corporation’s interests, and an improper disclosure of trade secrets.
Executive agrees that he shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or otherwise communicate to any corporation, partnership,
individual or other third party, other than in the course of his assigned duties and for the benefit of the Corporation, any Confidential Information, either
during his Term of employment or thereafter.
(c)
The Executive agrees that upon leaving the Corporation’s employ, the Executive shall not take with the Executive
any software, computer programs, disks, tapes, research, development, strategies, designs, reports, study, memoranda, books, papers, plans, information,
letters, e-mails, or other documents or data reflecting any Confidential Information of the Corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees.
(d)
During the Term, Executive shall disclose to the Corporation all designs, inventions and business strategies or plans
developed for the Corporation, including without limitation any process, operation, product or improvement. Executive agrees that all of the foregoing are
and shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Corporation and that Executive shall at the Corporation’s request and cost do whatever is necessary to
secure the rights thereto, by patent, copyright or otherwise, to the Corporation.
(e)
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit Executive from reporting possible violations of law or
regulation to any governmental agency or regulatory body or making other disclosures that are protected under any law or regulation, or from filing a
charge with or participating in any investigation or proceeding conducted by any governmental agency or regulatory body.
(f)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement: (i) the Executive shall not be held criminally or civilly liable
under any federal or state trade secret law for any disclosure of a trade secret that: (A) is made: (1) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government
official, either directly or indirectly, or to any attorney; and (2) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is
made in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding; (ii) if the Executive files a lawsuit or arbitral
action for retaliation by the Corporation for reporting a suspected violation of law, the Executive may disclose the Corporation’s trade secrets to the
Executive’s attorney and use the trade secret information in the court or arbitral proceeding if the Executive: (A) files any document containing the trade
secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
3.3 Non-Solicitation of Employees. The Executive covenants and agrees that during the Term, and for the twelve (12) month period
following the last day of the Term, regardless of the reason for Executive’s termination of employment, the Executive shall not directly or indirectly solicit
or influence any other employee of the Corporation, or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees, to terminate such employee’s employment with the
Corporation, or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees, as the case may be, or to become employed by a Competing Business. As used herein,
“solicit” shall include, without limitation, requesting, encouraging, enticing, assisting, or causing, directly or indirectly.
3.4 Nondisparagement. The Executive agrees that during the Term and thereafter whether or not he is receiving any amounts pursuant to
Sections 2.3 and 4.1, the Executive shall not make any statements or comments that reasonably could be considered to shed an adverse light on the business
or reputation of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees, the Board or any officer of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries,
affiliates or licensees; provided, however, the foregoing limitation shall not apply to (i) compliance with legal process or subpoena, or (ii) statements in
response to an inquiry from a court or regulatory body.

3.5 Remedies.
(a)
The Executive acknowledges and agrees that in the event the Corporation reasonably determines that the Executive
has breached any provision of this Article III, that such conduct will constitute a failure of the consideration for which stock awards had been previously
granted to the Executive or could be awarded in the future to Executive, and notwithstanding the terms of any stock award agreement, plan document, or
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Corporation may in its sole discretion notify the Executive that all unexercised stock options,
restricted stock units, and other equity awards that Executive has are forfeited. Further, the Executive shall immediately forfeit the right to receive any
further grants of or vest any further in any unvested stock options, unvested restricted stock units or other unvested equity awards of the Corporation at the
time of such notice, and Executive waives any right to assert that any such conduct by the Corporation violates any federal or state statute, case law or
policy.
(b)
If the Corporation reasonably determines that the Executive has breached any provision contained in this Article III,
the Corporation shall have no further obligation to make any payment or provide any benefit whatsoever to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement, and
may also recover from the Executive all such damages as it may be entitled to at law or in equity. In addition, the Executive acknowledges that any such
breach is likely to result in immediate and irreparable harm to the Corporation for which money damages are likely to be inadequate. Accordingly, the
Executive consents to injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief upon the institution of proceedings therefor by the Corporation in order to protect the
Corporation’s rights hereunder. Such relief may include, without limitation, an injunction to prevent: (i) the breach or continuation of Executive’s breach;
(ii) the Executive from disclosing any trade secrets or Confidential Information (as defined in Section 3.2); (iii) any Competing Business from receiving
from the Executive or using any such trade secrets or Confidential Information; and/or (iv) any such Competing Business from retaining or seeking to
retain any employees of the Corporation.
3.6 The provisions of this Article III shall survive the termination of this Agreement and Executive’s Term of employment.
ARTICLE IV
CHANGE IN CONTROL
4.1 Change in Control.
(a)
Effect of a Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if the Executive’s
employment is terminated within twelve (12) months following a Change in Control (as defined in Section 4.1(b) hereof) during the Term by the
Corporation for any reason other than Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, then:
(i)
Severance. The Corporation shall pay to the Executive, in lieu of any amounts otherwise due to him under
Section 2.3(a) hereof, within fifteen (15) days of the Executive’s termination of employment, or within the timeframe required by Section 2.3(a)(v) hereof
if applicable, a lump sum amount equal to two (2) times the sum of: (A) the Executive’s Base Compensation, as in effect immediately prior to such
termination of employment; and (B) the bonus paid to the Executive for the most recently completed fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which his
employment is terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, a portion of such lump
sum payment will not be payable at such time if the duration of the Severance Period that would have otherwise applied under Section 2.3(a)(i) (had a
Change in Control not occurred during the twelve-month period prior to such termination of employment) would have extended beyond the end of the
second calendar year following the calendar year in which such termination of employment occurs (any such period beyond the end of such second
calendar year is the “Extended Severance Payment Period”).  In addition, such other amounts that otherwise would have been payable to the Executive
under Section 2.3(a)(i) had a Change in Control not occurred during the twelve (12) month period prior to such termination of employment, and that would
have constituted nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, will also not be included as part of such lump sum payment.  In
such event, an amount equal to the aggregate installment payments that would have been payable during the Extended Severance Payment Period, and the
amounts described in the preceding sentence, shall be deducted from the amount otherwise payable in a lump sum in accordance with the first sentence
hereof. Such deducted amount shall, instead, be payable at the same time that, and in the same manner as, such payments would have been paid if the
Executive’s employment had been terminated pursuant to Section 2.3(a) hereof rather than within a twelve-month period following a Change in Control.
(ii)
Stock Awards. Subject to Section 2.3(a)(v), the Executive shall immediately become vested in any unvested
stock options granted to the Executive by the Corporation prior to the Change in Control and Executive will have six (6) months from the date of
termination under this circumstance to exercise all vested options (but in no event later than the expiration date of such options). In addition, subject to
Section 2.3(a)(v), any awards of PSUs and restricted shares which are unvested shall be deemed vested immediately prior to such Change in Control.

================================================================================
[PAGE 163 OF 401]
================================================================================
(b)
Definition. For purposes hereof, a “Change in Control” shall mean the occurrence of any of the following:
(i) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to any “person” or “group” (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”)) other than Permitted Holders;
(ii) any person or group is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Act,
except that a person shall be deemed to have “beneficial ownership” of all shares that any such person has the right to acquire, whether such right is
exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time), directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the total voting power of the voting stock of the
Corporation, including by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise; provided, however, that for purposes of this Agreement, the following acquisitions
shall not constitute a Change in Control: (I) any acquisition by the Corporation or any affiliate, (II) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan sponsored

with clauses (A), (B) and (C) of subsection (v) below;
(iii) during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, Present and/or New Directors cease for any reason to
constitute a majority of the Board;
(iv) the Permitted Holders’ beneficial ownership of the total voting power of the voting stock of the Corporation falls
below 30 percent and either Ralph Lauren is not nominated for a position on the Board of Directors, or he stands for election to the Board of Directors and
is not elected;
(v) the consummation of a reorganization, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange or similar
form of corporate transaction involving the Corporation that requires the approval of the Corporation’s stockholders, whether for such transaction or the
issuance of securities in the transaction (a “Business Combination”), unless immediately following such Business Combination: (A) more than 50% of the
total voting power of (x) the entity resulting from such Business Combination (the “Surviving Company”), or (y) if applicable, the ultimate parent entity
that directly or indirectly has beneficial ownership of sufficient voting securities eligible to elect a majority of the members of the board of directors (or the
analogous governing body) of the Surviving Company (the “Parent Company”), is represented by the shares of voting stock of the Corporation that were
outstanding immediately prior to such Business Combination (or, if applicable, is represented by shares into which the shares of voting stock of the
Corporation were converted pursuant to such Business Combination), and such voting power among the holders thereof is in substantially the same
proportion as the voting power was among the holders of the shares of voting stock of the Corporation that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Business Combination, (B) no person (other than any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Surviving Company or the Parent Company, or
one or more Permitted Holders), is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of the total voting power of the outstanding
voting securities eligible to elect members of the board of directors of the Parent Company (or the analogous governing body) (or, if there is no Parent
Company, the Surviving Company) and (C) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors (or the analogous governing body) of the Parent
Company (or, if there is no Parent Company, the Surviving Company) following the consummation of the Business Combination were Board members at
the time of the Board’s approval of the execution of the initial agreement providing for such Business Combination; or
(vi) the stockholders of the Corporation approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation.
For purposes of this Section 4.1(b), the following terms have the meanings indicated: “Permitted Holders” shall mean, as of the date of determination: (A)
any and all of Ralph Lauren, his spouse, his siblings and their spouses, and descendants of them (whether natural or adopted) (collectively, the “Lauren
Group”); and (B) any trust established and maintained primarily for the benefit of any member of the Lauren Group and any entity controlled by any
member of the Lauren Group. “Present Directors” shall mean individuals who at the beginning of any one year period were members of the Board. “New
Directors” shall mean any directors whose election by the Board or whose nomination for election by the shareholders of the Corporation was approved by
a vote of a majority of the directors of the Corporation who, at the time of such vote, were either Present Directors or New Directors but excluding any such
individual whose initial assumption of office occurs solely as a result of an actual or threatened proxy contest with respect to the election or removal of
directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person other than the Board.

that are not set forth expressly in this Agreement. Any amendments to this Agreement must be in writing and must be signed and agreed to by both the
Corporation and the Executive. Executive agrees that if the Corporation informs him that an amendment to this Agreement is required in order for
Executive and/or the Corporation to comply with a material change in law or governmental regulation, Executive will not unreasonably withhold his
agreement to such an amendment.
5.3 Governing Law. The validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the
laws of the State of New York without reference to New York’s choice of law rules. Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or Executive’s employment, whether contractual or non-contractual, including without limitation any federal or state statutory claim, common
law or tort claim, or claim for attorneys fees, as well as any such controversy, claim or dispute between Executive and an officer, director or employee of

events leading up to the arbitration, shall be held in strict confidence, unless disclosure is required by law or SEC or other governmental reporting
obligation. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s award in any court having jurisdiction. Executive acknowledges that any arbitration brought under
this Agreement must be on an individual basis, and Executive may not join or consolidate claims in arbitration by other employees, or litigate in court or
arbitrate any claims as a representative or member of a class. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may seek injunctive or other declaratory relief
to enforce any provision of Article III of this Agreement in any court of competent jurisdiction.
5.4 No Mitigation or Offset. In the event the Executive’s employment with the Corporation terminates for any reason, the Executive shall
not be obligated to seek other employment following such termination and there shall be no offset of the payments or benefits set forth herein.
5.5 Withholding. All payments required to be made by the Corporation hereunder to the Executive or the Executive’s estate or
beneficiaries shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts as the Corporation may reasonably determine it should withhold pursuant to any
applicable law.

================================================================================
[PAGE 165 OF 401]
================================================================================
5.6 Attorney’s Fees. Each party shall bear its own attorney’s fees and costs incurred in any action or dispute arising out of this Agreement
and/or the employment relationship.
5.7 No Conflict. Executive represents and warrants that he is not party to any agreement, contract, understanding, covenant, judgment or
decree or under any obligation, contractual or otherwise, with any other party that in any way restricts or adversely affects his ability to act for the
Corporation in all of the respects contemplated hereby, including but not limited to any obligations to comply with any non-compete or non-solicitation
provisions. Executive represents and warrants that he has not disclosed, will not disclose, and has no intention of disclosing any trade secrets or any
confidential and/or proprietary business information of any other company to the Corporation or to any individual employed by or associated with the
Corporation, nor has he used or will he use any such information for the Corporation’s or his benefit.
5.8 Enforceability. Each of the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement are separate and independent covenants, each of
which has been separately bargained for and the parties hereto intend that the provisions of each such covenant shall be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible. Should the whole or any part or provision of any such separate covenant be held or declared invalid, such invalidity shall not in any way affect
the validity of any other such covenant or of any part or provision of the same covenant not also held or declared invalid. If any covenant shall be found to
be invalid but would be valid if some part thereof were deleted or the period or area of application reduced, then such covenant shall apply with such
minimum modification as may be necessary to make it valid and effective. The failure of either party at any time to require performance by the other party
of any provision hereunder will in no way affect the right of that party thereafter to enforce the same, nor will it affect any other party’s right to enforce the
same, or to enforce any of the other provisions in this Agreement; nor will the waiver by either party of the breach of any provision hereof be taken or held
to be a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of such provision or as a waiver of the provision itself.
5.9 Miscellaneous. No right or interest to, or in, any payments shall be assignable by the Executive; provided, however, that this
provision shall not preclude the Executive from designating in writing one or more beneficiaries to receive any amount that may be payable after the
Executive’s death and shall not preclude the legal representative of the Executive’s estate from assigning any right hereunder to the person or persons
entitled thereto. If the Executive should die while any amounts would still be payable to the Executive hereunder, all such amounts shall be paid in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive’s written designee or, if there be no such designee, to the Executive’s estate. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Executive, the Executive’s heirs and legal representatives and the
Corporation and its successors. The section headings shall not be taken into account for purposes of the construction of any provision of this Agreement.
5.10 Meaning of Signing This Agreement. By signing this Agreement, Executive expressly acknowledges and agrees that (a) he has
carefully read it and fully understands what it means; (b) he has been advised in writing to discuss this Agreement with an independent attorney of his own
choosing before signing it and has had a reasonable opportunity to confer with his attorney and has discussed and reviewed this Agreement with his
attorney prior to executing it and delivering it to the Corporation; (c) he has had answered to his satisfaction any questions he has with regard to the
meaning and significance of any of the provisions of this Agreement; and (d) he has agreed to this Agreement knowingly and voluntarily of his own free
will and was not subjected to any undue influence or duress, and assents to all the terms and conditions contained herein with the intent to be bound hereby.
5.11 Compliance with Section 409A. The parties acknowledge and agree that, to the extent applicable, this Agreement shall be
interpreted in accordance with, and the parties agree to use their best efforts to achieve timely compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and the
Department of Treasury Regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder (“Section 409A”), including without limitation any such regulations
or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the
Corporation determines that any compensation or benefits payable or provided hereunder may be subject to Section 409A, the Corporation reserves the
right (without any obligation to do so or to indemnify the Executive for failure to do so) to adopt such limited amendments to this Agreement and
appropriate policies and procedures, including amendments and policies with retroactive effect, that the Corporation reasonably determines are necessary or
appropriate to (a) exempt the compensation and benefits payable under this Agreement from Section 409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the
compensation and benefits provided with respect to this Agreement or (b) comply with the requirements of Section 409A.

This Exhibit B confirms the terms and conditions governing your expatriate assignment from New York, US (Home Location) to London, United Kingdom
(Host Location) and provides details of the support you will receive under the Ralph Lauren Long Term Global Assignment Policy. The terms and
conditions outlined in this letter are in effect only for the period of the Assignment, which may be terminated by the Company at any time in its sole
discretion. Following the end of the Assignment, you will no longer receive the premiums, allowances, differentials and other assignment-specific benefits
provided while on the Assignment.
GENERAL INFORMATION
Term
Your international assignment to London, United Kingdom (the “Assignment”) will begin on March 31, 2019 (“Assignment Start Date”).
Immigration
This agreement is contingent upon your obtaining the appropriate government clearances, visas and work permits. The Company will assist you in ensuring
these immigration matters are properly handled and will bear the costs for you to obtain the necessary visas, medical examinations and/or immunizations,
as well as reasonable travel expenses associated with fulfilling these requirements. The Assignment will immediately terminate and you will be repatriated
if any necessary immigration visa(s), work permit(s) and related documentation are withheld, withdrawn or expire without renewal.
Point-of-Origin
Your Home office location has been designated as New York, New York, US, and it is anticipated that you will return to this location upon the end of your
assignment.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Employee Benefits
During the Assignment, with the exception of your medical and dental plans, you will maintain benefit coverage under the US benefit plans as offered to
US employees. We will provide medical coverage for you and your family under our UHC Global Medical plan and information will be provided
separately. Questions about your other US benefit plans should be addressed to the Company’s benefits department. Employee contributions for benefits
will be deducted from your paycheck.
Relocation
You will relocate from Geneva, Switzerland to London, United Kingdom where you will be based for the length of the Assignment. The Company will
provide the services of a relocation company to assist you in settling in to your new surroundings. This service will include home search and area tours to
familiarize you with the neighborhoods where you will live and work. All reasonable costs for this service will be borne by the Company.
Relocation Allowance
To assist with the cost of establishing a residence, a net relocation allowance of $50,000 or local equivalent will be provided at the time of relocation
through the Company’s vendor that assists with relocations. This allowance is to be used at your discretion to cover ancillary expenses such as but not
limited to: driver’s licenses and fees, bank charges, renter’s insurance; small appliances; cleaning or handyman services, membership fees, etc.
Immigration Assistance
The Company will assist you in obtaining all required passports, work permits and visas. The time required to obtain these documents and for processing

================================================================================
[PAGE 170 OF 401]
================================================================================
House Hunting Trip (Pre-move)
The Company will cover the cost of one house hunting trip for you and your spouse/domestic partner if applicable. Reasonable expenses for up to
seven days will be reimbursed related to transportation, hotel, food, rental car and incidentals based on the Company’s Business Travel Policy.
Shipment of Household Goods
The Company will pay all reasonable expenses for packing, transporting and insuring your household and personal goods as well as any applicable
customs, duties or fees incurred.
Storage of Household Goods
The Company will pay all reasonable expenses for storage of belongings for the duration of your assignment and up to 60 days upon completion
of the assignment.
Relocation Airfare
The Company will cover the cost of direct route one-way airfare for you and your accompanying dependents and car service to/from the airport, in
accordance with the Business Travel Policy.
Temporary Living
For a period of up to 30 days, you will be provided with a corporate apartment in your new work location. You will also be provided with up to 7
days in a hotel if required in your Origin Country. This assistance is also provided upon repatriation, prior to your departure to return home.
ASSIGNMENT ALLOWANCES
The Company provides allowances designed to equalize your purchasing power and living standard to comparable levels experienced in your Home
country and has engaged the services of a recognized international consulting firm to provide economic data, cost of living indices and exchange rate
fluctuations for this purpose. This data is updated several times each year in consideration of changes in inflation or currency. Applying this data, the
following allowances will be delivered to you via your bi-weekly paycheck, effective upon moving into your permanent living quarters in the host location.
Goods & Services Differential (G&S)
A G&S differential targets your pre-assignment purchasing level and is determined on the basis of a “typical” market basket of goods and services. While
the market basket may not be the exact replica of your own spending habits, it has been properly weighted by the international economic consulting service.
G&S is based on current market data supplied by a third-party vendor.  The market data compares the cost of goods and services in your home location
versus your host location, as well as fluctuations in exchange rates. This also takes into account any changes in family size (number of dependents) that is
with you on assignment. 
Your initial G&S differential will be $27,464 per year or $1,056.31 per pay period. This G&S differential will be reviewed and adjusted (if applicable)
when your assignment commences. Any tax assessed on this assistance will be borne by the Company.
This allowance is reviewed semi-annually (February/March and August/September) and may be adjusted in accordance with changes in costs, either up or
down. If there is a change of more than 5% in either direction, your G&S will be adjusted. Please note that, as standard practice, we cap any single decrease
at 15% unless there is a decrease in the family size.
Please note that your G&S differential includes an amount for utilities and no additional coverage for utilities will be provided by the Company.
Should the family size that is with you on assignment change at any time while on assignment, the G&S allowance will be updated accordingly to reflect
this change. Please notify global mobility immediately if there is a change in the number of the family size that is on assignment with you.
Housing Allowance
While on the Assignment, you are expected to contribute to the cost of your housing. A “housing norm” represents a statistical average that a person would
have paid had they remained at home, based on family size and income level. This amount, according to the international consulting firm data based on
your income and family size is $56,604 annually. Your annual housing cost is expected to be $164,113 annually (or $13,676 per month. As a result, the
Company will provide you with a housing allowance of up to $107,509 per year (Housing cost of $164,113 less $56,604 housing norm). Any tax assessed
on this allowance will be borne by the Company.
15


================================================================================
[PAGE 171 OF 401]
================================================================================
In addition, the Company will pay the cost of associated rental agency fees, any required advance rent payments and security deposits. You will be
responsible for any charges or damages applied against the security deposit.
Note: In general, home ownership in the host location while on global assignment is discouraged because it can impact residential status and have negative
tax implications. Therefore, should you choose to purchase housing, Company housing assistance would be discontinued. In addition, the Company will
not reimburse any costs or expenses associated with the purchase or subsequent sale of any residence. Any increase in tax liability as a result of home
purchase would be your responsibility.
Home Leave Allowance
The Company will provide you with a home leave allowance of $30,000 per year paid bi-weekly through your U.S international payroll, to be used for your
and your family’s travel. The Home Leave allowance will be reflected in your paycheck once the assignment has started. Home leave is counted as vacation
time (except any time spent conducting business). Any additional expenses (ie, car service, airport transfers etc.) will be your responsibility. All taxes
assessed with this payment will be borne by the Company. Should the family size change at any time while on assignment, the travel allowance will be
updated accordingly to reflect this change. Home leave cannot be booked via the Company’s travel department.
Emergency Travel
In the event of the serious illness, accident or death of a member of your immediate family, the Company will reimburse emergency round trip travel costs
for you and accompanying dependents. All travel will be based on the Company’s business Travel Policy and must be arranged through the Company’s
travel department. Please reach out to Global Mobility to coordinate the booking as airfare costs will be charged to the Global Mobility credit card.
Education Assistance
Education assistance will be provided for your school aged children (from 3 years up to the age of 18) to attend school in the United Kingdom.  The
Company or its internartional assignment vendor will reimburse or pay the school directly upon providing all the supporting invoices and/or receipts. The
company will cover up to $30,000 per child annually. Any additional costs will be your responsibility. Any tax assessed on this assistance will be borne by
the Company.
PERSONAL INCOME TAXES
During the Assignment, you may be subject to income tax and reporting requirements in both your Home and Host country. To ensure that you incur no
additional income tax cost as a result of your international service, the Company provides protection under a Tax Equalization policy for actual taxes
assessed on your Company sourced income for the duration of the Assignment.
You continue to be responsible for your Home country income and social security taxes on your compensation, i.e., base salary, bonus, PSU, PRSU, RSU
vesting and stock option exercises, as if you remained at home.  While on assignment, this obligation becomes known as your hypothetical tax liability
and is deducted from your pay each cycle to satisfy federal, state, or local taxes payable on Company sourced income. Additionally, your social security tax
will continue to be deducted on an actual basis as required by law.
The Company will provide and pay for the services of an international accounting firm to calculate your hypothetical liability and prepare your actual
Home and Host tax returns while on assignment. Because your hypothetical tax payments are an approximation of your Home country tax liability based
on your Company sourced income only, at the end of each tax year, the accounting firm will prepare a tax equalization calculation to determine if your final
home country tax liability is greater than the hypothetical tax withheld from your pay. If so, you will be responsible to the Company for the difference. If it
is less, the Company will pay you the difference.
The intent of any tax assistance is to make you no better or worse off than if you stayed continually in your home location. Taxes paid on your behalf may
result in an increase of tax refunds due to you or a reduction in your U.S. tax obligation. If your refund is increased or your obligation decreased as a result
of credits included from company funded tax payments, you will need to return this funding to the Company. Note that in many circumstances, tax services
are required for years after completion of an assignment. You are agreeing that the accounting firm will provide a detailed summary outlining the impact of
the taxes paid.

================================================================================
TRAVEL CALENDAR
You are responsible for maintaining records of your travel for the duration of the Assignment and providing this information to the accounting firm for the
preparation of all required tax returns. In addition, you agree to provide all necessary information and documents, in a timely manner, to the accounting
firm so they may prepare your tax returns in the time required by law. If you do not comply with these requirements, the cost of any penalties assessed by
the taxing authorities in each location will be your responsibility.
If you terminate your employment other than for “Good Reason” (as defined in the Agreement), or if the Company terminates your employment for
“Cause” (as defined in the Agreement), in each case within twelve (12) months of the Assignment Start Date, then you shall reimburse the Company for the
full amount of the relocation benefits and any up-front housing allowance benefits paid to you in accordance with this Exhibit B to the Agreement within
30 days of the date of termination of your employment. If you do not repay the aforementioned payments within this time period, the Company has the
right to immediately recover the aforementioned payments from you, as well as any attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in recovering the aforementioned
payments.

================================================================================
[PAGE 174 OF 401]
================================================================================
any of the above Performance Criteria may be compared to the performance of a group of comparator companies, or published or special index that the
Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate, or compared to various stock market indices. In the event that applicable tax and/or securities laws

sole discretion to make such changes without obtaining stockholder approval.
“Performance Formula” shall mean, for a Performance Period, the one or more objective formulas applied against the relevant Performance Goal to
determine, with regard to the Performance Award of a particular Participant, whether all, some portion but less than all, or none of the Award has been
earned for the Performance Period.
“Performance Goals” shall mean, for a Performance Period, the one or more goals established by the Committee for the Performance Period based
upon the Performance Criteria. The Committee is authorized at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, to adjust or modify the calculation of a
Performance Goal for such Performance Period in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants, including but not limited to the
occurrence of one or more of the following events: (a) asset write-downs, (b) litigation or claim judgments or settlements, (c) the effect of changes in tax
laws, accounting principles, or other laws or provisions affecting reported results, (d) any reorganization and restructuring programs, (e) items that are

3.
PARTICIPATION.
Participants shall be selected by the Committee from among the Executive Officers. The selection of an Executive Officer as a Participant to receive
an Award (including a Performance Award) shall not entitle such individual to be selected as a Participant with respect to any subsequent Awards.
4.
AWARDS.
4.1. Award Schedules. With respect to each Award, the Committee shall establish for such Performance Period an Award Schedule for each
Participant. The Award Schedule shall set forth the applicable Performance Period (and in the case of Performance Awards, the Performance Criteria,
Performance Goal(s), and Performance Formula(s)) and such other information as the Committee may determine. Award Schedules may vary from
Performance Period to Performance Period and from Participant to Participant.
4.2. Determination of Awards. A Participant shall be eligible to receive payment in respect of an Award only to the extent that the applicable
conditions of such Award are satisfied, and, in the case of a Performance Award, to the extent that the Performance Goal(s) for such Award are achieved
and the Performance Formula as applied against such Performance Goal(s) determines that all or some portion of such Participant’s Award has been earned
for the Performance Period, all as determined by the Committee. As soon as practicable after the close of each Performance Period, the Committee shall
review and determine whether, and to what extent, the Performance Goals for the Performance Period have been achieved and, if so, to calculate that
amount of the Award earned by each Participant for such Performance Period based upon such Participant’s Performance Formula. Anything in this Plan to
the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum Award payable to any Participant with respect to each Plan Year (or portion thereof) shall be $20,000,000.
4.3. Payment of Awards. Awards shall be paid in a lump sum cash payment as soon as practicable after the amount thereof has been determined in
accordance with Section 4.2, but in no event later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the third month following the Plan Year for which the Award relates (or
by such later date as would still qualify as a short-term deferral for purposes of Section 409A of the Code). The Committee may, subject to such terms and
conditions and within such limits as it may from time to time establish, permit one or more Participants to defer the receipt of amounts due under the Plan
in a manner consistent with the requirements of Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent an amount was intended to be paid so as
to qualify as a short-term deferral under Code Section 409A and the applicable regulations, then such payment may be delayed if the requirements of
Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(4)(ii) are met.
 
2


================================================================================
[PAGE 175 OF 401]
================================================================================
5.
TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
Termination of Employment Prior to the Last Day of the Performance Period. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, no Award with
respect to a Performance Period will be payable to any Participant who is not an employee of the Company on the last day of such Performance Period.
Furthermore, except as otherwise determined by the Committee, a Participant shall be eligible to receive payment of his or her Award earned during a
Performance Period, so long as the Participant is employed on the last day of such Performance Period, notwithstanding any subsequent termination of
employment prior to the actual payment of the Award.
6.
ADMINISTRATION.
6.1. In General. The Committee shall have full and complete authority, in its sole and absolute discretion, (i) to exercise all of the powers granted to
it under the Plan, (ii) to construe, interpret and implement the Plan and any related document, (iii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules relating to the Plan,
(iv) to make all determinations necessary or advisable in administering the Plan, and (v) to correct any defect, supply any omission and reconcile any
inconsistency in the Plan.
6.2. Determinations. The actions and determinations of the Committee or others to whom authority is delegated under the Plan on all matters
relating to the Plan and any Awards shall be final and conclusive. Such determinations need not be uniform and may be made selectively among persons
who receive, or are eligible to receive, Awards under the Plan, whether or not such persons are similarly situated.
6.3. Appointment of Experts. The Committee may appoint such accountants, counsel, and other experts as it deems necessary or desirable in
connection with the administration of the Plan.
6.4. Delegation. The Committee may delegate to others the authority to execute and deliver such instruments and documents, to do all such acts and
things, and to take all such other steps deemed necessary, advisable or convenient for the effective administration of the Plan in accordance with its terms
and purposes, except that the Committee shall not delegate any authority with respect to decisions regarding Plan eligibility or the amount, timing or other
material terms of Awards.
6.5. Books and Records. The Committee and others to whom the Committee has delegated such duties shall keep a record of all their proceedings
and actions and shall maintain all such books of account, records and other data as shall be necessary for the proper administration of the Plan.
6.6. Payment of Expenses. The Company shall pay all reasonable expenses of administering the Plan, including, but not limited to, the payment of
professional, attorney and expert fees.
6.7. Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, it is intended that the provisions of this Plan comply with
Section 409A of the Code, and all provisions of this Plan shall be construed and interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes
or penalties under Section 409A of the Code. Each Participant is solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may be
imposed on or in respect of such Participant in connection with this Plan or any other plan maintained by the Company (including any taxes and penalties
under Section 409A of the Code), and neither the Company nor any Affiliate shall have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold such Participant (or
any beneficiary) harmless from any or all of such taxes or penalties. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary and only to the extent
required to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, if any Participant is a “specified employee” within the
meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, no payments in respect of any Award that are “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the
Code shall be made to such Participant prior to the date that is six months after the date of Participant’s “separation from service” (as defined in
Section 409A of the Code) or, if earlier, Participant’s date of death. Following any applicable six (6) month delay, all such delayed payments will be paid in
a single lump sum on the earliest permissible payment date. With respect to any Award that is considered “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A
of the Code, references in the Plan to “termination of employment” (and substantially similar phrases) shall mean “separation from service” within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, in the event that the timing of payments in respect of any Award (that
would otherwise be considered “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code) would be accelerated upon the occurrence of (i) a Change in
Control, no such acceleration shall be permitted unless the event giving rise to the Change in Control satisfies the definition of a change in the ownership or
effective control of a corporation, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation pursuant to Section 409A of the Code
or (ii) a disability, no such acceleration shall be permitted unless the disability also satisfies the definition of “Disability” pursuant to Section 409A of the
Code. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, each of the payments that may be made in respect of any Award granted under the Plan is designated as
separate payments.
7.
MISCELLANEOUS.
7.1. Nonassignability. No Award may be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by a Participant
otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or
encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate; provided that the designation of a beneficiary shall not constitute an
assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance.
3


================================================================================
[PAGE 176 OF 401]
================================================================================
7.2. Withholding Taxes. Whenever payments under the Plan are to be made or deferred, the Company will withhold therefrom, or from any other
amounts payable to or in respect of the Participant, an amount sufficient to satisfy any applicable governmental withholding tax requirements related
thereto.
7.3. Amendment or Termination of the Plan. The Plan may be amended or terminated by the Board of Directors in any respect except that (i) no
amendment may be made after the date on which an Executive Officer is selected as a Participant for a Performance Period that would adversely affect the
rights of such Participant with respect to such Performance Period without the consent of the affected Participant and (ii) no amendment shall be effective
without the approval of the stockholders of the Company to increase the maximum Award payable under the Plan.
7.4. Other Payments or Awards. Nothing contained in the Plan will be deemed in any way to limit or restrict the Company from making any award
or payment to any person under any other plan, arrangement or understanding, whether now existing or hereafter in effect.
7.5. Payments to Other Persons. If payments are legally required to be made to any person other than the person to whom any amount is payable
under the Plan, such payments will be made accordingly. Any such payment will be a complete discharge of the liability of the Company under the Plan.
7.6. Unfunded Plan. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary
relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the
Company pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.
7.7. Limits of Liability. No member of the Board, the Committee or any employee or agent of the Company (each such person, an “Indemnifiable
Person”) shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken or any determination made with respect to the Plan or any Award hereunder (unless
constituting fraud or a willful criminal act or omission). Each Indemnifiable Person shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and
from any loss, cost, liability, or expense (including attorneys’ fees) that may be imposed upon or incurred by such Indemnifiable Person in connection with
or resulting from any action, suit or proceeding to which such Indemnifiable Person may be a party or in which such Indemnifiable Person may be involved
by reason of any action taken or omitted to be taken or determination made under the Plan or any Award and against and from any and all amounts paid by
such Indemnifiable Person with the Company’s approval, in settlement thereof, or paid by such Indemnifiable Person in satisfaction of any judgment in any
such action, suit or proceeding against such Indemnifiable Person, and the Company shall advance to such Indemnifiable Person any such expenses
promptly upon written request (which request shall include an undertaking by the Indemnifiable Person to repay the amount of such advance if it shall
ultimately be determined as provided below that the Indemnifiable Person is not entitled to be indemnified); provided that the Company shall have the
right, at its own expense, to assume and defend any such action, suit or proceeding and once the Company gives notice of its intent to assume the defense,
the Company shall have sole control over such defense with counsel of the Company’s choice. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be available
to an Indemnifiable Person to the extent that a final judgment or other final adjudication (in either case not subject to further appeal) binding upon such
Indemnifiable Person determines that the acts or omissions or determinations of such Indemnifiable Person giving rise to the indemnification claim resulted
from such Indemnifiable Person’s fraud or willful criminal act or omission or that such right of indemnification is otherwise prohibited by law or by the
Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or By Laws. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of or otherwise supersede any other
rights of indemnification to which such Indemnifiable Persons may be entitled under the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or
By Laws, as a matter of law, individual indemnification agreement or contract or otherwise, or any other power that the Company may have to indemnify
such Indemnifiable Persons or hold them harmless.
7.8. No Right of Employment. Nothing in this Plan will be construed as creating any contract of employment or conferring upon any Participant any
right to continue in the employ or other service of the Company or limit in any way the right of the Company to change such person’s compensation or
other benefits or to terminate the employment or other service of such person with or without Cause.
7.9. Section Headings. The section headings contained herein are for convenience only, and in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather
than the section headings, will control.
7.10. Invalidity. If any term or provision contained herein is to any extent invalid or unenforceable, such term or provision will be reformed so that
it is valid, and such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or part hereof.
7.11. Applicable Law. The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan and any Award shall be
determined in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
7.12. Effective Date/Term. The Plan as most recently amended and restated became effective upon May 20, 2020, for the 2021 Plan Year. The Plan
shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms unless amended or terminated in accordance with Section 7.3.
7.13. Binding Effect. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be binding on any successor corporation or organization resulting from a
merger, consolidation or other reorganization of the Company, or upon any corporation or organization that succeeds to substantially all of the assets or
business of the Company.
7.14. Forfeiture Events. The Committee may specify in an Award that an Executive Officer’s rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an
Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment, in the reasonable discretion of the Committee, upon the occurrence of certain
specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance
4


================================================================================
[PAGE 177 OF 401]
================================================================================
conditions of an Award. Such events may include, but shall not be limited to, termination of the Executive Officer’s employment for cause, material
violation of material written policies of the Company, or breach of noncompetition, confidentiality, or other restrictive covenants that may apply to the
Executive Officer, as determined by the Committee in its reasonable discretion. In addition, if, as a result of an Executive Officer’s intentional misconduct
or gross negligence, as determined by the Committee in its reasonable discretion, the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the
material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the Committee may, in its reasonable
discretion, require the Executive Officer to promptly reimburse the Company for the amount of any payment previously received by the Executive Officer
pursuant to any Award that was earned or accrued during the twelve (12) month period following the earlier of the first public issuance or filing with the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission of any financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement that required such
accounting restatement. To the extent required by applicable law or the rules and regulations of the NYSE or other securities exchange on which the
Company’s common stock is listed or quoted and, in such case, if so required pursuant to a written policy adopted by the Company, Awards shall be subject
(including on a retroactive basis) to clawback, forfeiture or similar requirements (and such requirements shall be deemed incorporated by reference into all
outstanding Awards).

For purposes of the foregoing, (i) if both Moody’s and S&P shall not have in effect a rating for the Index Debt

established by Moody’s and S&P for the Index Debt shall fall within different Levels, the Applicable Rate shall be based on the
higher of the two ratings unless one of the two ratings is two or more Levels lower than the other, in which case the Applicable
Rate shall be determined by reference to the Level next below that of the higher of the two ratings; and (iii) if the ratings
established or deemed to have been established by Moody’s and S&P for the Index Debt shall be changed (other than as a result
of a change in the rating system of Moody’s or S&P), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced
by the applicable rating agency, irrespective of when notice of such

unavailability of ratings from such rating agencies, and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Rate
shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation. If either (but not both) of

or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDAR (if negative) attributable thereto for such Reference Period, and
(ii) if during such Reference Period the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary shall have made a Material Acquisition, Consolidated
EBITDAR for such Reference Period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (taking into account (A) such cost
savings as may be determined by the Parent Borrower in a manner consistent with the evaluation performed by the Parent
Borrower in deciding to make such Material Acquisition, as presented to the Parent Borrower’s board of directors, provided that
the Parent Borrower may take into account such cost savings only if it in good faith determines on the date of calculation that it is
reasonable to expect that such cost savings will be implemented within 120 days following the date of such Material Acquisition
(or in the case of any calculation made subsequent to such 120th day, that such cost savings have, in fact, been implemented) and
(B) all transactions that are directly related to such Material Acquisition and are entered into in connection and substantially
contemporaneously therewith) as if such Material Acquisition occurred on the first day of such Reference Period. As used in this
definition, “Material Acquisition” means any acquisition of property or other assets or series of related acquisitions of property
that (a) constitutes (i) assets comprising all or substantially all of a business or operating unit of a business, (ii) all or substantially

licenses of intellectual property by the Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and (b) involves the payment of consideration by the
Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries in excess of $25,000,000; “Material Disposition” means any Disposition of property or
series of related Dispositions of property that yields gross proceeds to the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of
$25,000,000. In making any calculation pursuant to this paragraph with respect to a Material Acquisition of a Person, business or
rights for which quarterly financial statements are not available, the Parent Borrower shall base such calculation on the financial
statements of such Person, business or rights for the then most recently completed period of 12 consecutive calendar months for
which such financial statements are available and shall deem the contribution of such Person, business or rights to Consolidated
EBITDAR for the period from the beginning of the applicable Reference Period to the date of such Material Acquisition to be
equal to the product of (x) the number of days in such period divided by 365 multiplied by (y) the amount of Consolidated
EBITDAR of such Person, business or rights for the 12-month period referred to above (calculated on the basis set forth in this
definition). In making any calculation pursuant to this paragraph in connection with an acquisition of Acquired Rights to be
followed by the granting of a new license of such Acquired Rights (or any rights derivative therefrom), effect may be given to
such grant of such new license (as if it had occurred on the date of such acquisition) if, and only if, the Parent Borrower in good
faith determines on the date of such calculation that it is reasonable to expect that such grant will be completed within 120 days
following the date of such acquisition (or in the case of any calculation made subsequent to such 120th day, that such grant has,
in fact, been completed).

entered into by the Parent Borrower (or the Parent Borrower and a Subsidiary) with, the applicable Issuing Bank relating to any
Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. The letters of credit identified on Schedule 2.04 shall
be deemed to be “Letters of Credit” issued on the Effective Date for all purposes of the Loan Documents. No Issuing Bank shall
at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the Issuing Bank or any
Lender to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Issuing Bank shall have any obligation hereunder to issue, or shall issue, any Letter of Credit the proceeds of which would be
made available to any Person (i) to fund any activity or business of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in any country or territory
that, at the time of such funding, is the subject of any Sanctions or (ii) in any manner that would result in a violation of any
Sanctions by any party to this Agreement.
(b)       Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a
Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Parent Borrower shall hand
deliver, telecopy or (pursuant to procedures approved by the applicable Issuing Bank) electronically transmit to the applicable
Issuing

Bank and, in the case of a Commercial Letter of Credit if the Administrative Agent shall have so requested and in the case of all
Standby Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent (in the case of (i) Letters of Credit denominated in dollars, reasonably in
advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, (ii) Letters of Credit denominated in Euros, prior to
12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension and (iii) Letters of Credit denominated in any Alternative Currencies other than Euros, prior to 12:00 noon, New York
City time, four Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting
the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date
of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, the currency in which such Letter of Credit is to be denominated (which shall be
dollars or, subject to Section 2.18, an Alternative Currency), the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other
information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit, provided that in no event shall any
Issuing Bank other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or one or more other Issuing Banks designated from time to time by the
Parent Borrower and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent issue any Alternative Currency Letter of Credit
hereunder. If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Parent Borrower (or the Parent Borrower and a Subsidiary) also shall
submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank’s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A
Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of
each Letter of Credit the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (i) the Dollar Equivalent of the LC Exposure with respect to Letters of Credit shall not exceed
$50,000,000 and (ii) the total Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the total Commitments. Subsequent to the receipt by
any Issuing Bank of a Notification Instruction (as defined below) from the Administrative Agent which shall not have been
withdrawn, such Issuing Bank will contact the Administrative Agent prior to the issuance or increase in any Letter of Credit to
determine whether or not such issuance or increase would result in any of the limitations set forth in the preceding sentence being
exceeded. For purposes of this Section 2.04(b), a “Notification Instruction” shall mean any instruction from the Administrative
Agent requiring that an Issuing Bank make the calculations described in the preceding sentence, which instruction the
Administrative Agent (i) may deliver at any time when it determines that the percentage which the aggregate Revolving Credit
Exposures constitutes of the aggregate Commitments then in effect is greater than 80% and (ii) will withdraw when it determines
that such percentage is equal to or less than 80%. For purposes of the third preceding sentence the amount of any Alternative
Currency Letter of Credit shall be the Dollar Equivalent thereof calculated on the basis of the applicable Exchange Rate
determined in accordance with Section 1.05.
(c)      Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the
date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year
after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date; provided that any Letter of
Credit may provide for the renewal thereof for additional periods not exceeding one year each pursuant to customary “evergreen”
provisions (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii)).

================================================================================
(d)      Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the
amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank
hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit
equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In
consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent in dollars, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of (i) each LC
Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank in dollars and (ii) the Dollar Equivalent, using the Exchange Rate at the time such
payment is made, of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank in an Alternative Currency and, in each case, not
reimbursed by the Parent Borrower (or a Subsidiary) on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any
reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Parent Borrower (or a Subsidiary) for any reason. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or
extension of any Letter of Credit, the occurrence and continuance of a Default or failure to satisfy any of the conditions set forth
in Article IV, the reduction or termination of the Commitments, any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that
such Lender may have against the Issuing Bank, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, any adverse
change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of any Borrower, any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by
the Borrower or any other Loan Party or any other Lender or any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or
not similar to any of the foregoing and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or
reduction whatsoever.
(e)      Reimbursement. If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the
Parent Borrower (or the Subsidiary that is jointly and severally liable with respect to such Letter of Credit) shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to such Issuing Bank an amount equal to such LC Disbursement in dollars, on the date that such LC
Disbursement is made (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on or before the next Business Day); provided that, if such LC
Disbursement is made under an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, automatically and with no further action required, the
Parent Borrower’s (or such Subsidiary’s) obligation to reimburse the applicable LC Disbursement shall be permanently converted
into an obligation to reimburse the Dollar Equivalent, calculated using the Exchange Rate at the time such payment is made, of
such LC Disbursement, and provided, further, that, in the case of any such reimbursement obligation which is in an amount of not
less than $500,000, the Parent Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with
Section 2.03 that such payment be financed in dollars with an ABR Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so
financed, the Parent Borrower’s (and such Subsidiary’s) obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the
resulting ABR Borrowing. If the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary) fails to make when due any reimbursement payment
required pursuant to this paragraph, the applicable Issuing Bank shall immediately notify the Administrative Agent, which shall
promptly notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the Dollar Equivalent thereof calculated in accordance with the
preceding sentence (if such LC Disbursement relates to an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit), the reimbursement payment
then due from the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary) in respect thereof and such Lender’s Applicable Percentage
45


================================================================================
[PAGE 224 OF 401]
================================================================================
thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender (other than such Issuing Bank) shall pay to the Administrative
Agent in dollars its Applicable Percentage of the reimbursement payment then due from the Parent Borrower (or such
Subsidiary), in the same manner as provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.05 shall
apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to such
Issuing Bank in dollars the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent
of any payment from the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary) pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall
distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any
payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the
funding of ABR Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Parent Borrower (and such
Subsidiary) of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
(f)      Letter of Credit Fees.
(i)       Commercial Letter of Credit Fee. The Parent Borrower (or the Subsidiary that is jointly and severally liable
with respect to the Letter of Credit in question) agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
applicable Issuing Bank and the Lenders, a Commercial Letter of Credit fee calculated at the rate per annum equal to the
Applicable Rate applicable to Commercial Letters of Credit from time to time in effect on the aggregate average daily
amount available to be drawn (calculated, in the case of any Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, on the basis of the
Dollar Equivalent thereof using the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date payment of such fee is due) under
each Commercial Letter of Credit issued hereunder. Commercial Letter of Credit Fees accrued through and including the
last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable in arrears on the fifth Business Day
following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. The Administrative Agent will
promptly pay to the Issuing Banks and the Lenders their pro rata shares of any amounts received from the Parent
Borrower (or such Subsidiary) in respect of any such fees. Commercial Letter of Credit fees shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).
(ii)       Standby Letter of Credit Fees. The Parent Borrower (or the Subsidiary that is jointly and severally liable
with respect to the Letter of Credit in question) agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
applicable Issuing Bank and the Lenders, a Standby Letter of Credit fee calculated at the rate per annum equal to the
Applicable Rate applicable to Eurocurrency Loans from time to time in effect on the aggregate average daily amount
available to be drawn (calculated, in the case of any Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, on the basis of the Dollar
Equivalent thereof using the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date payment of such fee is due) under each
Standby Letter of Credit issued hereunder (and in no event less than $500 with respect to each such Standby Letter of
Credit). Standby Letter of Credit Fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year shall be payable in arrears on the fifth Business Day following such last day, commencing on the
first such date to occur after the
46


================================================================================
[PAGE 225 OF 401]
================================================================================
date hereof. The Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing Banks and the Lenders their pro rata shares of
any amounts received from the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary) in respect of any such fees. Standby Letter of
Credit fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
(g)      Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Parent Borrower (or the Subsidiary that is jointly and severally
liable with respect to the Letter of Credit in question) to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section
shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit,
any application for the issuance of a Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other
document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein
being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against
presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or
circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section,
constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Parent Borrower’s (or such Subsidiary’s)
obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall
have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any
payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding
sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other
communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any
error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable Issuing
Bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 2.04(g) shall be construed to excuse such Issuing Bank, the Lenders
or the Administrative Agent from liability to the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary) to the extent of any direct damages (as
opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Parent
Borrower (and such Subsidiary) to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary)
that are caused by (x) such Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents
presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof or (y) the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of
such Issuing Bank, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent as found by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised
care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that,
with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of
Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility
for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
47


================================================================================
[PAGE 226 OF 401]
================================================================================
(h)   Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine
all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify
the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower (and the Subsidiary that is jointly and severally liable with respect to the
Letter of Credit in question, if applicable) in writing (by hand delivery, telecopy or (pursuant to procedures approved by the
Administrative Agent) electronic transmission) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will
make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Parent
Borrower (or the Subsidiary that is jointly and severally liable with respect to the Letter of Credit in question) of its obligation to
reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
(i)      Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Parent Borrower (or
the Subsidiary that is jointly and severally liable with respect to the Letter of Credit in question) shall reimburse such LC
Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, including by financing such payment obligation with an ABR
Loan in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on or prior to the next Business
Day), the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to
but excluding the date that the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary) reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum
then applicable to ABR Loans; provided that, if the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary) fails to reimburse such LC
Disbursement when due (including by financing such payment obligation with an ABR Loan) pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
Section, then Section 2.11(d) shall apply; and provided, further, that, in the case of an LC Disbursement made under an
Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, the amount of interest due with respect thereto shall accrue on the Dollar Equivalent,
calculated using the Exchange Rate at the time such LC Disbursement was made, of such LC Disbursement. Interest accrued
pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the
date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account
of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
(j)      Replacement and Resignation of any Issuing Bank. Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by
written agreement among the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing
Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of such Issuing Bank. At the time any such
replacement shall become effective, the Parent Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing
Bank pursuant to Section 2.04(f) and 2.10(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing
Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of such Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be
issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to include a reference to such successor or
to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the
replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all
the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such
replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or extend or otherwise amend an existing Letter of
Credit. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, any Issuing Bank may resign as an Issuing Bank
at any time upon 30 days’ prior written
48


================================================================================
[PAGE 227 OF 401]
================================================================================
notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders, in which case, such resigning Issuing Bank shall be replaced
in accordance with this Section.
(k)      Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the
Parent Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been
accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the then total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of
cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Parent Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the
name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in dollars and in cash equal to the LC Exposure
as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that (i) the portions of such amount attributable to
undrawn Alternative Currency Letters of Credit shall be deposited in the applicable Alternative Currencies in the actual amounts
of such undrawn Letters of Credit and (ii) the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and
such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default with respect to the Parent Borrower described in paragraph  (h) or (i) of Article VII. Each deposit pursuant to
this paragraph shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the
Parent Borrower (and any Subsidiary for whose account a Letter of Credit has been issued) under this Agreement. The
Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.
Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole
discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Parent Borrower’s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.
Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed (to be
applied ratably among them according to the respective aggregate amounts of the then unreimbursed LC Disbursements) and, to
the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Parent Borrower (and each
such Subsidiary) for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent
of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the then total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other
obligations of the Parent Borrower (and each such Subsidiary) under this Agreement. If the Parent Borrower is required to
provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default or, in accordance with Section
2.09(c), the total Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding 105% of the total Commitments, such amount (to the extent not applied
as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Parent Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or
waived or, as the case may be, the total Revolving Credit Exposure not exceeding the total Commitments.
(l)      Additional Issuing Banks. The Parent Borrower may, at any time and from time to time with the consent of
the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such Lender, designate one or more additional
Lenders to act as an issuing bank under the terms of this Agreement, provided that the total number of Issuing Banks at any time
shall not exceed four. Any Lender designated as Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph (l) shall be deemed to be an “Issuing
Bank” for the purposes of this Agreement (in addition to being a Lender) with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Lender.
49


================================================================================
[PAGE 228 OF 401]
================================================================================
(m)      Reporting. Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise agrees, each Issuing Bank will report in writing to
the Administrative Agent, with a copy to the Parent Borrower, (i) on the first Business Day of each week and on the second
Business Day to occur after the last day of each March, June, September and December, and on such other dates as the
Administrative Agent may reasonably request, the daily activity during the preceding week, calendar quarter or other period, as
the case may be, with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it, including the aggregate outstanding LC Exposure with respect to
such Letters of Credit on each day during such week, quarter or other period, in such form and detail as shall be satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent, (ii) on any Business Day on which the Parent Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement
required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such failure and the amount of such LC Disbursement
and (iii) such other information with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably request.
SECTION 2.05.      Funding of Borrowings. (a)  Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on
the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon., New York City time, to the account of
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that if an ABR
Borrowing is requested for disbursement on the same day after 11:00 a.m., New York time, then each Lender shall make the Loan
to be made by it hereunder in such manner by 3:00 p.m., New York City time. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans
available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the applicable
Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent and designated by the Parent Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request;
provided that ABR Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.04(e) shall be
remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.
(b)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed time of any
Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available at such time in accordance with paragraph (a)
of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In
such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the
date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative
Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. If such Lender pays such amount to the
Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. If such Lender’s share
of such Borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after the date
such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Parent Borrower
and any other applicable Borrower of such failure and shall also be entitled to recover such amount from the applicable Borrower,
on demand, with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans hereunder accruing from the date of such
Borrowing. If the Parent Borrower or the applicable Borrower shall pay to
50


================================================================================
[PAGE 229 OF 401]
================================================================================
the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, the Parent Borrower and such applicable Borrower shall have no further
obligations to such Lender with respect to such amount.
SECTION 2.06.      Interest Elections. (a)  Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) may elect to convert
such Borrowing (i) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in dollars, to an ABR Borrowing; or (ii) in the case of
an ABR Borrowing, to a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in dollars or to continue such Borrowing in the same currency
and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Parent
Borrower (on behalf of itself or any other Borrower) may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected
Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such
Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
(b)      To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of another
Borrower) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by hand delivery, telecopy or electronic transmission (pursuant
to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent) to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form
approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Parent Borrower by the time that a Borrowing Request would be
required under Section 2.03 if the Parent Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be
made on the effective date of such election. Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable.
(c)      Each Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i)       the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected
with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case
the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii)       the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a
Business Day;
(iii)       whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
51


================================================================================
[PAGE 230 OF 401]
================================================================================
(iv)       if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after
giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Parent
Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of another Borrower) shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one
month’s duration.
(d)      Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each
Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e)      If the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of another Borrower) fails to deliver a timely Interest
Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless
such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing (i) if denominated in dollars, shall
be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) if denominated in an Alternative Currency, shall be converted to a one month Interest
Period denominated in the same currency as the Eurocurrency Borrowing being continued. Notwithstanding any contrary
provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the
Required Lenders, so notifies the Parent Borrower, then, so long as such Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding
Borrowing denominated in dollars may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each
Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto.
(f)      By entering into this Agreement, the parties hereto have assumed in good faith that the interest payable at
the rates specified in this Agreement is not and will not be subject to any Tax deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax.
Nevertheless, if a Tax deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax is required by Swiss law to be made by a Swiss Borrower
in respect of any interest payable by it under a Loan Document and should it be unlawful for a Swiss Borrower to comply with
Section 2.15 for any reason, and if the gross-up in accordance with Section 2.15 is effectively not paid: (i) the applicable interest
rate in relation to that interest payment shall be (A) the interest rate which would have applied to that interest payment in the
absence of this Section 2.06(f)), divided by (B) one minus the rate at which the relevant deduction on account of Swiss
Withholding Tax is required to be made (where the rate at which the relevant deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax is
required to be made is for this purpose expressed as a fraction of one rather than as a percentage); (ii) (A) a Swiss Borrower shall
be obliged to pay the relevant interest at the adjusted rate as set forth in this Section 2.06(f), and (B) a Swiss Borrower shall make
the deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax (within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law) on the
interest so recalculated; and (iii) all references to a rate of interest under a Loan Document applicable to a Swiss Borrower shall
be construed accordingly. To the extent that interest payable by a Swiss Borrower under this Agreement becomes subject to a
deduction of Swiss Withholding Tax, each relevant Lender and the Swiss Borrower shall promptly cooperate in completing any
procedural formalities (including submitting forms and documents required by the appropriate Tax authority) to the extent
possible and necessary for the Swiss Borrower to obtain authorization to make interest payments without them being subject to
such deduction of Swiss Withholding Tax or to reduce the applicable withholding tax rate. If a Swiss
52


================================================================================
[PAGE 231 OF 401]
================================================================================
Borrower pays the interest recalculated under this Section 2.06(f), the Swiss Borrower shall cooperate with each relevant Lender
to enable that Lender to receive a full or partial refund of the Swiss Withholding Tax under an applicable double taxation treaty.
In the event Swiss Withholding Tax is refunded to a Lender by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, the relevant Lender shall
immediately forward such amount to the Swiss Borrower. This Section 2.06(f) shall not apply and no interest shall be
recalculated pursuant to this Section 2.06(f) if a deduction of Swiss Withholding Tax is due as a result of any non-compliance by
a Lender with the provisions of Section 10.04 or the Lender (i) making a misrepresentation as to its status according to Section
1.07 as a Swiss Qualifying Bank or as (only) one Swiss Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank or (ii) ceasing to be a Swiss Qualifying
Bank or as (only) one Swiss Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank after the time it acceded to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) a Lender who is not treated as not being a Swiss Qualifying Bank
shall not be under any obligation to change its status into a Swiss Qualifying Bank, (ii) the documentation which a Lender
executes on becoming a party hereto shall not be invalidated by any failure of a Lender to comply with this Section 2.06(f),
Section 10.04 or Section 1.07 and (iii) none of the Loan Documents shall be invalidated by any failure of a Lender to comply
with this Section 2.06(f), Section 10.04(b)(i)(A) or Section 1.07 or indicates its status as a Swiss Qualifying Bank or Swiss
Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank as unknown.
SECTION 2.07.      Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a)  Unless previously terminated in accordance
with this Agreement, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
(b)      The Parent Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; provided
that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than
$1,000,000, or, if less than $1,000,000, the remaining amount of the total Commitments, and (ii) the Parent Borrower shall not
terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with
Section 2.09, the total Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.
(c)      The Parent Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the
Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least two Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or
reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative
Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Parent Borrower pursuant to this Section
shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Parent Borrower may state that
such notice is conditioned upon another event, such as the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may
be revoked by the Parent Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the
Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
53


================================================================================
[PAGE 232 OF 401]
================================================================================
SECTION 2.08.      Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a)  Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises
to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan made to such
Borrower on the Maturity Date.
(b)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender to such Borrower, including the
amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(c)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain a Register pursuant to Section 10.04(b)(iv) and an account for each
Lender in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type and currency thereof and the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the
account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.
(d)      The entries made in the accounts and Register maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section
shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of
any Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(e)      Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the
applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or,
if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent.
Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment
pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named
therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
SECTION 2.09.      Prepayment of Loans. (a)  Each Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to
time to prepay voluntarily any Borrowing made to such Borrower in whole or in part without premium or penalty, subject to prior
notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.
(b)      The Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) shall notify the Administrative
Agent in writing (by hand delivery, telecopy or (pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent) electronic
transmission) of any voluntary prepayment hereunder prior to (i) in the case of ABR Loans, 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on
such date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in dollars, 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the
Business Day immediately preceding such date of prepayment, (iii) in the case of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Euros,
12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business Days prior to such date of prepayment and (iv) in the case of Eurocurrency
Loans denominated in any Alternative Currencies other than Euros, 12:00 noon, New York City time, four Business Days prior to
such date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of
each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid
54


================================================================================
[PAGE 233 OF 401]
================================================================================
and whether the prepayment is of Eurocurrency Loans, ABR Loans or a combination thereof, and, if of a combination thereof, the
amount allocable to each; provided that, if a notice of voluntary prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of
termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.07, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice
of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.07. Promptly following receipt of any such notice the Administrative
Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial voluntary prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an
aggregate principal amount of $500,000 or a multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or the Dollar Equivalent thereof). Each
voluntary prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.
(c)      If on any Exchange Rate Date the Administrative Agent determines that the total Revolving Credit Exposure
exceeds 105% of the total Commitments, the Borrowers shall within three Business Days after such date, prepay Loans and/or
deposit cash collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent established and maintained in accordance with Section
2.04(k) in an aggregate amount such that, after deducting therefrom the amount so prepaid and/or so deposited in such account,
the total Revolving Credit Exposure does not exceed the total Commitments. The Administrative Agent shall promptly release
any collateral theretofore deposited with it pursuant to this Section 2.09 to the extent that on any Exchange Rate Date the total
Revolving Credit Exposure does not exceed the total Commitments.
(d)      Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.11 and any
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14.
SECTION 2.10.      Fees. (a)  The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
each Lender a commitment fee for the period from and including the Effective Date to the last day of the Availability Period,
computed at the Applicable Rate on the average daily amount of the Available Commitment of such Lender during the period for
which payment is made. Commitment fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December
of each year shall be payable on the fifth Business Day following such last day, commencing on October 7, 2019; provided that
all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on
which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
(b)      The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing Bank the fees agreed upon by the Parent Borrower with
such Issuing Bank with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of
drawings thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, in any case where, in accordance with the second sentence of the definition of
Issuing Bank, an Issuing Bank arranges for one or more Letters of Credit to be issued by an Affiliate of such Issuing Bank, the
fees agreed upon by such Issuing Bank with the Parent Borrower shall be deemed to have been agreed upon by such Affiliate
unless the Parent Borrower and such Affiliate otherwise agree.
55


================================================================================
[PAGE 234 OF 401]
================================================================================
(c)      The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the
amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
(d)      All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the
Administrative Agent (or to each Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees
and participation fees, to the Lenders. Except as may be expressly agreed in writing between the Parent Borrower and the
Administrative Agent with respect to fees to the Administrative Agent, fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances
(other than in the case, and to the extent, of any overpayment thereof by the applicable Borrower).
SECTION 2.11.      Interest; Eurocurrency Tranches. (a)  The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear
interest (i) prior to the Ratings-Based Pricing Toggle Date, at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate and (ii) on and
after the Ratings-Based Pricing Toggle Date, at the Alternate Base Rate.
(b)      The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the
Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
(c)      The interest rate for Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies shall be subject to customary adjustments
if and to the extent loans denominated in such Alternative Currencies are not customarily priced on a LIBO Rate basis; provided,
however that such adjustments shall not apply to Loans denominated in Euros, Yen or Hong Kong Dollars.
(d)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount
payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue
principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section
or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
(e)      Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and
upon termination of all of the Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be
payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan
prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date
of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the
current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
(f)      All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by
reference to (i) the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate or (ii) the LIBO Rate or
Interpolated Rate at times when the LIBO Rate or Interpolated Rate is based on the HKD Screen Rate shall be computed on the
basis
56


================================================================================
[PAGE 235 OF 401]
================================================================================
of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall
be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.12.      Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a
Eurocurrency Borrowing:
(a)      the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error) that by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate (including because the LIBO Screen Rate is not available or
published on a current basis), as applicable, for such Interest Period; or
(b)      the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO
Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of
making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of
any other Borrower) and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative
Agent notifies the Parent Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any
Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency
Borrowing shall be ineffective, (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in dollars, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing; provided that (A) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one
Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted and (B) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice
affect only one currency, then Borrowings in other permitted currencies shall be permitted. The Administrative Agent agrees to
give prompt notice to the Parent Borrower when the circumstances that gave rise to a notice under this Section 2.12 no longer
exist. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i)
the circumstances set forth in clause (a) have arisen and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or (ii) the circumstances
set forth in clause (a) have not arisen but either (w) the supervisor for the administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate has made a
public statement that the administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate is insolvent (and there is no successor administrator that will
continue publication of the LIBO Screen Rate), (x) the administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate has made a public statement
identifying a specific date after which the LIBO Screen Rate will permanently or indefinitely cease to be published by it (and
there is no successor administrator that will continue publication of the LIBO Screen Rate), (y) the supervisor for the
administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the LIBO Screen Rate
will permanently or indefinitely cease to be published or (z) the supervisor for the administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate or a
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific
date after which the LIBO Screen Rate may no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, then the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower shall enter into an amendment to establish an alternate rate of interest to the LIBO Rate that gives due
consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining
57


================================================================================
[PAGE 236 OF 401]
================================================================================
a rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States at such time and such other related changes to this Agreement as may
be applicable (but for the avoidance of doubt, such related changes shall not include a reduction of the Applicable Rate);
provided that, if such alternate rate of interest as so determined would be less than 0.75%, such rate shall be deemed to be 0.75%
for the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.02, such amendment shall become
effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the Administrative Agent shall not
have received, within five Business Days of the date notice of such alternate rate of interest is provided to the Lenders, a written
notice from the Required Lenders stating that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. Until an alternate rate of interest
shall be determined in accordance with this paragraph (but, in the case of the circumstances described in clauses (w), (x) or (y)
above, only to the extent the LIBO Screen Rate for the applicable currency and such Interest Period is not available or published
at such time on a current basis), (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a
Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing. The LIBO Rate is
derived from the London interbank offered rate. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which
contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to
make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator,
the “IBA”) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022,
the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon
which to determine the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry
initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank
offered rate. In the event that the London interbank offered rate is no longer available or in certain other circumstances, this
Section provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. However, the Administrative Agent does not
warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any
other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of “LIBO Rate” or with respect to any
alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof.
SECTION 2.13.      Increased Costs. (a)  If any Change in Law shall:
(i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of,
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in
the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank;
58


================================================================================
[PAGE 237 OF 401]
================================================================================
(ii)       impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting
this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; or
(iii)       shall subject the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank to any Taxes (other than (A)
Indemnified Taxes indemnified under Section 2.15, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (f) of the definition of
Excluded Taxes or (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other
obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender (or in the case of (iii) to such Administrative
Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank) of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make such
Loan) or to increase the cost to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or
maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the Administrative Agent, such
Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Parent Borrower will pay to the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, upon demand of such Person, such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such
additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)      If any Lender or any Issuing Bank reasonably determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or
liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s capital
(or on the capital of any corporation controlling such Lender or such Issuing Bank) as a consequence of this Agreement or the
Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank,
to a level below that which such Lender or such controlling corporation could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking
into consideration such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s or such controlling corporation’s policies with respect to capital
adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time the Parent Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may
be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such controlling corporation for
any such reduction suffered.
(c)      A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate
such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a), (b) or (e) of this Section, containing (i) a
reasonably detailed explanation of the basis on which such amount or amounts were calculated and the Change in Law by reason
of which it has become entitled to be so compensated and (ii) confirmation of the matters set forth in the last sentence of Section
2.13(d), shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. No Lender or Issuing Bank shall
be entitled to the benefits of this Section 2.13 unless such Lender or Issuing Bank shall have complied with the requirements of
this Section 2.13. The Parent Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due
on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
59


================================================================================
[PAGE 238 OF 401]
================================================================================
(d)      Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this
Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that
the Parent Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased
costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
notifies the Parent Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or such
Issuing Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.13, no Lender or Issuing Bank shall demand
compensation for any increased costs or reduction referred to above in this Section if it shall not then be the general policy of
such Lender to demand such compensation in similar circumstances from comparable borrowers under comparable provisions of
other credit agreements, if any (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that a waiver by any Lender or Issuing Bank in
any given case of its right to demand such compensation from any given borrower shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to
constitute a change in the general policy of such Lender).
(e)      If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan to a Subsidiary Borrower that is a Foreign
Subsidiary is increased (or the amount of any sum received or receivable by any Lender or its lending office is reduced) by an
amount deemed by such Lender to be material, by reason of the fact that such Subsidiary Borrower is a Foreign Subsidiary, such
Subsidiary Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for such increased cost or reduction within 15 days after demand by such
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), which such Lender shall make within 90 days from the day such Lender has
notice of such increased cost or reduction.
SECTION 2.14.      Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency
Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the
conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan into an ABR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c)
the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant
hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.09(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or
(d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a
request by the Parent Borrower pursuant to Section 2.17, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate each
Lender for the loss and reasonable cost and expense attributable to such event (excluding loss of margin). In the case of a
Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount reasonably determined by
such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan
had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the
date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or
continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would
accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the
commencement of such period, for deposits in the applicable currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in
the applicable eurocurrency market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled
to receive pursuant to this Section,
60


================================================================================
[PAGE 239 OF 401]
================================================================================
containing a reasonably detailed calculation of such amounts, shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower and shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10
days after receipt thereof. No Lender or Issuing Bank shall be entitled to the benefits of this Section 2.14 unless such Lender or
Issuing Bank shall have complied with the requirements of this Section 2.14.
SECTION 2.15.      Taxes. (a)   Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under
any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If
any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or
withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to
make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan
Party shall be increased as necessary so that, after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and
withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15), the amounts received with respect to this agreement
equal the sum which would have been received had no such deduction or withholding been made.The Loan Parties shall timely
pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent
timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.
(c)      Each Loan Party shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and any Issuing Bank, as promptly
as possible but in any event within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any
payment by or on account of any obligation of such Loan Party under any Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and including any penalties, interest and
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment
or liability, together with, to the extent available, a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing
such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to such Loan Party, delivered to such Loan Party as soon
as practicable after any such payment by a Lender or any Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on
behalf of a Lender or any Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)      As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a
Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence
of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e)      A payment to a Lender shall not be increased under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.15 and no
indemnification is due under paragraph (c) of this Section 2.15 if on the date on which the payment falls due the payment could
have been made without any deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax (i) had the Lender correctly declared its status as to
whether it is a Swiss Qualifying Bank, (ii) had the Lender complied with the assignment, transfer or exposure

transfer restrictions pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) had the Lender not ceased to be a Swiss Qualifying Bank, or (iv) had the
Swiss Non-Bank Rules not been breached as a result of an assignment or transfer of rights and obligations under this Agreement
after the occurrence of an Event of Default.
(f)      (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax, with respect to
payments made under this Agreement or any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and
executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such
Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set
forth in Section 2.15(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such
completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would
materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii)       Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person,
(A)      any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or
prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon
the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that
such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(B)      any Lender that is not a U.S. Person shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the
date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable
request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty
and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, the applicable IRS Form W-8 establishing an

(iii)     in the case of Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section
881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Lender is not a “bank” within
the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section
881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of the applicable IRS Form W-8; or to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not
the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, the applicable IRS Form W-
8, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other
certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if such Lender is a partnership and one or more
direct or indirect partners of such Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Lender may provide a U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C)      any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which
such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for
claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such
supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent
to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D)      If a payment made to a Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document would be subject to
U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting
requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable, or those
under an intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of Sections 1471 through 1474
of the Code), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by
law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation
prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional
documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has
complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such
payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.15(f)(ii)(D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA
after the date of this Credit Agreement.

Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any
respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its
legal inability to do so.
(g)      Each Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full
amount of any Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority, together with any reasonable costs and expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, that are attributable (i) to such Lender and that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent and (ii) to
a Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.
(h)      If the Administrative Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Bank determines that it has received a refund which, in
the good faith judgment of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, is allocable to any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan Party has
paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.15, it shall promptly pay over such refund to such Loan Party (but only to the
extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 2.15 with respect to the
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative
Agent or such Lender or such Issuing Bank and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that such Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such
Lender or such Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other
charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority attributable to such amount (including the reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses described above of the Administrative Agent or such Lender or such Issuing Bank)) to the Administrative Agent or
such Lender or such Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender or such Issuing Bank is required to repay
such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any
Lender or an Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems
confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.
(i)      For purposes of this Section, the term “Lender” includes any Issuing Bank and the term “applicable law”
includes FATCA.
SECTION 2.16.      Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.  (a)  Each Borrower shall make
each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or
of amounts payable under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when
due, in immediately available funds, without set‑off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in
the discretion of the Administrative Agent or an Issuing Bank, as applicable, be deemed to have been received on the next
succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative
Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, 7th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60603-2300 and to the wire instructions of the
Administrative Agent set forth in Section 9.06 (or such other address or wire instructions of the Administrative Agent that may
be provided from time to time by the Administrative Agent), except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank as expressly
64


================================================================================
[PAGE 243 OF 401]
================================================================================
provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person
to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a
Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment
accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in
dollars except (i) payments of principal of and interest on any Alternative Currency Loan shall be paid in the applicable currency
and (ii) as provided in Section 2.04(k).
(b)      If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all
amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest, fees, expenses and other amounts then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest, fees, expenses and other amounts then due hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest, fees, expenses and other amounts then due to such parties, and
(ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amounts received from any Guarantor shall be applied to Excluded Swap Obligations of such
Guarantor.
(c)      If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set‑off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in
respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender
receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and
accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall
purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the
extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate
amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; provided that (i) if
any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations
shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this
paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in
any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the applicable Borrower or
any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply), or any payment obtained pursuant to
a court order. Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law,
that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of
set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in
the amount of such participation.

================================================================================
(d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will
not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in
accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may
be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to
such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it
to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e)      If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(d) or (e),
2.05(b) or 2.16(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply
any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations
under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
(f)      In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Subsidiary Borrower hereby
appoints the Parent Borrower to act as agent on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower for the purpose of (i) giving any notices or
requests contemplated to be given by such Subsidiary Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation,
Borrowing Requests, prepayment notices and Interest Election Requests and (ii) paying on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower
any Subsidiary Obligations owing by such Subsidiary Borrower; provided, that each Subsidiary Borrower shall retain the right, in
its discretion, to give directly any or all of such notices or requests or to make directly any or all of such payments.
(g)      The obligations of each Borrower under this Agreement are several although the Subsidiary Obligations are
guaranteed by the Parent Borrower under Article IX.
SECTION 2.17.      Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a)  If any Lender (including any Issuing
Bank) requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender
(including any Issuing Bank) or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender (including any Issuing Bank)
pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or
booking its Loans (or interests in Letters of Credit) hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its
offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender (including any Issuing Bank), such designation or assignment (i)
would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not
subject such Lender (including any Issuing Bank) to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender (including any Issuing Bank).
(b)      If (i) any Lender (including any Issuing Bank) requests compensation under Section 2.13, (ii) any Borrower
is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender (including any Issuing Bank) or any Governmental Authority for the
account of any Lender (including any Issuing Bank) pursuant to Section 2.15, (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (iv) any
Lender

does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, modification, consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document that requires the consent of each of the Lenders or each of the Lenders affected thereby (so long as the
consent of the Required Lenders (with the percentage in such definition being deemed to be 66 2/3% for this purpose) has been
obtained), then the Parent Borrower may, at its sole expense (in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of this Section 2.17(b) only),
upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04, provided that the Parent Borrower shall be required to
pay the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 10.04(b)(ii)(C), or pursuant to deemed assignment provisions
established by the Administrative Agent to which the Parent Borrower has previously consented in writing), all its interests,
rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Parent Borrower shall have received the prior written consent
of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of
an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon,
accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and
accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) (and, if such Lender is an Issuing Bank, all Letters
of Credit issued by it shall have been cancelled or other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank shall have
been made with respect to such Letters of Credit), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will result in a
reduction in such compensation or payments and (iv) in the case of an assignment pursuant to clause (iv) above, no Default shall
have occurred and be continuing. A Lender (including any Issuing Bank) shall not be required to make any such assignment and
delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Parent Borrower to
require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. No such assignment shall be deemed to be a waiver of any rights which
any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.
SECTION 2.18.      Change in Law. If (a) any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for any Issuing Bank to issue
Letters of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency or (b) there shall have occurred any change in national or international
financial, political or economic conditions (including the imposition of or any change in exchange controls) or currency exchange
rates that would make it impracticable for any Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit denominated in such Alternative Currency,
then by prompt written notice thereof to the Parent Borrower and to the Administrative Agent (which notice shall promptly be
withdrawn whenever such circumstances no longer exist), such Issuing Bank may declare that Letters of Credit will not thereafter
be issued by it in the affected Alternative Currency or Alternative Currencies, whereupon the affected Alternative Currency or
Alternative Currencies shall be deemed (until such notice is withdrawn) not to constitute an Alternative Currency for purposes of
the issuance of Letters of Credit by such Issuing Bank.
67


================================================================================
[PAGE 246 OF 401]
================================================================================
SECTION 2.19.      Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting
Lender:
(a)      fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Available Commitment of such Defaulting Lender
pursuant to Section 2.10(a);
(b)      the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in
determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any
amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.02); provided, that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a
Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of each Lender or each
Lender affected thereby;
(c)      if any LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i)       all or any part of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-
Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments but only to the extent the sum of all non-
Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure does not exceed the total
of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Commitments;
(ii)       if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Parent
Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent cash collateralize for the benefit
of the Issuing Bank only such Borrower’s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure (after
giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.04(k) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii)       if the Parent Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant
to clause (ii) above, the Parent Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 2.04(f) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s LC
Exposure is cash collateralized;
(iv)       if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees
payable to the Lenders pursuant to Sections 2.10(a) and 2.04(f) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting
Lenders’ Commitment; and
(v)       if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized
pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other
Lender hereunder, all fees payable under Section 2.04(f) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure shall be
payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash
collateralized; and
68


================================================================================
[PAGE 247 OF 401]
================================================================================
(d)      so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase
any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender’s then outstanding LC Exposure will
be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the applicable
Borrower in accordance with Section 2.19(c), and participating interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be
allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.19(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not
participate therein).
If (i) a Bankruptcy Event or a Bail-In Action with respect to a Parent of any Lender shall occur following the date
hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted
in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Issuing Bank
shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have
entered into arrangements with the Parent Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to the Issuing Bank to defease any risk to it in
respect of such Lender hereunder.
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Parent Borrower and the Issuing Bank each agrees, acting in good
faith and a commercially reasonable manner, that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such
Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such
Lender’s Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the
Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its
Commitment.
SECTION 2.20.      Extension of Maturity Date.
(a)    Request for Extension. The Parent Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly
notify the Lenders) not earlier than 60 days and not later than 30 days prior to the Maturity Date then in effect hereunder (the
“Existing Maturity Date”), request that each Lender extend such Lender’s Maturity Date for an additional 364 days from the
Existing Maturity Date; provided, however, that the Parent Borrower may not request more than two such extensions pursuant to
this Section 2.20.
(b)    Lender Elections to Extend. Each Lender, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by notice to the
Administrative Agent given not earlier than 45 days prior to the Existing Maturity Date and not later than the date (the “Notice
Date”) that is 15 days prior to the Existing Maturity Date, advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to
such extension (and each Lender that determines not to so extend its Maturity Date (a “Non‑Extending Lender”) shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Notice Date) and any
Lender that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non‑Extending
Lender. The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree.
(c)    Notification by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Parent Borrower of each
Lender’s determination under this Section 2.20 no later than the date 15 days prior to the Existing Maturity Date (or, if such date
is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day).
69


================================================================================
[PAGE 248 OF 401]
================================================================================
(d)    Additional Commitment Lenders. The Parent Borrower shall have the right on or before the Existing Maturity
Date to replace each Non‑Extending Lender with, and add as “Lenders” under this Agreement in place thereof, one or more
Eligible Assignees (each, an “Additional Commitment Lender”) as provided in Section 10.04 each of which Additional
Commitment Lenders shall have entered into an Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which such Additional Commitment
Lender shall, effective as of the Existing Maturity Date, undertake a Commitment (and, if any such Additional Commitment
Lender is already a Lender, its Commitment shall be in addition to such Lender’s Commitment hereunder on such date).
(e)    Minimum Extension Requirement. If (and only if) the total of the Commitments of the Lenders that have
agreed so to extend their Maturity Dates and the additional Commitments of the Additional Commitment Lenders shall be more
than 50% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the Existing Maturity Date, then, effective
as of the Existing Maturity Date, the Maturity Date of each Extending Lender and of each Additional Commitment Lender shall
be extended to the date falling 364 days after the Existing Maturity Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such
Commitment Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Lender shall
thereupon become a “Lender” for all purposes of this Agreement.
(f)    Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an extension of the Maturity Date
pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall not be effective with respect to any Lender unless:
(i)    At the time of and immediately after giving effect to such extension, no Default shall have occurred
and be continuing;
(ii)    The representations and warranties made by any Loan Party in or pursuant to the Loan Documents
shall be true and correct in all material respects (or, in the case of any representation and warranty qualified by materiality,
in all respects) on and as of the date of such extension (other than such representations as are made as of a specific earlier
date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier
date (or, in the case of any representation and warranty qualified by materiality, in all respects as of such earlier date); and
(iii)    On or before the then applicable Existing Maturity Date, (1) the Borrowers shall have paid in full the
principal of and interest on all of the Loans made by each Non-Extending Lender to the Borrowers hereunder and (2) the
Borrowers shall have paid in full all other amounts owing to such Non-Extending Lender hereunder.
(g)    Amendment; Sharing of Payments. In connection with any extension of the Maturity Date, the Borrowers, the
Administrative Agent and each extending Lender may make such amendments to this Agreement as the Administrative Agent
determines to be reasonably necessary to evidence the extension. This Section shall supersede Sections 2.16 and 10.02.

ARTICLE III
Representations and Warranties
The Parent Borrower represents and warrants and each Subsidiary Borrower represents and warrants (to the extent
specifically applicable to such Subsidiary Borrower) to the Lenders that:
SECTION 3.01.      Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrowers, the Guarantors and the Parent Borrower’s
Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Regulation S-X, part 210.1-02 of Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations) is duly
organized, validly existing and, other than the Swiss Loan Party, in good standing (or, if applicable in a foreign jurisdiction,
enjoys the equivalent status under the laws of any jurisdiction of organization outside the United States of America) under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and,
except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.
SECTION 3.02.      Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions are within each Loan Party’s corporate powers
and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required, stockholder action. Each Loan Document has been
duly executed and delivered by each Loan Party which is a party thereto and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
such Loan Party, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
liquidation, reconstruction, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles of
equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all
indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in
the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing.
(b)   The Parent Borrower has implemented and maintains in effect policies and procedures designed to ensure
compliance by the Parent Borrower, its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents with Anti-
Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions, and the Parent Borrower, its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Parent
Borrower, their respective officers, employees, directors and agents, are in compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable
Sanctions in all material respects and are not knowingly engaged in any activity that would reasonably be expected to result in
Parent Borrower being designated as a Sanctioned Person. None of (a) the Parent Borrower, any Subsidiary or, to the knowledge
of the Parent Borrower, any of their respective directors, officers or employees, or (b) to the knowledge of the Parent Borrower,
any agent of the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary that will act in any capacity in connection with or benefit from the credit

each Plan is in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the provisions of the Code relating to Plans and the
regulations and published interpretations thereunder, and each Foreign Plan is in compliance with applicable non-United States
law and regulations thereunder, and (ii) no ERISA Event or Foreign Plan Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur
that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events and Foreign Plan Events for which liability has been imposed or is
reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all
accumulated benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Accounting Standards

such amounts, exceed by more than $10,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the present value of all
accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Accounting Standards

any Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or hereafter
delivered hereunder or reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (as modified or supplemented
by other information so furnished prior to the date on which this representation and warranty is made or deemed made) do not
contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information,
the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiary Borrowers represent only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time. As of the Effective Date, to the best knowledge of the Parent Borrower, the
information included in the Beneficial Ownership Certification provided by a Borrower on or prior to the Effective Date to any
Lender in connection with this Agreement is true and correct in all respects.
SECTION 3.12.      Subsidiary Guarantors. Set forth on Schedule 3.12 is a list of each Subsidiary which, in

their respective officers and directors and to the knowledge of the Borrowers their employees and agents, are in compliance in all
material respects with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions and are not knowingly engaged in any activity that would
reasonably be expected to result in a Borrower being designated as a Sanctioned Person. None of (a) the Borrowers, any
Subsidiary, any of their respective directors or officers or to the knowledge of the Borrowers or such Subsidiary employees, or (b)
to the knowledge of the Borrowers, any agent of a Borrower or any Subsidiary that will act in any capacity in connection with or
benefit from the credit facility established hereby, is a Sanctioned Person. No Borrowing or Letter of Credit, use of proceeds or
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement will violate any Anti-Corruption Law or applicable Sanctions. The foregoing
representations in this Section 3.13 will not apply to any party hereto to which Council Regulation (EC) 2271/96 (the “Blocking
Regulation”) applies, if and to the extent that such representations are or would be unenforceable by or in respect of that party
pursuant to, or would otherwise result in a breach and/or violation of, (i) any provision of the Blocking Regulation (or any law or
regulation implementing the Blocking Regulation in any member state of the European Union) or (ii) any similar blocking or
anti-boycott law in the United Kingdom.

SECTION 3.15.      Plan Assets; Prohibited Transactions. None of the Borrowers or any of their subsidiaries is an
entity deemed to hold “plan assets” (within the meaning of the Plan Asset Regulations), and neither the execution, delivery nor
performance of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including the making of any Loan and the issuance of any
Letter of Credit hereunder, will give rise to a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code.

of their important activities, in the business of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock, or extending credit for the purpose of

be used to buy or carry any Margin Stock. Following the application of the proceeds of each Borrowing or drawing under each
Letter of Credit, not more than 25% of the value of the assets (either of the Borrowers only or of the Borrowers and their
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis) will be Margin Stock.
SECTION 3.17.     Compliance with Swiss Non-Bank Rules. (a) Subject to clause (b) below, each Swiss Borrower
represents that it is at all times in compliance with the Swiss Non-Bank Rules; provided, that, if at any time the aggregate number
of Lenders which are not Swiss Qualifying Banks is less than ten in the aggregate, then for the purposes of determining
compliance with the Swiss 20-Non-Bank Rule pursuant to this Section 3.16, the relevant Swiss Borrower shall assume that the
aggregate number of not Swiss Qualifying Banks hereunder is 10. (b) A Swiss Borrower shall not be in breach of its obligations
under clause (a) above if a Swiss Non-Bank Rule is breached as a result of one or more Lenders (i) making a misrepresentation as
to its status according to Section 1.07 as a Swiss Qualifying Bank or as (only) one Swiss Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank or (ii)
ceasing to be a Swiss Qualifying Bank or as (only) one Swiss Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank after the time it acceded to this
Agreement.
SECTION 3.18.     Additional Specified Stimulus Indebtedness. The Parent Borrower hereby represents and
warrants that it and/or its applicable Subsidiaries have determined in good faith in consultation with counsel that it and/or such
Subsidiaries are eligible to participate in all Additional Specified Stimulus Indebtedness programs that the Parent Borrower
and/or such Subsidiaries currently participate in or have applied to participate in, and have taken into consideration in making

notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have
been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The
Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and
other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any
such counsel, accountants or experts.

appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative
Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent reasonably satisfactory to the Parent Borrower
which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Parent Borrower to a successor Administrative
Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Parent Borrower and such
successor. After the Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue
in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub‑agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender (including each Issuing Bank) acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its
own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender (including each Issuing Bank) also acknowledges that
it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

ARTICLE IX
Guarantee
SECTION 9.01.      Guarantee (a) The Parent Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders and their respective successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns,
the prompt and complete payment and performance by the Subsidiary Borrowers when due (whether at the stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise) of the Subsidiary Obligations (other than, with respect to any Guarantor, any Excluded Swap
Obligations of such Guarantor). As used in this Article IX, the term “Lenders” includes affiliates of Lenders which are parties to
any Specified Cash Management Agreements or Specified Swap Agreements.
(b)      The Parent Borrower agrees that the Subsidiary Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed
the amount of the liability of the Parent Borrower hereunder that would exist in the absence of this Article IX without impairing
this Guarantee or affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder.
(c)      This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect until all the Subsidiary Obligations shall have been
satisfied by payment in full in immediately available funds, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and the Commitments shall
be terminated, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this Guarantee the Subsidiary Borrowers may be free
from any Subsidiary Obligations.
(d)      No payment made by any Borrower, any Guarantor, any other guarantor or any other Person or received or
collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from any Borrower, any Guarantor, any other guarantor or any other Person
by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in reduction
of or in payment of the Subsidiary Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of the
Parent Borrower hereunder which shall, notwithstanding any such payment (other than any payment made by the Parent
Borrower in respect of the Subsidiary Obligations or any payment received or collected from the Parent Borrower in respect of
the Subsidiary Obligations), remain liable for the Subsidiary Obligations until the Subsidiary Obligations are paid in full in
immediately available funds, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and the Commitments are terminated.
SECTION 9.02.      No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment made by the Parent Borrower hereunder or any
set-off or application of funds of the Parent Borrower by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Parent Borrower shall not
be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Subsidiary Borrowers or
any other Guarantor or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for
the payment of the Subsidiary Obligations nor shall the
94


================================================================================
[PAGE 273 OF 401]
================================================================================
Parent Borrower seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the Subsidiary Borrowers or any other
Guarantor in respect of payments made by the Parent Borrower under this Guarantee, until all amounts owing to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Subsidiary Borrowers on account of the Subsidiary Obligations are paid in full in
immediately available funds, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and the Commitments are terminated. If any amount shall
be paid to the Parent Borrower on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Subsidiary Obligations shall not
have been paid in full in immediately available funds, such amount shall be held by the Parent Borrower for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by the Parent Borrower, be turned over to the
Administrative Agent in the exact form received by the Parent Borrower (duly indorsed by the Parent Borrower to the
Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Subsidiary Obligations whether matured or unmatured, in such order
as the Administrative Agent may determine.
SECTION 9.03.      Amendments, etc. with respect to the Subsidiary Obligations. The Parent Borrower shall
remain obligated under this Guarantee notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against the Parent Borrower and
without notice to or further assent by the Parent Borrower, any demand for payment of any of the Subsidiary Obligations made
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and any of the
Subsidiary Obligations continued, and the Subsidiary Obligations or the liability of any other Person upon or for any part thereof,
or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part,
be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, and this Agreement and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith may be
amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, in accordance with Section 10.02, as the Administrative
Agent (or the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be) may deem advisable from time to time, and any collateral
security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the
Subsidiary Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released without affecting the Parent Borrower’s
obligations under this Article IX. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to protect, secure,
perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Subsidiary Obligations or for this Guarantee.
SECTION 9.04.      Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. The Parent Borrower waives any and all notice of the
creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Subsidiary Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee; the Subsidiary Obligations, and any of
them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in
reliance upon this Article IX; and all dealings between the Parent Borrower and any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to have been had or
consummated in reliance upon this Article IX. The Parent Borrower waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment
and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon the Subsidiary Borrowers or any of the Guarantors with respect to the Subsidiary
Obligations. The Parent Borrower understands and agrees that this Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and
unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any of the Subsidiary
Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect
95

thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim
(other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by any Subsidiary
Borrower or any other Person against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or
without notice to or knowledge of any Borrower or any Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an
equitable or legal discharge of the Subsidiary Borrowers for the Subsidiary Obligations, or of the Parent Borrower under this
Article IX, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When making any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and
remedies hereunder against the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation
to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Subsidiary Borrowers, any
other Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Subsidiary Obligations or any right of
offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such
other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from any Subsidiary Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or to
realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of any Subsidiary
Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve
the Parent Borrower of any obligation or liability under this Article IX, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies,
whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Parent Borrower
under this Article IX. For the purposes hereof “demand” shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal
proceedings.
SECTION 9.05.       Reinstatement. This Article IX shall continue to be effective, or shall be reinstated, as the case
may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Subsidiary Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be
restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or
reorganization of any Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or
conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, any Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or
otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.
SECTION 9.06.      Payments. The Parent Borrower hereby guarantees that payments hereunder will be paid to the
Administrative Agent without set-off or counterclaim in dollars or the applicable Alternative Currency at the office of the
Administrative Agent located at 10 South Dearborn Street, 7th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60603-2300 and to the following wire
instructions of the Administrative Agent (or such other address or wire instructions of the Administrative Agent that may be

SECTION 9.07.      Keepwell. Each Borrower Qualified Keepwell Provider hereby jointly and severally absolutely,
unconditionally, and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time for the
Parent Borrower to qualify as an Eligible Contract Participant during the Swap Guarantee Eligibility Period in respect of any
Swap Obligation (provided, however, that each Borrower Qualified Keepwell Provider shall only be liable under this Section
9.07 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section
9.07, or otherwise under this Guarantee, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer,
and not for any greater amount). The obligations of each Borrower Qualified Keepwell Provider under this Section 9.07 shall
remain in full force and effect until the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement have expired, been discharged or have
otherwise been terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each Borrower Qualified Keepwell Provider intends
that this Section 9.07 constitute, and this Section 9.07 shall be deemed to constitute, a “keepwell, support, or other agreement” for
the benefit of the Parent Borrower for all purposes of section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

The Administrative Agent or any Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it

be limited to particular notices or communications.
Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes (i) notices and other communications to a Lender (including an

intended recipient (such as by the “return receipt requested” function, as available, return e-mail or other written

(v)       Any Electronic System used by the Administrative Agent is provided “as is” and “as available.” The
Agent Parties (as defined below) do not warrant the adequacy of such Electronic Systems and expressly disclaim liability
for errors or omissions in the Communications. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including any
warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from
viruses or other code defects, is made by any Agent Party in connection with the Communications or any Electronic
System. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the “Agent Parties”) have
any liability to any Borrower or the other Loan Parties, any Lender, the Issuing Bank or
98


================================================================================
[PAGE 277 OF 401]
================================================================================
any other Person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, incidental or consequential
damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the any Loan Party’s or the
Administrative Agent’s transmission of communications through an Electronic System, in each case except as found by a
final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith

“Communications” means, collectively, any notice, demand, communication, information, document or other material
provided by or on behalf of any Loan Party pursuant to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated therein
which is distributed by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank by means of electronic

SECTION 10.02.      Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank
or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the Guarantee Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights
or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the Guarantee Agreement or
consent to any departure by any Borrower or any Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of
Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any
Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
(b) Neither this Agreement nor the Guarantee Agreement nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived,
amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers or the Guarantors,
as the case may be, and the Required Lenders or by the Borrowers or the Guarantors, as the case may be, and the Administrative
Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any
Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce
the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,
(iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or
any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of
expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.16(b) or (c) in
a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v)
release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, without the written
consent of each Lender (except that no approval of the Lenders shall be required to release a Guarantor in connection with the
disposition of all the capital stock of such Guarantor not prohibited by the Loan Documents) or (vi) change any of the provisions
of this Section or the definition of “Commitment”, the definition of “Required Lenders”, the definition of “Applicable

Percentage” or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify
any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender;
provided, further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent
or an Issuing Bank without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be. If the
Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower acting together identify any ambiguity, omission, mistake, typographical error or
other defect in any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, then the Administrative Agent and the Parent
Borrower shall be permitted to amend, modify or supplement such provision to cure such ambiguity, omission, mistake,
typographical error or other defect, and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any
other party to this Agreement.
SECTION 10.03.      Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Parent Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable
and documented out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and the Lead Arrangers,
including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one domestic counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Lead
Arrangers, collectively, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof and (ii) all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender,
including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one domestic counsel and one foreign counsel, as necessary, in each
applicable jurisdiction for the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with
the enforcement or preservation of its rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its
rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such
Loans or Letters of Credit.
(b) The Parent Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Co-Documentation
Agents, the Lead Arrangers, each Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each
such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee,
incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of
this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties
hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by an Issuing Bank to honor a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any
property owned or operated by the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way
to the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not such claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding is brought by the Borrower or
any other Loan Party or their respective equity holders, Affiliates, creditors or any

================================================================================
other third Person and whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party
thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or related expenses are found by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of, or material breach of its obligations under the Loan Documents by,
such Indemnitee or such Indemnitee’s employer or any Affiliate of either thereof or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, advisors or agents. Paragraph (b) of this Section shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that

thereunder, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is
sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related
expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank in its capacity as
such.

claim against any other party and any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive

Loan Document, or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit
or the use of the proceeds thereof; provided that, nothing in this clause (d) shall relieve the Borrowers of any obligation they may
have to indemnify an Indemnitee against special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages asserted against such Indemnitee by
a third party.
(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.
SECTION 10.04.      Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure

obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by a Borrower
without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender (including any Issuing Bank) may assign or otherwise transfer its
rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be

================================================================================
(E)    no assignment (including any assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund)
shall be permitted if, immediately after giving effect thereto, amounts would become payable by any Borrower under
Section 2.13 or 2.15 (including amounts payable under Section 2.15 in respect of withholding taxes) that are in excess of
those that would be payable under such Section in respect of the amount assigned if such assignment were not made;
(F)    no assignment shall be made to a natural person; and
(G)    no assignment shall be made to any Borrower or its Affiliates.
(H)    For the purposes of this Section 10.04(b), the term “Approved Fund” has the following meaning:
“Approved Fund” means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding
or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or
managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a
Lender.
(iii)     Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of
the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement
(including, in the case of any Non-U.S. Lender (including each Issuing Bank that is a Non-U.S. Lender), obligations under
Section 2.15(f)), and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering
all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall
continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 10.03); provided, however, that no such assignment or
transfer shall be deemed to be a waiver of any rights which any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall
have against such Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender (including an Issuing Bank) of rights or obligations under this
Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender
of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with, and subject to the conditions set forth in, paragraph (c) of this
Section.
(iv)     The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its
offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant
to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and
each Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower, any Issuing Bank and (solely with respect to the
Revolving Credit Exposure of such Lender) any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

(v)     Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an
assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the
processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by
paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information

the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Issuing
Bank, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A)
such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (C) the relevant Participant will have no proprietary interest in the
benefit of this Agreement or in any monies received by such Lender under or in relation to this Agreement, (D) the relevant
Participant will under no circumstances be subrogated to, or substituted in respect of, such Lender's claims under this Agreement
or have otherwise any contractual relationship with, or rights against, any Borrower under, or in relation to, this Agreement
(except as set forth in the following sentence with regards to benefits that each Participant is entitled to under Sections 2.13, 2.14
and 2.15 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired an interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
Section) and (E) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the applicable Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole
right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (v) and (vi) of the first proviso to Section 10.02(b)
that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant shall also be entitled to the
benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.16(c) as though it
were a Lender; provided that, the foregoing sentence shall not apply to Ralph Lauren Europe Sàrl. Each Lender that sells a
participation, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain a register on which it enters
the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans
or other obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to
disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information
relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan
Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or
other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the
Participant Register shall be conclusive, and such Lender, each Loan Party and the Administrative Agent shall treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Participant Register
104

================================================================================
pursuant to the terms hereof as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary.
(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15 unless such Participant shall
have complied with the requirements of such Section; provided, that in any case in which a Participant is so entitled, any such
Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender would
have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
Participant is made with the Parent Borrower's prior written consent, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater
payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. A Participant that
would be a Non-U.S. Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless the Parent Borrower is
notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the applicable Borrower, to
comply with Section 2.15(e) as though it were a Lender.
(d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no
such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall (i) release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any
such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto (ii) require any payments to be made by any Borrower or grant to any
person any more extensive rights than those required to be made or granted to the relevant Lender under the Loan Documents, or
(iii) upon any enforcement of such pledge or assignment of a security interest, result in any assignment, transfer or sub-
participation of any such rights under the Loan Documents which is in breach of this Clauses (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 10.04.
SECTION 10.05.      Survival. All representations and warranties made by the Borrowers herein and the other
Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, and
shall terminate at such time as no principal of or accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this
Agreement (other than contingent indemnification obligations that are not due and payable) is outstanding and unpaid, no Letter
of Credit is outstanding and the Commitments have expired or been terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15,
10.03, 10.13 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or

(and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken
together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement and any separate letter agreements with

written consent and pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided, further, without limiting the foregoing, (i) to the extent the
Administrative Agent has agreed to accept any Electronic Signature, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders shall be

any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without

a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its
Affiliates’ directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors, in each case who

Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any Governmental Authority (including any self-regulatory authority,
such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners) (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by
any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any

breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than a Borrower which is not subject to a confidentiality obligation known to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to such information. For the purposes of this Section, “Information” means all
information received from any Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to such Borrower, any Subsidiary or their respective
businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by such Borrower or any Subsidiary and other than information pertaining to this
Agreement routinely provided by arrangers to data service providers, including league table providers, that serve the lending

information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of
Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.
SECTION 10.13.      Satisfaction in Applicable Currency. (a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any
court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the
fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal
banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Business
Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.
(b) The obligation of each Borrower hereunder or in respect of the Letters of Credit to make payments in a
currency (the “Agreement Currency”) shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than
the Agreement Currency, be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent and the
109


================================================================================
[PAGE 288 OF 401]
================================================================================
Lenders may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with
the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the Agreement Currency, the applicable Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and each Lender (as an alternative
or additional cause of action) against such loss (if any) and if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased exceeds the
sum originally due to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the Agreement Currency, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders agree to remit such excess to the applicable Borrower. The obligations of each Borrower contained in this Section 10.13
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.

anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties,

extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution
Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:the application of any Write-Down and
Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by
any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and
(b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
(i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected
Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and
that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such
liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
(iii)the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers
of the applicable Resolution Authority.
SECTION 10.15.      No Fiduciary Duty. The Administrative Agent, each Lender and their Affiliates (collectively,
solely for purposes of this paragraph, the “Lenders”), may have economic interests that conflict with those of each of the
Borrowers, its stockholders and/or its affiliates.  Each Borrower agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be
deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Lender, on the one
hand, and any Borrower, its stockholders or its affiliates, on the other.  Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are
arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrowers, on the other, and (ii) in
connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed
110


================================================================================
[PAGE 289 OF 401]
================================================================================
an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Borrower, its stockholders or its affiliates with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of
whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise any Borrower, its stockholders or its Affiliates on other
matters) or any other obligation to any Borrower except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each
Lender is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of any Borrower, its management, stockholders, creditors or
any other Person.  Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent
it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and
the process leading thereto.  Each Borrower agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services of any
nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such Borrower, in connection with such transaction or the process leading
thereto.
SECTION 10.16.      USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby notifies the
Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107‑56 (signed into law October
26, 2001)) (the “Patriot Act”), such Lender and Agent is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the
Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of the Borrowers and other information that will allow such Lender
or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. The Borrowers shall
provide such information and take such actions as are reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in order
to assist the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in maintaining compliance with the Patriot Act.
SECTION 10.17.      Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that the Loan Documents
provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Swap Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC
(such support “QFC Credit Support” and each such QFC a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with
respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the
“U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below
applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of
the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):
In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a
proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC
Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any
rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective
to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and
such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the
United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party
becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that
might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered
Party are
111


================================================================================
[PAGE 290 OF 401]
================================================================================
permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special
Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a
state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the
parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a
Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
SECTION 10.18.      Existing Credit Agreement. (a) The Lenders which are parties to the Existing Credit
Agreement (which Lenders constitute the “Required Lenders” as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) hereby (i) waive the
requirement, set forth in Section 2.07(c) of the Existing Credit Agreement, that the Parent Borrower give not less than two
Business Days’ notice of any termination of the Commitments (as defined therein), (ii) acknowledge and agree that, for purposes
of determining the total “Revolving Credit Exposures” (as defined therein) that would be outstanding thereunder on the date of
such termination, the letters of credit issued thereunder that are listed on Schedule 2.04 hereof shall (as a result of the operation of
the antepenultimate sentence of Section 2.04(a) of this Agreement, which provides that on the Effective Date such letters of credit
shall be deemed to be “Letters of Credit” issued hereunder) on the Effective Date be deemed no longer outstanding under the
Existing Credit Agreement and (iii) pursuant to Section 9.02 of the Existing Credit Agreement, consent to the execution and
delivery by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its capacity as Administrative Agent (under and as defined in the Existing Credit
Agreement) for and on behalf of the Lenders (under and as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), of this Agreement to
evidence or effectuate (as set forth in Section 10.02(b)) the waivers and agreements set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above.
(b) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its capacity as Administrative Agent as defined in the Existing Credit
Agreement hereby (i) waives, for and on behalf of the Lenders (as defined therein), the requirement, set forth in Section 2.07(c)
of the Existing Credit Agreement, that the Parent Borrower give not less than two Business Days’ notice of any termination of the
Commitments (as defined therein) and (ii) acknowledges and agrees, for and on behalf of the Lenders (as defined therein), that
for purposes of determining the total “Revolving Credit Exposures” (as defined therein) that would be outstanding thereunder on
the date of such termination, the letters of credit issued thereunder that are listed on Schedule 2.04 hereof shall on the Effective
Date be deemed no longer outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement.
(c)    Upon the Effective Date, the Existing Credit Agreement shall deemed to be terminated.

hereto, BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., as Syndication Agent, ING BANK N.V., DUBLIN BRANCH, DEUTSCHE BANK
SECURITIES INC., SUMITOMO MITSUI BANKING CORPORATION and HSBC BANK USA, N.A., as Co-Documentation
Agents, and JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., as Administrative Agent.
The parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
Definitions
SECTION 1.01.      Defined Terms.
As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings specified below:
“2020 Senior Notes” means the senior unsecured notes of the Parent Borrower due August 18, 2020, which bear
interest at a fixed rate of 2.625%.
“ABR”, when used in reference to any Loan or Borrowing, refers to whether such Loan, or the Loans comprising
such Borrowing, are bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate. Only Loans denominated in
dollars may be ABR Loans.
“Additional Specified Stimulus Indebtedness” means senior unsecured or subordinated Indebtedness incurred
pursuant to a credit or financial support program of or backed by a Governmental Authority with the intent to mitigate through
liquidity or other financial relief the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on the business and operations of the Parent Borrower
and its Subsidiaries; provided that (i) the aggregate principal amount of all such Additional Specified Stimulus Indebtedness shall
not exceed $100,000,000, (ii) such Additional Specified Stimulus Indebtedness shall not be subject to any Guarantee by any
Person other than a Loan Party, (iii) both immediately before and immediately after the incurrence of such Additional Specified
Stimulus Indebtedness, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date such Additional Specified Stimulus
Indebtedness is incurred, (iv) the covenants and events of default applicable to such Additional Specified Stimulus Indebtedness
(taken as a whole) shall be reflective of market terms and conditions for the type of Indebtedness incurred or issued pursuant to
the applicable credit or financial support program at the time of issuance or incurrence thereof (as determined by the Parent
Borrower in good faith) and (v) such Indebtedness shall be incurred during the Specified Period (as defined in the Five-Year
Credit Agreement).
“Adjusted Debt” means, for any date, for the Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries, all Indebtedness plus all
Operating Lease Obligations (in each case, computed on a consolidated basis) outstanding on such date.
“Adjusted LIBO Rate” means, with respect to any Eurocurrency Borrowing for any Interest Period, an interest rate
per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/100
4


================================================================================
[PAGE 300 OF 401]
================================================================================
of 1%) equal to (a) the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period multiplied by (b) the Statutory Reserve Rate.
“Administrative Agent” means JPMorgan in its capacity as administrative agent for the Lenders hereunder,
together with any non-U.S. Affiliate of JPMorgan, to the extent that JPMorgan determines that it is necessary or appropriate to
use such non-U.S. Affiliate in acting as administrative agent hereunder. Any obligations owed by any Borrower to the
Administrative Agent hereunder shall be owed solely to JPMorgan, and not to any Affiliate of JPMorgan, unless such Borrower
otherwise agrees in writing.
“Administrative Questionnaire” means an Administrative Questionnaire in a form supplied by the Administrative
Agent.
“Affected Financial Institution” means (a) any EEA Financial Institution or (b) any UK Financial Institution.
“Affiliate” means, with respect to a specified Person, another Person that directly, or indirectly through one or
more intermediaries, Controls or is Controlled by or is under common Control with the Person specified.
“Agent Party” has the meaning assigned to such term in Section 10.01(d).
“Agreement Currency” has the meaning assigned to such term in Section 10.13(b).
“Alternate Base Rate” means, for any day, a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on
such day, (b) the NYFRB Rate in effect on such day plus ½ of 1% and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one month Interest
Period on such day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day) plus 1%; provided that for the
purpose of this definition, the Adjusted LIBO Rate for any day shall be based on the LIBO Screen Rate (or if the LIBO Screen
Rate is not available for such one month Interest Period, the Interpolated Rate) at approximately 11:00 a.m. London time on such
day. Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate, the NYFRB Rate or the Adjusted LIBO Rate shall
be effective from and including the effective date of such change in the Prime Rate, the NYFRB Rate or the Adjusted LIBO Rate,
respectively. If the Alternate Base Rate is being used as an alternate rate of interest pursuant to Section 2.12, then the Alternate
Base Rate shall be the greater of clauses (a) and (b) above and shall be determined without reference to clause (c) above. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Alternate Base Rate as determined pursuant to the foregoing would be less than 1.75%, such rate shall
be deemed to be 1.75% for purposes of this Agreement.
“Alternative Currency” means (a) Euros, Hong Kong Dollars and Yen and (b) any other currency (other than
dollars) that is freely available, freely transferable and freely convertible into dollars and in which dealings in deposits are carried
on in the London interbank market, provided that such currency is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders.

Borrower or any of its Affiliates from time to time concerning or relating to bribery or corruption.
“Applicable Percentage” means, with respect to any Lender, the percentage of the total Commitments represented

the total Commitment (disregarding any Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) represented by each Lender’s Commitment. If the
Commitments have terminated or expired, “Applicable Percentage” shall mean, with respect to any Lender, the percentage of the
aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Exposure represented by the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such
Lender’s Revolving Credit Exposure.
“Applicable Rate” means, for any day, with respect to any Eurocurrency Loan, any ABR Loan or with respect to
the commitment fees payable hereunder, as the case may be, the applicable rate per annum set forth below (expressed in basis
points) under the caption “Eurocurrency Spread”, “ABR Spread” or “Commitment Fee Rate”, as the case may be, based upon the
ratings by Moody’s and S&P, respectively, applicable on such date to the Index Debt:
Level
Index Debt Ratings
Eurocurrency
Spread
ABR Spread
Commitment
Fee Rate
Level I
≥ AA- by S&P or Aa3 by Moody’s
162.50
62.50

100.00
27.50
Level V
< A- by S&P or A3 by Moody’s
212.50
112.50
28.50
For purposes of the foregoing, (i) if both Moody’s and S&P shall not have in effect a rating for the Index Debt
(other than by reason of the circumstances referred to in the next-to-last sentence of this definition), then such rating agency shall
be deemed to have established a rating for the Index Debt in Level V; (ii) if the ratings established or deemed to have been
established by Moody’s and S&P for the Index Debt shall fall within different Levels, the Applicable Rate shall be based on the
higher of the two ratings unless one of the two ratings is two or more Levels lower than the other, in which case the Applicable
Rate shall be determined by reference to the Level next below that of the higher of the two ratings; and (iii) if the ratings
established or deemed to have been established by Moody’s and S&P for the Index Debt shall be changed (other than as a result

its option may make any Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such
Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay such Loan in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and provided, further, that no such option may be exercised by any Lender if,
immediately after giving effect thereto, amounts would become payable by a Loan Party under Section 2.13 or 2.15 that are in
excess of those that would be payable under such Section if such option were not exercised.
(c)      At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in
an aggregate amount that is (i) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in dollars, an integral multiple of $500,000
and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) in the case of an Alternative Currency Borrowing, the Dollar Equivalent of an integral
multiple of $500,000 and not less than the Dollar Equivalent of $5,000,000. At the time that each ABR Borrowing is made, such
Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $500,000; provided that an
ABR Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Commitments. Borrowings
of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of 15
Eurocurrency Borrowings outstanding.
(d)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Borrower shall be entitled to request, or to elect
to convert or continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date.
(e)      Each Lender may, at its option, make any Loan available to any Subsidiary Borrower by causing any foreign
or domestic branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not increase
the costs to such Subsidiary Borrower with respect to such Loan or affect the obligation of such Subsidiary Borrower to repay
such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 2.03.      Requests for Borrowings. To request a Loan, the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on
behalf of any other Borrower) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by hand delivery, telecopy or (pursuant to
procedures approved by the Administrative Agent) electronic transmission to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing
Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Parent Borrower (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency
Borrowing denominated in dollars, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the
proposed Borrowing, (b) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency, not later than 11:00
a.m., New York City time, four Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing, or (c)  in the case of an ABR
Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such Borrowing Request
shall be irrevocable and shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i)       the Borrower of the requested Borrowing;
(ii)       the aggregate amount of such Borrowing;
(iii)       the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;
(iv)       whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing;
(v)       in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be
a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”;
(vi)       in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the currency in which such Borrowing is to be denominated;
and
(vii)       the location and number of the applicable Borrower’s account to which funds are to be disbursed, which
shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.05.
If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing (i) if such Borrowing is to be denominated
in dollars, shall be an ABR Borrowing and (ii) if such Borrowing is to be denominated in an Alternative Currency, shall be a
Eurocurrency Borrowing. If no election as to the currency of the requested Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing
shall be denominated in dollars. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency Borrowing, then the
Parent Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration. Promptly following receipt of a
Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and
of the amount of such Lender’s Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.
SECTION 2.04.      [Reserved].
SECTION 2.05.      Funding of Borrowings. (a)  Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on
the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon., New York City time, to the account of
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that if an ABR
Borrowing is requested for disbursement on the same day after 11:00 a.m., New York time, then
39


================================================================================
[PAGE 335 OF 401]
================================================================================
each Lender shall make the Loan to be made by it hereunder in such manner by 3:00 p.m., New York City time. The
Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received,
in like funds, to an account of the applicable Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent and designated by the Parent
Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request.
(a)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed time of any
Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available at such time in accordance with paragraph (a)
of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In
such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the
date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative
Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. If such Lender pays such amount to the
Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. If such Lender’s share
of such Borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after the date
such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Parent Borrower
and any other applicable Borrower of such failure and shall also be entitled to recover such amount from the applicable Borrower,
on demand, with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans hereunder accruing from the date of such
Borrowing. If the Parent Borrower or the applicable Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount,
the Parent Borrower and such applicable Borrower shall have no further obligations to such Lender with respect to such amount.
SECTION 2.06.      Interest Elections. (a)  Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) may elect to convert
such Borrowing (i) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in dollars, to an ABR Borrowing; or (ii) in the case of
an ABR Borrowing, to a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in dollars or to continue such Borrowing in the same currency
and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Parent
Borrower (on behalf of itself or any other Borrower) may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected
Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such
Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
(b)      To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of another
Borrower) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by hand delivery, telecopy or electronic transmission (pursuant
to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent) to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form
approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Parent Borrower by the time that a
40


================================================================================
[PAGE 336 OF 401]
================================================================================
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Parent Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type
resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such Interest Election Request shall be
irrevocable.
(c)      Each Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i)       the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected
with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case
the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii)       the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a
Business Day;
(iii)       whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
(iv)       if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after
giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Parent
Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of another Borrower) shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one
month’s duration.
(d)      Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each
Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e)      If the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of another Borrower) fails to deliver a timely Interest
Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless
such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing (i) if denominated in dollars, shall
be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) if denominated in an Alternative Currency, shall be converted to a one month Interest
Period denominated in the same currency as the Eurocurrency Borrowing being continued. Notwithstanding any contrary
provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the
Required Lenders, so notifies the Parent Borrower, then, so long as such Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding
Borrowing denominated in dollars may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each
Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto.
(f)      By entering into this Agreement, the parties hereto have assumed in good faith that the interest payable at
the rates specified in this Agreement is not and will not be subject to any Tax deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax.
Nevertheless, if a Tax deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax is required by Swiss law to be made by a Swiss Borrower
in
41


================================================================================
[PAGE 337 OF 401]
================================================================================
respect of any interest payable by it under a Loan Document and should it be unlawful for a Swiss Borrower to comply with
Section 2.15 for any reason, and if the gross-up in accordance with Section 2.15 is effectively not paid: (i) the applicable interest
rate in relation to that interest payment shall be (A) the interest rate which would have applied to that interest payment in the
absence of this Section 2.06(f)), divided by (B) one minus the rate at which the relevant deduction on account of Swiss
Withholding Tax is required to be made (where the rate at which the relevant deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax is
required to be made is for this purpose expressed as a fraction of one rather than as a percentage); (ii) (A) a Swiss Borrower shall
be obliged to pay the relevant interest at the adjusted rate as set forth in this Section 2.06(f), and (B) a Swiss Borrower shall make
the deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax (within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law) on the
interest so recalculated; and (iii) all references to a rate of interest under a Loan Document applicable to a Swiss Borrower shall
be construed accordingly. To the extent that interest payable by a Swiss Borrower under this Agreement becomes subject to a
deduction of Swiss Withholding Tax, each relevant Lender and the Swiss Borrower shall promptly cooperate in completing any
procedural formalities (including submitting forms and documents required by the appropriate Tax authority) to the extent
possible and necessary for the Swiss Borrower to obtain authorization to make interest payments without them being subject to
such deduction of Swiss Withholding Tax or to reduce the applicable withholding tax rate. If a Swiss Borrower pays the interest
recalculated under this Section 2.06(f), the Swiss Borrower shall cooperate with each relevant Lender to enable that Lender to
receive a full or partial refund of the Swiss Withholding Tax under an applicable double taxation treaty. In the event Swiss
Withholding Tax is refunded to a Lender by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, the relevant Lender shall immediately forward
such amount to the Swiss Borrower. This Section 2.06(f) shall not apply and no interest shall be recalculated pursuant to this
Section 2.06(f) if a deduction of Swiss Withholding Tax is due as a result of any non-compliance by a Lender with the provisions
of Section 10.04 or the Lender (i) making a misrepresentation as to its status according to Section 1.07 as a Swiss Qualifying
Bank or as (only) one Swiss Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank or (ii) ceasing to be a Swiss Qualifying Bank or as (only) one Swiss
Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank after the time it acceded to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for
the avoidance of doubt, (i) a Lender who is not treated as not being a Swiss Qualifying Bank shall not be under any obligation to
change its status into a Swiss Qualifying Bank, (ii) the documentation which a Lender executes on becoming a party hereto shall
not be invalidated by any failure of a Lender to comply with this Section 2.06(f), Section 10.04 or Section 1.07 and (iii) none of
the Loan Documents shall be invalidated by any failure of a Lender to comply with this Section 2.06(f), Section 10.04(b)(i)(A) or
Section 1.07 or indicates its status as a Swiss Qualifying Bank or Swiss Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank as unknown.
SECTION 2.07.      Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a)  Unless previously terminated in accordance
with this Agreement, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
(b)      The Parent Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; provided
that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than
$1,000,000, or, if less than $1,000,000, the remaining amount of the total Commitments, and (ii) the Parent Borrower shall not
terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of
42


================================================================================
[PAGE 338 OF 401]
================================================================================
the Loans in accordance with Section 2.09, the total Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.
(c)      The Parent Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the
Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least two Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or
reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative
Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Parent Borrower pursuant to this Section
shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Parent Borrower may state that
such notice is conditioned upon another event, such as the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may
be revoked by the Parent Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the
Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
SECTION 2.08.      Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a)  Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises
to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan made to such
Borrower on the Maturity Date.
(b)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender to such Borrower, including the
amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(c)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain a Register pursuant to Section 10.04(b)(iv) and an account for each
Lender in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type and currency thereof and the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the
account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.
(d)      The entries made in the accounts and Register maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section
shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of
any Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(e)      Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the
applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or,
if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent.
Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment
pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named
therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
43


================================================================================
[PAGE 339 OF 401]
================================================================================
SECTION 2.09.      Prepayment of Loans. (a)  Each Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to
time to prepay voluntarily any Borrowing made to such Borrower in whole or in part without premium or penalty, subject to prior
notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.
(b)      The Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) shall notify the Administrative
Agent in writing (by hand delivery, telecopy or (pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent) electronic
transmission) of any voluntary prepayment hereunder prior to (i) in the case of ABR Loans, 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on
such date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in dollars, 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the
Business Day immediately preceding such date of prepayment, (iii) in the case of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Euros,
12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business Days prior to such date of prepayment and (iv) in the case of Eurocurrency
Loans denominated in any Alternative Currencies other than Euros, 12:00 noon, New York City time, four Business Days prior to
such date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of
each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and whether the prepayment is of Eurocurrency Loans, ABR Loans or a
combination thereof, and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each; provided that, if a notice of voluntary
prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.07,
then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.07.
Promptly following receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each
partial voluntary prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $500,000 or a multiple of $100,000
in excess thereof (or the Dollar Equivalent thereof). Each voluntary prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the
Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.
(c)      If on any Exchange Rate Date the Administrative Agent determines that the total Revolving Credit Exposure
exceeds 105% of the total Commitments, the Borrowers shall within three Business Days after such date, prepay Loans in an
aggregate amount such that, after deducting therefrom the amount so prepaid, the total Revolving Credit Exposure does not
exceed the total Commitments.
(d)      If, as of the last Business Day of any calendar week, commencing with the first complete calendar week
after the Effective Date, the Consolidated Cash Balance exceeds $1,000,000,000 as of the end of such applicable Business Day
(such excess, the “Excess Cash Amount”), then the Borrowers shall, on the next Business Day thereafter, prepay the Loans in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (x) the Excess Cash Amount and (y) the aggregate principal amount of Loans
then outstanding.
(e)      Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.11 and any
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14.
44


================================================================================
[PAGE 340 OF 401]
================================================================================
SECTION 2.10.      Fees. (a)  The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
each Lender a commitment fee for the period from and including the Effective Date to the last day of the Availability Period,
computed at the Applicable Rate on the average daily amount of the Available Commitment of such Lender during the period for
which payment is made. Commitment fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December
of each year shall be payable on the fifth Business Day following such last day, commencing on October 7, 2020; provided that
all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on
which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
(b)      [Reserved].
(c)      The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the
amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
(d)      All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the
Administrative Agent for distribution, in the case of commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Except as may be
expressly agreed in writing between the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent with respect to fees to the Administrative
Agent, fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances (other than in the case, and to the extent, of any overpayment
thereof by the applicable Borrower).
SECTION 2.11.      Interest; Eurocurrency Tranches. (a)  The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear
interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
(b)      The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the
Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
(c)      The interest rate for Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies shall be subject to customary adjustments
if and to the extent loans denominated in such Alternative Currencies are not customarily priced on a LIBO Rate basis; provided,
however that such adjustments shall not apply to Loans denominated in Euros, Yen or Hong Kong Dollars.
(d)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount
payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue
principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section
or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
45


================================================================================
[PAGE 341 OF 401]
================================================================================
(e)      Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and
upon termination of all of the Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be
payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan
prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date
of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the
current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
(f)      All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by
reference to (i) the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate or (ii) the LIBO Rate or
Interpolated Rate at times when the LIBO Rate or Interpolated Rate is based on the HKD Screen Rate shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall
be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.12.      Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a
Eurocurrency Borrowing:
(a)      the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error) that by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate (including because the LIBO Screen Rate is not available or
published on a current basis), as applicable, for such Interest Period; or
(b)      the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO
Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of
making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of
any other Borrower) and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative
Agent notifies the Parent Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any
Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency
Borrowing shall be ineffective, (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in dollars, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing; provided that (A) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one
Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted and (B) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice
affect only one currency, then Borrowings in other permitted currencies shall be permitted. The Administrative Agent agrees to
give prompt notice to the Parent Borrower when the circumstances that gave rise to a notice under this Section 2.12 no longer
exist. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i)
the circumstances set forth in clause (a) have arisen and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or (ii) the circumstances
set forth in clause
46


================================================================================
[PAGE 342 OF 401]
================================================================================
(a) have not arisen but either (w) the supervisor for the administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate has made a public statement that
the administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate is insolvent (and there is no successor administrator that will continue publication of
the LIBO Screen Rate), (x) the administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate has made a public statement identifying a specific date
after which the LIBO Screen Rate will permanently or indefinitely cease to be published by it (and there is no successor
administrator that will continue publication of the LIBO Screen Rate), (y) the supervisor for the administrator of the LIBO Screen
Rate has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the LIBO Screen Rate will permanently or indefinitely
cease to be published or (z) the supervisor for the administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having
jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the LIBO Screen
Rate may no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall enter
into an amendment to establish an alternate rate of interest to the LIBO Rate that gives due consideration to the then prevailing
market convention for determining a rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States at such time and such other related
changes to this Agreement as may be applicable (but for the avoidance of doubt, such related changes shall not include a
reduction of the Applicable Rate); provided that, if such alternate rate of interest as so determined would be less than 0.75%, such
rate shall be deemed to be 0.75% for the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.02,
such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the
Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of the date notice of such alternate rate of interest is
provided to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that such Required Lenders object to such
amendment. Until an alternate rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with this paragraph (but, in the case of the
circumstances described in clauses (w), (x) or (y) above, only to the extent the LIBO Screen Rate for the applicable currency and
such Interest Period is not available or published at such time on a current basis), (i) any Interest Election Request that requests
the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, (ii) if
any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR
Borrowing. The LIBO Rate is derived from the London interbank offered rate. The London interbank offered rate is intended to
represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market.
In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel
contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE
Benchmark Administrator, the “IBA”) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is
possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an
appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans. In light of this eventuality, public
and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of
the London interbank offered rate. In the event that the London interbank offered rate is no longer available or in certain other
circumstances, this Section provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. However, the Administrative
Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration,
submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of “LIBO Rate” or
with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof.

SECTION 2.13.      Increased Costs. (a)  If any Change in Law shall:
(i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of,
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in
the Adjusted LIBO Rate);
(ii)       [reserved]; or
(iii)       shall subject the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes
indemnified under Section 2.15, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (f) of the definition of Excluded Taxes or (C)
Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its
deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender (or in the case of (iii) to such Administrative
Agent or Lender) of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make such Loan) or to
increase the cost to the Administrative Agent or such Lender or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the
Administrative Agent or such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Parent Borrower will pay to
the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, upon demand of such Person, such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered.
(b)      If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has
or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital (or on the capital of any corporation controlling
such Lender) as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or
such controlling corporation could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such
controlling corporation’s policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time the Parent Borrower will
pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such controlling corporation for any
such reduction suffered.
(c)      A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender as
specified in paragraph (a), (b) or (e) of this Section, containing (i) a reasonably detailed explanation of the basis on which such
amount or amounts were calculated and the Change in Law by reason of which it has become entitled to be so compensated and
(ii) confirmation of the matters set forth in the last sentence of Section 2.13(d), shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower and
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. No Lender shall be entitled to the benefits of this Section 2.13 unless such Lender shall
have complied with the requirements of this Section 2.13. The Parent Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due
on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d)      Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Parent Borrower shall not be required
to compensate a Lender pursuant to this
48


================================================================================
[PAGE 344 OF 401]
================================================================================
Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Parent
Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim
compensation therefor; provided, further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is
retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.13, no Lender shall demand compensation for any increased costs or
reduction referred to above in this Section if it shall not then be the general policy of such Lender to demand such compensation
in similar circumstances from comparable borrowers under comparable provisions of other credit agreements, if any (it being
understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that a waiver by any Lender in any given case of its right to demand such compensation
from any given borrower shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to constitute a change in the general policy of such Lender).
(e)      If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan to a Subsidiary Borrower that is a Foreign
Subsidiary is increased (or the amount of any sum received or receivable by any Lender or its lending office is reduced) by an
amount deemed by such Lender to be material, by reason of the fact that such Subsidiary Borrower is a Foreign Subsidiary, such
Subsidiary Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for such increased cost or reduction within 15 days after demand by such
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), which such Lender shall make within 90 days from the day such Lender has
notice of such increased cost or reduction.
SECTION 2.14.      Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency
Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the
conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan into an ABR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c)
the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant
hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.09(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or
(d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a
request by the Parent Borrower pursuant to Section 2.17, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate each
Lender for the loss and reasonable cost and expense attributable to such event (excluding loss of margin). In the case of a
Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount reasonably determined by
such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan
had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the
date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or
continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would
accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the
commencement of such period, for deposits in the applicable currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in
the applicable eurocurrency market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled
to receive pursuant to this Section, containing a reasonably detailed calculation of such amounts, shall be delivered to the Parent
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due
on any such certificate
49


================================================================================
[PAGE 345 OF 401]
================================================================================
within 10 days after receipt thereof. No Lender shall be entitled to the benefits of this Section 2.14 unless such Lender shall have
complied with the requirements of this Section 2.14.
SECTION 2.15.      Taxes. (a)   Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under
any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If
any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or
withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to
make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan
Party shall be increased as necessary so that, after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and
withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15), the amounts received with respect to this agreement
equal the sum which would have been received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
(b)      The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.
(c)      Each Loan Party shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, as promptly as possible but in
any event within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation
of such Loan Party under any Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and including any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability, together with, to the
extent available, a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other evidence
of such payment reasonably satisfactory to such Loan Party, delivered to such Loan Party as soon as practicable after any such
payment by a Lender or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.
(d)      As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a
Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence
of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e)      A payment to a Lender shall not be increased under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.15 and no
indemnification is due under paragraph (c) of this Section 2.15 if on the date on which the payment falls due the payment could
have been made without any deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax (i) had the Lender correctly declared its status as to
whether it is a Swiss Qualifying Bank, (ii) had the Lender complied with the assignment, transfer or exposure transfer restrictions
pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) had the Lender not ceased to be a
50


================================================================================
[PAGE 346 OF 401]
================================================================================
Swiss Qualifying Bank, or (iv) had the Swiss Non-Bank Rules not been breached as a result of an assignment or transfer of rights
and obligations under this Agreement after the occurrence of an Event of Default.
(f)      (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax, with respect to
payments made under this Agreement or any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and
executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such
Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set
forth in Section 2.15(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such
completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would
materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(i)       Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person,
(A)      any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or
prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon
the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that
such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(B)      any Lender that is not a U.S. Person shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the
date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable
request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(i)     in the case of Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a
party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of the applicable IRS Form W-8
establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty
and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, the applicable IRS Form W-8 establishing an
exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such
tax treaty;
(ii)     executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
51


================================================================================
[PAGE 347 OF 401]
================================================================================
(iii)     in the case of Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section
881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Lender is not a “bank” within
the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section
881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of the applicable IRS Form W-8; or to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not
the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, the applicable IRS Form W-
8, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other
certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if such Lender is a partnership and one or more
direct or indirect partners of such Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Lender may provide a U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C)      any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which
such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for
claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such
supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent
to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D)      If a payment made to a Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document would be subject to
U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting
requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable, or those
under an intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of Sections 1471 through 1474
of the Code), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by
law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation
prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional
documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has
complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such
payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.15(f)(ii)(D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA
after the date of this Credit Agreement.
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any
respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its
legal inability to do so.
52


================================================================================
[PAGE 348 OF 401]
================================================================================
(g)      Each Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full
amount of any Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority, together with any reasonable costs and expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, that are attributable (i) to such Lender and that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent and (ii) to
a Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.
(h)      If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines that it has received a refund which, in the good faith
judgment of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is allocable to any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant
to this Section 2.15, it shall promptly pay over such refund to such Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments
made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 2.15 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and
without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that
such Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan
Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority attributable to such amount
(including the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses described above of the Administrative Agent or such Lender)) to the
Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to
such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make
available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other
Person.
(i)      For purposes of this Section, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.
SECTION 2.16.      Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.  (a)  Each Borrower shall make
each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.13,
2.14 or 2.15, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds,
without set‑off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative
Agent be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All
such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, 7th Floor, Chicago, Illinois
60603-2300 and to the wire instructions of the Administrative Agent set forth in Section 9.06 (or such other address or wire
instructions of the Administrative Agent that may be provided from time to time by the Administrative Agent), except that
payments pursuant to Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The
Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate
recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date
for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest
thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars except payments
53


================================================================================
[PAGE 349 OF 401]
================================================================================
of principal of and interest on any Alternative Currency Loan shall be paid in the applicable currency.
(b)      If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all
amounts of principal, interest, fees, expenses and other amounts then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards
payment of interest, fees, expenses and other amounts then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of interest, fees, expenses and other amounts then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards
payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal
then due to such parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amounts received from any Guarantor shall be applied to Excluded
Swap Obligations of such Guarantor.
(c)      If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set‑off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in
respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of
the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent
necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount
of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or
any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored
to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained
by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant,
other than to the applicable Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall
apply), or any payment obtained pursuant to a court order. Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it
may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may
exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such
payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in
fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the
amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to
it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by
the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
54


================================================================================
[PAGE 350 OF 401]
================================================================================
(e)      If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(b) or
2.16(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts
thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such
Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
(f)      In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Subsidiary Borrower hereby
appoints the Parent Borrower to act as agent on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower for the purpose of (i) giving any notices or
requests contemplated to be given by such Subsidiary Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation,
Borrowing Requests, prepayment notices and Interest Election Requests and (ii) paying on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower
any Subsidiary Obligations owing by such Subsidiary Borrower; provided, that each Subsidiary Borrower shall retain the right, in
its discretion, to give directly any or all of such notices or requests or to make directly any or all of such payments.
(g)      The obligations of each Borrower under this Agreement are several although the Subsidiary Obligations are
guaranteed by the Parent Borrower under Article IX.
SECTION 2.17.      Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a)  If any Lender requests compensation
under Section 2.13, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority
for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different
lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its
offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any
material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.
(b)      If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, (ii) any Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, (iii) any
Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (iv) any Lender does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, modification,
consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires the consent of each of the
Lenders or each of the Lenders affected thereby (so long as the consent of the Required Lenders (with the percentage in such
definition being deemed to be 66 2/3% for this purpose) has been obtained), then the Parent Borrower may, at its sole expense (in
the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of this Section 2.17(b) only), upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent,
require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 10.04, provided that the Parent Borrower shall be required to pay the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section
10.04(b)(ii)(C), or pursuant to deemed assignment provisions established by the Administrative Agent to which the Parent
Borrower has previously consented in writing), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that
shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the
Parent Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably
be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to
55


================================================================================
[PAGE 351 OF 401]
================================================================================
the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from
the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other
amounts), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments
required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and
(iv) in the case of an assignment pursuant to clause (iv) above, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing. A Lender shall
not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise,
the circumstances entitling the Parent Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. No such assignment
shall be deemed to be a waiver of any rights which any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have
against the replaced Lender.
SECTION 2.18.      [Reserved].
SECTION 2.19.      Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting
Lender:
(a)      fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Available Commitment of such Defaulting Lender
pursuant to Section 2.10(a); and
(b)      the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in
determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any
amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.02); provided, that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a
Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of each Lender or each
Lender affected thereby.
ARTICLE III
Representations and Warranties
The Parent Borrower represents and warrants and each Subsidiary Borrower represents and warrants (to the extent
specifically applicable to such Subsidiary Borrower) to the Lenders that:
SECTION 3.01.      Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrowers, the Guarantors and the Parent Borrower’s
Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Regulation S-X, part 210.1-02 of Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations) is duly
organized, validly existing and, other than the Swiss Loan Party, in good standing (or, if applicable in a foreign jurisdiction,
enjoys the equivalent status under the laws of any jurisdiction of organization outside the United States of America) under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and,
except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.

[PAGE 352 OF 401]
================================================================================
SECTION 3.02.      Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions are within each Loan Party’s corporate powers
and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required, stockholder action. Each Loan Document has been
duly executed and delivered by each Loan Party which is a party thereto and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
such Loan Party, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
liquidation, reconstruction, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles of

result in a Material Adverse Effect (except for actions, suits or proceedings disclosed prior to December 30, 2019 in reports
publicly filed by the Parent Borrower under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which disclosure was true and
correct in all material respects as of the date made and as of the Effective Date) or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the

Environmental Laws or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any
Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect to

(b)   The Parent Borrower has implemented and maintains in effect policies and procedures designed to ensure
compliance by the Parent Borrower, its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents with Anti-
Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions, and the Parent Borrower, its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Parent
Borrower, their respective officers, employees, directors and agents, are in compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable
Sanctions in all material respects and are not knowingly engaged in any activity that would reasonably be expected to result in

of the Parent Borrower, any of their respective directors, officers or employees, or (b) to the knowledge of the Parent Borrower,
any agent of the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary that will act in any capacity in connection with or benefit from the credit

Subsidiary, as applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves to the extent required by GAAP or (b) to the extent that the
failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
SECTION 3.10.      ERISA. (i) Except as could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect,
each Plan is in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the provisions of the Code relating to Plans and the

law and regulations thereunder, and (ii) no ERISA Event or Foreign Plan Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur
that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events and Foreign Plan Events for which liability has been imposed or is
reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all
accumulated benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Accounting Standards

such amounts, exceed by more than $10,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the present value of all

by other information so furnished prior to the date on which this representation and warranty is made or deemed made) do not
contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information,
the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiary Borrowers represent only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time. As of the Effective Date, to the best knowledge of the Parent Borrower, the
information included in the Beneficial Ownership Certification provided by a Borrower on or prior to the Effective Date to any
Lender in connection with this Agreement is true and correct in all respects.

would otherwise result in a breach and/or violation of, (i) any provision of the Blocking Regulation (or any law or regulation
implementing the Blocking Regulation in any member state of the European Union) or (ii) any similar blocking or anti-boycott
law in the United Kingdom.

Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent
by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a
Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its
Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with any Borrower or any
Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties,
regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby

expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to
disclose, any information relating to the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the

action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of
the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default
unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Parent Borrower or a Lender, and the
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document
delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other
terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other
agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than
to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any
notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have
been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The
Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and
other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any
such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any
one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform
any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of
the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for
herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days’ notice to the Lenders and the Parent
Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Parent Borrower, to
appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative
Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent reasonably satisfactory to the Parent Borrower
which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Parent Borrower to a successor Administrative
Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Parent Borrower and such
successor. After the Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue
in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub‑agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related
agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
The Syndication Agent and Co-Documentation Agents shall not have any duties or responsibilities under the Loan
Documents in their capacity as such.

any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto).
ARTICLE IX
Guarantee
SECTION 9.01.      Guarantee (a) The Parent Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders and their respective successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns,
the prompt and complete payment and performance by the Subsidiary Borrowers when due (whether at the stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise) of the Subsidiary Obligations (other than, with respect to any Guarantor, any Excluded Swap
Obligations of such Guarantor). As used in this Article IX, the term “Lenders” includes affiliates of Lenders which are parties to
any Specified Cash Management Agreements or Specified Swap Agreements.
(b)      The Parent Borrower agrees that the Subsidiary Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed
the amount of the liability of the Parent Borrower hereunder that would exist in the absence of this Article IX without impairing
this Guarantee or affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder.
(c)      This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect until all the Subsidiary Obligations shall have been
satisfied by payment in full in immediately available funds and the Commitments shall be terminated, notwithstanding that from
time to time during the term of this Guarantee the Subsidiary Borrowers may be free from any Subsidiary Obligations.
(d)      No payment made by any Borrower, any Guarantor, any other guarantor or any other Person or received or
collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from any Borrower, any Guarantor, any other guarantor or any other Person
by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in reduction
of or in payment of the Subsidiary Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of the
Parent Borrower hereunder which shall, notwithstanding any such payment (other than any payment made by the Parent
Borrower in respect of the Subsidiary Obligations or any payment received or collected from the Parent Borrower in respect of
the Subsidiary Obligations), remain liable for the Subsidiary Obligations until the Subsidiary Obligations are paid in full in
immediately available funds and the Commitments are terminated.
SECTION 9.02.      No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment made by the Parent Borrower hereunder or any
set-off or application of funds of the Parent Borrower by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Parent Borrower shall not
be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Subsidiary Borrowers or
any other Guarantor or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for
the payment of the Subsidiary Obligations nor shall the Parent Borrower seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or
reimbursement from the Subsidiary Borrowers or any other Guarantor in respect of payments made by the Parent Borrower under
79


================================================================================
[PAGE 375 OF 401]
================================================================================
this Guarantee, until all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Subsidiary Borrowers on account of
the Subsidiary Obligations are paid in full in immediately available funds and the Commitments are terminated. If any amount
shall be paid to the Parent Borrower on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Subsidiary Obligations
shall not have been paid in full in immediately available funds, such amount shall be held by the Parent Borrower for the benefit
of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by the Parent Borrower, be turned over to the
Administrative Agent in the exact form received by the Parent Borrower (duly indorsed by the Parent Borrower to the
Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Subsidiary Obligations whether matured or unmatured, in such order
as the Administrative Agent may determine.
SECTION 9.03.      Amendments, etc. with respect to the Subsidiary Obligations. The Parent Borrower shall
remain obligated under this Guarantee notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against the Parent Borrower and
without notice to or further assent by the Parent Borrower, any demand for payment of any of the Subsidiary Obligations made
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and any of the
Subsidiary Obligations continued, and the Subsidiary Obligations or the liability of any other Person upon or for any part thereof,
or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part,
be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, and this Agreement and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith may be
amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, in accordance with Section 10.02, as the Administrative
Agent (or the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be) may deem advisable from time to time, and any collateral
security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the
Subsidiary Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released without affecting the Parent Borrower’s
obligations under this Article IX. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to protect, secure,
perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Subsidiary Obligations or for this Guarantee.
SECTION 9.04.      Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. The Parent Borrower waives any and all notice of the
creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Subsidiary Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee; the Subsidiary Obligations, and any of
them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in
reliance upon this Article IX; and all dealings between the Parent Borrower and any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to have been had or
consummated in reliance upon this Article IX. The Parent Borrower waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment
and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon the Subsidiary Borrowers or any of the Guarantors with respect to the Subsidiary
Obligations. The Parent Borrower understands and agrees that this Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and
unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any of the Subsidiary
Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to
time held by the
80


================================================================================
[PAGE 376 OF 401]
================================================================================
Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance)
which may at any time be available to or be asserted by any Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person against the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of any Borrower or any
Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Subsidiary Borrowers for
the Subsidiary Obligations, or of the Parent Borrower under this Article IX, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When making
any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against the Parent Borrower, the Administrative
Agent or any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and
remedies as it may have against the Subsidiary Borrowers, any other Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral
security or guarantee for the Subsidiary Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any
payments from any Subsidiary Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security
or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of any Subsidiary Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other
Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve the Parent Borrower of any obligation or
liability under this Article IX, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a
matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Parent Borrower under this Article IX. For the purposes
hereof “demand” shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.
SECTION 9.05.       Reinstatement. This Article IX shall continue to be effective, or shall be reinstated, as the case
may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Subsidiary Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be
restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or
reorganization of any Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or
conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, any Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or
otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.
SECTION 9.06.      Payments. The Parent Borrower hereby guarantees that payments hereunder will be paid to the
Administrative Agent without set-off or counterclaim in dollars or the applicable Alternative Currency at the office of the
Administrative Agent located at 10 South Dearborn Street, 7th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60603-2300 and to the following wire
instructions of the Administrative Agent (or such other address or wire instructions of the Administrative Agent that may be
provided from time to time by the Administrative Agent):

Beneficiary:    Loan Processing D.P.

SECTION 9.07.      Keepwell. Each Borrower Qualified Keepwell Provider hereby jointly and severally absolutely,
unconditionally, and irrevocably undertakes to provide
81


================================================================================
[PAGE 377 OF 401]
================================================================================
such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time for the Parent Borrower to qualify as an Eligible Contract
Participant during the Swap Guarantee Eligibility Period in respect of any Swap Obligation (provided, however, that each
Borrower Qualified Keepwell Provider shall only be liable under this Section 9.07 for the maximum amount of such liability that
can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 9.07, or otherwise under this Guarantee, voidable
under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations of
each Borrower Qualified Keepwell Provider under this Section 9.07 shall remain in full force and effect until the obligations of
the Borrowers under this Agreement have expired, been discharged or have otherwise been terminated in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Each Borrower Qualified Keepwell Provider intends that this Section 9.07 constitute, and this Section
9.07 shall be deemed to constitute, a “keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of the Parent Borrower for all
purposes of section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

(b) Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by using Electronic
Systems pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices
pursuant to Article II unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Lender. The Administrative Agent

Intralinks, Syndtrak, ClearPar or a substantially similar Electronic System.
(v)       Any Electronic System used by the Administrative Agent is provided “as is” and “as available.” The
Agent Parties (as defined below) do not warrant the adequacy of such Electronic Systems and expressly disclaim liability
for errors or omissions in the Communications. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including any
warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from
viruses or other code defects, is made by any Agent Party in connection with the Communications or any Electronic
System. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the “Agent Parties”) have
any liability to any Borrower or the other Loan Parties, any Lender or any other Person or entity for damages of any
kind, including direct or indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort,
contract or otherwise) arising out of the any Loan Party’s or the Administrative Agent’s transmission of communications

judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct
of, or material breach of its obligations under the Loan Documents by, such Agent Party. “Communications” means,

any Loan Party pursuant to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated therein which is distributed by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender by means of electronic communications pursuant to this Section, including through
an Electronic System.
SECTION 10.02.      Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right
or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
hereunder and under the Guarantee Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would
otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the Guarantee Agreement or consent to any departure by any
Borrower or any Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this
Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default,
regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
(b) Neither this Agreement nor the Guarantee Agreement nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived,
amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers or the Guarantors,
as the case may be, and the Required Lenders or by the Borrowers or the Guarantors, as the case may be, and the Administrative
Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any
Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest
thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the
scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce
the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the
written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.16(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata
sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) release all or substantially all of the
Guarantors from their obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, without the written consent of each Lender (except that no
approval of the Lenders shall be required to release a Guarantor in connection with the disposition of all the capital stock of such
Guarantor not prohibited by the Loan Documents) or (vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of
“Commitment”, the definition of “Required Lenders”, the definition of “Applicable Percentage” or any other provision hereof
specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any
determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; provided, further that no such
agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent without the prior written
84

================================================================================
consent of the Administrative Agent. If the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower acting together identify any ambiguity,
omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect in any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, then the
Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower shall be permitted to amend, modify or supplement such provision to cure such
ambiguity, omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect, and such amendment shall become effective without any
further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.
SECTION 10.03.      Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Parent Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable
and documented out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and the Lead Arrangers,
including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one domestic counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Lead
Arrangers, collectively, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof and (ii) all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, including the reasonable
fees, charges and disbursements of one domestic counsel and one foreign counsel, as necessary, in each applicable jurisdiction for
the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or preservation of its rights
in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with
the Loans made hereunder, including all such reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout,
restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans.
(b) The Parent Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Co-Documentation
Agents, the Lead Arrangers and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being
called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties
hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials
on or from any property owned or operated by the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability
related in any way to the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not such claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding is
brought by the Borrower or any other Loan Party or their respective equity holders, Affiliates, creditors or any other third Person
and whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that
such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related
expenses are found by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of, or material breach of its obligations under the Loan Documents by, such
Indemnitee or such Indemnitee’s employer or any Affiliate of either thereof or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, advisors or agents. Paragraph (b) of this Section
85


================================================================================
[PAGE 381 OF 401]
================================================================================
shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax
claim.
(c) To the extent that the Parent Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative
Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, but without affecting the Parent Borrower’s obligations thereunder, each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the
applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed
expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against
the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such.
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no party hereto shall assert, and each such party hereby waives, any
claim against any other party and any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the
proceeds thereof; provided that, nothing in this clause (d) shall relieve the Borrowers of any obligation they may have to
indemnify an Indemnitee against special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages asserted against such Indemnitee by a third
party.
(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.
SECTION 10.04.      Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) a Borrower may
not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and
any attempted assignment or transfer by a Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or
otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more
assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the
Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:
(A)     the Parent Borrower; provided that no consent of the Parent Borrower shall be required for an
assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender (provided that such Affiliate is a Swiss Qualifying Bank or a Swiss
Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank), an Approved Fund (provided that such Approved Fund is a Swiss Permitted Non-
Qualifying Bank) or, if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred

and is continuing, any other assignee; provided, further, that the Parent Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to
any such assignment unless the Parent Borrower shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within
ten Business Days after having received written notice thereof; and
(B)    the Administrative Agent.
(ii)     Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
(A)    except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the
entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the
assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect

ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or
an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.
(iii)     Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of
the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement
(including, in the case of any Non-U.S. Lender, obligations under Section 2.15(f)), and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to
the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14,
2.15 and 10.03); provided, however, that no such assignment or transfer shall be deemed to be a waiver of any rights which any
Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against such Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender
of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.04 shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with, and subject to the
conditions set forth in, paragraph (c) of this Section.
(iv)     The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its
offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from
time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and each Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof
as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available
for inspection by any Borrower and (solely with respect to the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Lender) any Lender, at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(v)     Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an
assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the
processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by
paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information
contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in
the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Parent Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell
participations to one or more banks or other entities (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations, (C) the relevant Participant

will have no proprietary interest in the benefit of this Agreement or in any monies received by such Lender under or in relation to
this Agreement, (D) the relevant Participant will under no circumstances be subrogated to, or substituted in respect of, such
Lender's claims under this Agreement or have otherwise any contractual relationship with, or rights against, any Borrower under,
or in relation to, this Agreement (except as set forth in the following sentence with regards to benefits that each Participant is
entitled to under Sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired an interest by assignment
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section) and (E) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole
right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (v) and (vi) of the first proviso to Section 10.02(b)
that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant shall also be entitled to the
benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.16(c) as though it
were a Lender; provided that, the foregoing sentence shall not apply to Ralph Lauren Europe Sàrl. Each Lender that sells a
participation, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain a register on which it enters
the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans
or other obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to
disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information
relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the
extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under
Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive, and
such Lender, each Loan Party and the Administrative Agent shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant
Register pursuant to the terms hereof as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding
notice to the contrary.
(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15 unless such Participant shall
have complied with the requirements of such Section; provided, that in any case in which a Participant is so entitled, any such
Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender would
have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
Participant is made with the Parent Borrower's prior written consent, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater
payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. A Participant that
would be a Non-U.S. Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless the Parent Borrower is
notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant

Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no
such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall (i) release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any
such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto (ii) require any payments to be made by any Borrower or grant to any
person any more extensive rights than those required to be made or granted to the relevant Lender under the Loan Documents, or
(iii) upon any enforcement of such pledge or assignment of a security interest, result in any assignment, transfer or sub-
participation of any such rights under the Loan Documents which is in breach of this Clauses (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 10.04.
SECTION 10.05.      Survival. All representations and warranties made by the Borrowers herein and the other
Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans, and shall terminate at such time as no
principal of or accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement (other than contingent
indemnification obligations that are not due and payable) is outstanding and unpaid and the Commitments have expired or been
terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 10.03, 10.13 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and
effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or
termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
SECTION 10.06.      Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. (a) This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken
together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement and any separate letter agreements with
respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter
hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.
Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together,

other Loan Document or such Ancillary Document, as applicable; provided that nothing herein shall require the Administrative
Agent to accept Electronic Signatures in any form or format without its prior written consent and pursuant to procedures
approved by it; provided, further, without limiting the foregoing, (i) to the extent the Administrative Agent has agreed to accept
any Electronic Signature, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on such Electronic Signature

to this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document shall be deemed to include Electronic Signatures,
deliveries or the keeping of records in any electronic form (including deliveries by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic
means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page), each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or
enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as

provisos in the first sentence of this Section 10.06(b), (i) agrees that, for all purposes, including without limitation, in connection
with any workout, restructuring, enforcement of remedies, bankruptcy proceedings or litigation among the Administrative Agent,

deemed created in the ordinary course of such Person’s business, and destroy the original paper document (and all such electronic
records shall be considered an original for all purposes and shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper
record), (iii) waives any argument, defense or right to contest the legal effect, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any
other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document based solely on the lack of paper original copies of this Agreement, such
other Loan Document and/or such Ancillary Document, respectively, including with respect to any signature pages thereto and
(iv) waives any claim against any Lender and its related parties for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses

transmissions (to the extent permitted by Section 10.01 and the first sentence of this Section 10.06(b)) by telecopy, emailed pdf.
or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page, including any losses, claims,

================================================================================
[PAGE 387 OF 401]
================================================================================
the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such
provision in any other jurisdiction.
SECTION 10.08.      Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender
and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off

obligations of any Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not
such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured; provided that,
to the extent prohibited by applicable law as described in the definition of “Excluded Swap Obligation”, no amounts received
from, or set off with respect to, any Guarantor shall be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligations of such Guarantor. The rights

FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY

EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE

SECTION 10.12.      Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates’
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors, in each case who have a need
to know such Information in accordance with customary banking practices (it being understood that the Persons to whom such
disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any Governmental Authority (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners) (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any
subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies
hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an

counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to any Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the
consent of the Parent Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a
breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a
source other than a Borrower which is not subject to a
93


================================================================================
[PAGE 389 OF 401]
================================================================================
confidentiality obligation known to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to such information. For the purposes
of this Section, “Information” means all information received from any Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to such Borrower,
any Subsidiary or their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by such Borrower or any Subsidiary and other than information pertaining
to this Agreement routinely provided by arrangers to data service providers, including league table providers, that serve the
lending industry; provided that, in the case of information received from any Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof,
such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality
of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.
SECTION 10.13.      Satisfaction in Applicable Currency. (a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any
court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the
fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal
banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Business
Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.
(b) The obligation of each Borrower hereunder to make payments in a currency (the “Agreement Currency”) shall,
notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than the Agreement Currency, be discharged only
to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of any sum adjudged to be
so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may in accordance with normal banking procedures
in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement
Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the Agreement
Currency, the applicable Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the
Administrative Agent and each Lender (as an alternative or additional cause of action) against such loss (if any) and if the
amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in
the Agreement Currency, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree to remit such excess to the applicable Borrower. The
obligations of each Borrower contained in this Section 10.13 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of
all other amounts owing hereunder.
SECTION 10.14.      Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties,

extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution
Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:the application of any Write-Down and
Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by
any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and
94


================================================================================
[PAGE 390 OF 401]
================================================================================
(b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
(i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected
Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and
that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such
liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
(iii)the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers
of the applicable Resolution Authority.
SECTION 10.15.      No Fiduciary Duty. The Administrative Agent, each Lender and their Affiliates (collectively,
solely for purposes of this paragraph, the “Lenders”), may have economic interests that conflict with those of each of the
Borrowers, its stockholders and/or its affiliates.  Each Borrower agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be
deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Lender, on the one
hand, and any Borrower, its stockholders or its affiliates, on the other.  Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are
arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrowers, on the other, and (ii) in
connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in
favor of any Borrower, its stockholders or its affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of
rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is
currently advising or will advise any Borrower, its stockholders or its Affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to any
Borrower except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender is acting solely as principal and
not as the agent or fiduciary of any Borrower, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person.  Each Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it
is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto.  Each
Borrower agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary
or similar duty to such Borrower, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
SECTION 10.16.      USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby notifies the
Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107‑56 (signed into law October
26, 2001)) (the “Patriot Act”), such Lender and Agent is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the
Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of the Borrowers and other information that will allow such Lender
or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. The Borrowers shall
provide such information and take such actions as are reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in order
to assist the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in maintaining compliance with the Patriot Act.

================================================================================
SECTION 10.17.      Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide
support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Swap Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such
support “QFC Credit Support” and each such QFC a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with
respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the
“U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below
applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of
the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):
In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a
proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit
Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in
property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same
extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit
Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the
United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a
U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC
or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent
than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan
Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it
is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the
rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
