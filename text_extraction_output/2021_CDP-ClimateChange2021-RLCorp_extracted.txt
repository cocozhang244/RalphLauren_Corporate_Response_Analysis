Ralph Lauren Corporation - Climate Change 2021
C0. Introduction
C0.1
(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
Founded in 1967 by Mr. Ralph Lauren, we are a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear,
accessories, home furnishings, fragrances, and hospitality. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across an expanding number of products,
brands, sales channels, and international markets. We believe that our global reach, breadth of product offerings, and multi-channel distribution are unique among luxury and
apparel companies.
Our global reach is extensive, as we sell directly to customers throughout the world via our 548 retail stores and 650 concession-based shop-within-shops, as well as through
our own digital commerce sites and those of various third-party digital partners. Merchandise is also available through our wholesale distribution channels at approximately
9,000 doors worldwide, the majority in specialty stores, as well as through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers. In addition to our directly-operated
stores and shops, our international licensing partners operate 139 Ralph Lauren stores and shops, and 143 Club Monaco stores and shops.
For more than 50 years, Ralph Lauren has inspired the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style, and we approach citizenship & sustainability with this in
mind. This core purpose informs our every day at Ralph Lauren and extends across our entire business. It is inextricably linked to how we create a better future for our
Company, the people we come into contact with and the world.
Two years ago, we launched our renewed citizenship and sustainability strategy, Design the Change. Our strategy was built on the values and purpose that have defined our
business for more than half a century, and it is based on our belief that together with our industry, we can deliver the change required to create a positive impact in society and
a more sustainable future. 
When we set out on our journey to Design the Change, we set ambitious goals and dedicated ourselves to integrating our strategy into every part of our business with a clear
focus on three pillars: Creating Timeless Style, Protecting the Environment, and Championing Better Lives.
We are two years into our journey and while we, along with the world, face an unprecedented challenge and global crisis, we are optimistic about the future and are committed
to doing what we can to create a better tomorrow.
Design the Change accelerates our work across Global Citizenship & Sustainability. Fundamentally, we believe that together with our industry, we can deliver the change
required to create a positive impact in society and a more sustainable future. In June 2020, Ralph Lauren signed onto the United Nations Global Compact, joining other
companies across industries committed to implementing universal sustainability principles. 
Through Design the Change, we:
· Create Timeless Style: We believe one of our greatest commitments to sustainability is designing products worn, loved and made to last. We are committed to responsible
sourcing and using state-of-the-art materials that allow us to create our products more sustainably, without compromising the quality we’re known for.
· Protect the Environment: We’re using partnerships and technology to reduce the environmental impact of our operations and supply chain across energy, emissions, water
and waste. We believe collaboration is key to finding solutions, which is why we joined leading groups and support nonprofits dedicated to mitigating the environmental
impacts of business.
· Champion Better Lives: We aim to positively affect the lives of those touched by our business, including people in our communities, workforce and supply chain.
Risks and opportunities described herein with the potential to have a ‘substantive financial or strategic impact on our business’ are not necessarily ‘material’ to investors as
defined by the SEC.

(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
In our corporate Enterprise Risk Management process, risks rating criteria are used to assess the extent to which a risk event may affect the company’s strategy, finances,
operations, and/or reputation. We consider any risks rated as “critical” or “high” to have a substantive financial or strategy impact on our business. A critical risk is defined as
having one or more of the following impacts: (1) a very high impact on the company’s ability to meet strategic goals or execute priority initiatives; (2) leading to greater than
$700 million impact on revenue or $70 million impact on our operating margin; (3) a national, sustained, negative reputational damage with stakeholders; or (4) leading to
severe and potentially long-term impact on the operations of our business. A “high” risk is defined as having one or more of the following impacts: (1) a high impact on the
company’s ability to meet strategy goals or execute priority initiatives; (2) leading to between $350 million and $700 million impact on revenue or between $35 million and $70
million impact on our operating margin; (3) a national, short-term, negative reputational damage with stakeholders; or (4) leading to significant impact on the operations of our
business. Risks and opportunities described herein with the potential to have a "substantive financial or strategic impact on our business’ are not necessarily ‘material’ to
investors as defined by the SEC.

Description of process
Ralph Lauren’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process is used to identify and plan responses to ensure the health and life of the business enterprise and successfully
prepare our company to face any risk event, including those presented by climate change. Our ERM process currently involves identifying broad ESG sustainability risks,
creating rankings of importance for each risk, and creating mitigation plans for certain risks. We primarily focus on risks within each fiscal year, rather than long-term risks.
As part of this annual ERM assessment, our Senior Vice President for Internal Audit & Asset Protection initiates this process by meeting with leadership of different
business units (e.g., Chief Supply Chain Officer, Chief Sustainability Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, etc.) and gathers a list of risks that each business unit has identified.
From this full list, our ERM team conducts an exercise to rank risks based on the perceived potential impact of each risk and the company’s vulnerability to that risk. This
ranking is benchmarked against the previous year’s ERM results and discussed with business unit managers to fine-tune these rankings. For each risk identified, the ERM
team works with business unit leaders to create mitigation plans for each risk. For ESG risks, this involves engaging our Chief Sustainability Officer to develop mitigation
plans, including for those related to climate change. For top risks, our Senior Vice President for Internal Audit & Asset Protection assigns a risk owner to manage the risk
and report to the Board of Directors quarterly. Through the ERM process, climate change has been identified as an ESG risk that requires a more granular assessment
process. To conduct this detailed climate risk assessment, we created a cross-functional Ralph Lauren Climate Risk Taskforce, designed to make the company more
resilient to evolving risks presented by climate change. On a semiannual basis, the taskforce develops and updates a Climate Risk Report to: (1) identify key climate risks;
(2) describe the risks, the level of impact, and likelihood, and ensure key actions are being taken to address risks; and (3) communicate climate risks to key stakeholders,
including our leadership team and Board of Directors. The Climate Risk Taskforce is responsible for preparing the semiannual Climate Risk Report and for developing inputs
for other internal and external reporting on climate risk, including ERM and this CDP Climate Change questionnaire. The Taskforce includes representatives from the
following teams/business units: sustainability, internal audit/risk, logistics, sourcing, investor relations, store operations/asset protection, global risk, communications,
finance, and legal. The Climate Risk Report is reviewed by our Global Citizenship & Sustainability Steering Committee, who is responsible for ensuring climate risk is built
into our operating model and business strategy. The Climate Risk Report is then presented to the Board of Directors, where the Nominating, Governance, Citizenship and
Sustainability Committee is responsible for oversight of sustainability and ESG matters, including climate risk. To assess climate risks, the Taskforce describes risks
according to the following categories: where the risk occurs, risk type, risk driver, time horizon, likelihood, magnitude of impact, financial impact, and key actions to mitigate
risk. Financial impact is evaluated according to the financial impact criteria used in our corporate ERM process across four tiers of impact to our revenue and operating
margin. In developing the Climate Risk Report, the Taskforce identified both climate-related physical risks and climate-related transitional risks. The most critical climate-
related physical risk identified by the Taskforce come from extreme weather impacts on the availability and cost of raw materials, largely driven by the impact of climate
change on cotton production. We are responding to this climate-related risk by implementing a sourcing strategy focused on near-shoring, geographic diversification, and
the use of sustainable materials. This strategy will help mitigate potential increases in raw material costs due to extreme weather events in one sourcing country or region
by allowing us to more easily shift our sourcing to other countries or regions. Specifically, we have set a goal to switch to 100 percent sustainable sourced key materials by
2025, including cotton that is either from the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), Fair Trade certified, organic, recycled, transitional, or aligned to the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol.
The Taskforce also identified climate-related transitional risks, including the need to transition to lower emissions technology to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions
impact of our operations and supply chain in line with our goal of reducing our absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 30% by 2030 from our FY20 baseline. To address
the technological challenges of transitioning to a low-carbon business model, we are investing in technologies that have the potential to reduce the emissions of our
products, such as our use of ECOFAST™ Pure Sustainable Textile Treatment, a pre-treatment solution developed by Dow for cotton textiles. When used with existing
dyeing equipment, ECOFAST™ Pure enables the use of less water, chemicals, and energy, reducing the carbon footprint of products compared to traditional cotton dyeing
processes.

Please explain
Current
regulation
Relevant,
always
included
Current regulations are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. An
example of a current regulatory risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is the move to low-Sulphur fuel oil (LSFO) across the
globe as mandated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and all its member countries. LSFO is a higher-grade fuel, so it costs more to refine and therefore could cause an
abrupt shift in energy costs, impacting our costs for shipping goods.
Emerging
regulation
Relevant,
always
included
Emerging regulations are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. An
example of an emerging regulatory risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is a potential carbon tax. Ralph Lauren may
become affected by carbon taxes and other pricing schemes that affect the cost of energy for facility operations and the cost of fuel for logistics.
Technology Relevant,
always
included
Technology risks are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. An example
of a technology risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is deploying technologies necessary for achieving our greenhouse
gas reduction commitments. We are investing in technologies that will allow us to reduce the carbon footprint of our products and supply chain in order to achieve our greenhouse gas
reduction target.
Legal
Relevant,
always
included
Legal risks are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. We have
monitored legal risks related to climate change, such as not adhering to national climate laws, but we have not yet been affected by climate-related litigation.
Market
Relevant,
always
included
Market risks are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. An example of a
market risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is increased costs of raw materials. Chronic changes in weather can affect
the availability, quality, and price of the raw materials that Ralph Lauren depends on.
Reputation
Relevant,
always
included
Reputational risks are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. An example
of a reputational risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is perceived inaction on climate change. We have responded to this
risk by working to set meaningful commitments to combat climate change, including a science-based greenhouse gas reduction target and a commitment to source 100% renewable
electricity from our owned and operated facilities.
Acute
physical
Relevant,
always
included
Acute physical risks are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. An
example of an acute physical risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is business disruptions in our operations, sales
channels, and manufacturing and distribution networks as a result of increased severity of extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods.
Chronic
physical
Relevant,
always
included
Chronic physical risks are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. An
example of a chronic physical risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is reduced revenue from decreased production
capacity (e.g., transport difficulties, supply chain interruptions) as a result of changes in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns.

Company-specific description
Chronic changes in weather can affect the availability, quality, and price of the raw materials that Ralph Lauren depends on. One of the major raw materials in Ralph
Lauren’s products is cotton, which is a crop that is known to be affected by variation in annual rainfall and extreme precipitation, such as hail. In FY21, cotton consisted of
over 80 percent of our material use. This may impact the communities and people that grow cotton, leading to a reduction in the supply of cotton and/or shifts in the key
cotton-producing regions, which could affect material prices and quality.

Explanation of financial impact figure
Our Climate Risk Taskforce evaluated the financial impact of this risk according to the financial impact criteria used in our corporate Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
process across four tiers of impact to our revenue and operating margin. This risk has been assigned the lowest financial impact category, with an estimated revenue impact
of less than $70 million. This estimate is based on our assessment of potential financial impacts from fluctuations in the cost of cotton. Recent internal analysis has shown
that we could see a 20-30% increase in the cost of cotton from overall market shifts. However, these market shifts have not translated to increases to our costs of goods
sold due to elements of our sourcing strategy mitigating this variability, including origin country shifts, and consolidation of materials and suppliers.
Cost of response to risk
Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
The financial impact of this risk can be mitigated through our sourcing strategy. This includes strategies to achieve balanced diversified country allocation, near shoring, and
localization of materials.

Company-specific description
We have operations, including retail, distribution, and warehousing operations, in locations subject to natural disasters, such as severe weather caused by climate change,
any of which could disrupt our operations. This includes major facilities in the East Coast of the United States, located in states such as New York, New Jersey, and North
Carolina that have been subject to hurricanes, floods, and other extreme weather events in the past ten years. The occurrence of natural disasters or other catastrophic
events may result in sudden disruptions in the business operations of the local economies affected, as well as of the regional and global economies. Any of these events
could result in decreased demand for our products and disruptions in our sales channels and manufacturing and distribution networks, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, as storms become more severe and higher than average rainfall occurs as a result of
climate change, the facilities operated by Ralph Lauren may experience business disruptions, expenses, and other financial impacts, as well as costs to protect and retrofit
existing facilities to be more resilient to extreme weather events. This also includes an increase in philanthropic contributions to relief organizations in response to natural
disasters that occur in countries where we operate.

of less than $70 million. This estimate is based on our assessment of potential financial impacts from preparing for and responding to weather impacts on our operations.
This includes historical and anticipated costs for physical resources (sandbags, plywood, flood barriers) and expenses associated with damage and repairs to our facilities
as a result of extreme weather events.
Cost of response to risk
Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
The financial impact of this risk can be mitigated through business teams pre-planning—both physical resources (sandbags, plywood, flood barriers) and financial resources
to further prepare. Additionally, business considerations like impact-resistant windows at all locations within 50 miles of coastal areas will mitigate severe damage.

An increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events could affect Ralph Lauren’s logistics supply chain, including transporting goods from finished goods
suppliers to distribution centers and then to customers. We rely upon third-party transportation providers for virtually all our product shipments, including shipments to and
from our distribution centers, to our stores and shop-within-shops, and to our digital commerce and wholesale customers. Our utilization of these shipping services are
subject to various risks, including severe weather caused by climate change. For example, in the past year several ships carrying our product have experienced extreme
weather during Pacific Ocean crossings leading to delays in the supply chain and delivery of our products. Weather events that lead to transportation infrastructure damage
and flooding cause disruptions that can affect revenue by decreasing transportation availability and increasing wages and fuel prices, which could result in higher
transportation costs.

As Ralph Lauren’s suppliers become more innovative and able to drive efficiencies in processes, material usage, water, and energy consumption, there are opportunities to
reduce cost. For example, this year we announced Color on Demand, a multi-phased system with a clear ambition to deliver the world’s first scalable zero wastewater
cotton dyeing system. As part of the first phase of Color on Demand, Ralph Lauren optimized the use of ECOFAST™ Pure Sustainable Textile Treatment, a pre-treatment
solution developed by Dow for cotton textiles. When used with existing dyeing equipment, ECOFAST™ Pure enables the use of up to 40% less water, 85% fewer
chemicals, 90% less energy and a 60% reduction in carbon footprint compared to traditional cotton dyeing processes. We are integrating this process into our supply chain
and will launch product using this technology later in 2021. By 2025, we aim to use the Color on Demand platform in more than 80% of our solid cotton products, leading to
cost savings and GHG reductions in upstream production.

Ralph Lauren’s climate strategy includes development of low emission products and materials. We are currently using and aiming to increase the use of recycled content for
both synthetic and natural fibers, as well as cotton grown with less chemical inputs and irrigation water than conventional cotton. Our strategy also includes the use of
regeneratively grown fibers and materials to support carbon drawdown by healthy soils. In FY21, 33% of our units produced met our sustainable material criteria. This year
we announced a comprehensive circularity strategy to further advance sustainability goals. As part of the strategy, we are entering a partnership with McDonough
Innovation to achieve Cradle to Cradle certification™, a globally recognized measure of safer, more sustainable products, with some of our most iconic products. We will
also continue to invest in scalable technologies that will elevate the quality of recycled materials so that they are of the same high quality and feel as virgin material. In
2020, Ralph Lauren invested in Natural Fiber Welding, a leading sustainable material science startup that is scaling a new industry standard for natural fiber recycling. As
part of this commitment, Ralph Lauren will produce 100% recycled cotton products across our portfolio by 2025. As we develop new and expanded circular and low
emissions products, this could result in a competitive advantage, brand preference, and brand loyalty among customers.

climate-related scenario analysis to inform our strategy in the coming year. This includes establishing a Climate Risk Taskforce, comprised of members of our sustainability,
internal audit/risk, logistics, sourcing, investor relations, store operations/asset protection, global risk, communications, finance, and legal teams. This taskforce will be
responsible for preparing a semiannual Climate Risk Report and developing inputs for internal and external report on climate risk, including our Enterprise Risk Management
(ERM) process. In anticipation of conducting climate-related scenario analysis in the next year, we have started using the GESI-CDP Scenario Analysis Toolkit and have

We take a holistic approach to sourcing preferred fibers and materials for our products, including the consideration of climate-related risks and opportunities. For example, our leather
strategy has been influenced by several factors, including animal welfare, processing impacts, deforestation potential, and climate risks. Our goal in the medium-term (i.e., in the next
four years) is to source leather from traceable supply chains where cattle ranchers are certified to animal welfare standards, verified deforestation-free, and the hides are processed by
Leather Working Certified tanneries to achieve our target of sourcing 100 percent sustainably key materials by 2025. However, we recognize the limitations to this ideal supply chain
based on current complexities and opaqueness of the leather commodity market and the lack of traceability infrastructure. While our goal remains the same, we have tailored our
strategy to reach greater impact at scale and on a faster timeline than it would take to source all Ralph Lauren’s leather from traceable suppliers. To reach this scale and help the
industry build capacity of deforestation-free and animal welfare certified leather, we will be investing in the Leather Impact Accelerator’s Impact Incentives. Decoupled from product, our
investment in Impact Incentives will reduce deforestation of primary forests, preserving intact and functioning ecosystems that are vital to drawing down carbon. While we invest in
Impact Incentives, we will also begin to source leather from regenerative ranchers. Although we will start with small volumes, we believe that regenerative grazing is essential to restoring
grassland health and sequestering carbon to mitigate climate risks. We’re creating partnerships to procure hides where the ranching operations are verified to the Ecological Outcome
Verification to ensure ecosystem regeneration.
Supply

chain
Yes
Based on our assessment of our GHG emissions and climate risks within our supply chain, we established a roadmap to drive significant GHG reductions and risk mitigation in our
manufacturing. It has become clear that in order to deliver on our ambitious roadmap, we need to work closely with our suppliers to align their climate agenda, focus, and priorities with
those of our organization. As part of this roadmap, in FY20, we launched our new Supplier Engagement Strategy to establish and maintain collaborative partnerships and systems that
foster increased transparency and accountability. Our Supplier Engagement Strategy is built on our long-term strategic approach for value creation (i.e., over the next five to ten years).
Our sustainability criteria include considerations that can be used in the future to mitigate risks from climate change in our supply base. For example, we strive for geographical diversity
in our key and strategic suppliers, which will support our efforts to mitigate the risk of disruptions in our supply chain from climate change. With over 40% of our total scope 1, 2, and 3
emissions coming from manufacturing, helping our manufacturers achieve significant emissions reductions will be critical for achieving our science-based GHG emissions target. As a
first step in this process, we are engaging our suppliers through the Higg Index Facility Environmental Module (FEM) to monitor their energy use and emissions data to drive
improvement. We also supported our largest fabric manufacturers to participate in the Mill impact Initiative run by the Apparel Impact Institute (Aii). The Initiative applies Clean by Design
methodology and drives the reduction of environmental impacts in the manufacturing process, including the carbon, water, and chemical footprint of textile production. The result of the
Higg Index FEM assessment including the energy performance and emissions is incorporated to the supplier evaluation scorecard (as part of the Supplier Engagement Strategy
framework), which informs business decisions and supplier segmentation. We are working with Aii and other partners to support our suppliers in establishing an energy and carbon
reduction strategy and roadmap to begin achieving emissions reductions in our supply chain in the near term (i.e., in the next two years).
Investment
in R&D
Yes
Our Product and Business Model Innovation Teams invest and drive adoption of technologies and platforms that reduce the use of virgin raw materials, increase energy and resource
use efficiency, and prolong the life and durability of our products. These investments have the potential to lead to increased revenues resulting from cost savings as well as innovation in
sustainable customer offerings. Through the execution of our strategy of R&D investment, we expect to realize these opportunities in the medium-term (i.e., in the next two to five years).
This includes a minority investment in Natural Fiber Welding, Inc. (NFW), a leading sustainable material science startup that has revolutionized the reuse of natural fibers – such as
cotton waste – into patented, high-performance materials. Through this investment, we are looking to expand our use of recycled post-consumer cotton, helping to advance our progress
toward sustainable sourcing of 100% of our key materials, including cotton, by 2025 and integrating zero-waste principles across our business. Over time, the partnership will enable us
to replace and reduce our reliance on non-biodegradable synthetics, such as polyester and nylon, while scaling the use of more sustainable and upcycled materials.
Operations Yes
Ralph Lauren may become affected by carbon taxes and other pricing schemes that affect the cost of purchased electricity consumed at our offices, stores, and distribution centers. At
the same time, Ralph Lauren will need to deploy lower emissions technologies in order to achieve our greenhouse gas reduction commitments and to meet our commitment to source
100% renewable electricity in our direct operations by 2025 (i.e., in the next four years). This includes overcoming constraints in our facilities and lease arrangements to deploy energy
efficiency technologies and source renewable power. To mitigate potential increases in the costs non-renewable electricity and potential future carbon taxes applied to non-renewable
electricity consumption, we have developed a global strategy for sourcing renewable electricity across our owned and operated facilities and have begun engaging various teams
throughout our business to execute this strategy. A key aspect of our strategy will be signing one or more virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) in North America and Europe.
When fully implemented, these long-term agreements will provide us with renewable energy attribute certificates equivalent to the majority of our annual global electricity consumption,
mitigating the risk of carbon taxes from non-renewable electricity consumption. In evaluating VPPAs, we have convened a cross-functional working group that draws on the perspective
and expertise of members of our sustainability, procurement, legal, tax, accounting, and finance business functions. To date, the contributions of the members of the working groups has
informed the definition of key commercial terms and go-to-market strategy for sourcing a VPPA in North America and will continue to further evaluate specific projects and developers as
our source strategy progresses.

Please explain (including target coverage)
In FY20, we established a science-based target to reduce our absolute GHG emissions by 30 percent by 2030, compared to 2020 levels. This target includes reducing
emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity and reducing emissions from our supply chain (scope 3). Our goal was
approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), indicating that our ambitions align with reduction pathways to limit global temperature rise across the planet to
1.5°C. The goal is consistent with our commitment as a signatory to the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action to achieve a 30 percent aggregate GHG emission
reductions in scope 1, 2, and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standard by 2030, against a baseline of no earlier than 2015. The goal is also consistent with our
membership in RE100. Setting a value chain carbon reduction target is a significant milestone for Ralph Lauren. We believe that companies must establish ambitious,
science-based targets to ensure that society averts the disruptive effects of climate change. Our commitment represents our long-standing values, reflects the evolution of
our thinking and will help decarbonize the fashion industry. We are in the process of implementing a detailed plan to achieve our goal by sourcing renewable energy for our
operations and reducing the carbon intensity of raw materials, manufacturing, and production in our supply chain. Ralph Lauren’s annual carbon footprints are aligned with
our fiscal years. The baseline year of our science-based target is aligned with FY20, which ran from April 2019 to March 2020. However, the target language of the SBTi
specifies 2030 as the target year. Due to our reporting cycle being misaligned with the reporting year, we’re aiming to achieve our 2030 goal in our FY31 reporting, which will
cover April 2030 to March 2031.

Is this target part of an emissions target?
Yes, Abs1. In FY20, we established a science-based target to reduce our absolute GHG emissions by 30 percent by 2030, compared to 2020 levels. This target includes
reducing emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity.
Is this target part of an overarching initiative?
RE100
Please explain (including target coverage)
In FY20, we joined RE100 and committed to the goal of powering our owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100 percent renewable electricity by
2025. As of FY21, 6% percent of electricity used in our operations was from renewable sources. We expect this number to significantly increase as we put our renewable
energy strategy into action.

Emissions calculation methodology
Emissions from the Purchased Goods and Services are the largest contributor to Ralph Lauren’s Scope 3 footprint and comprise 3/4 of the total Scope 3 footprint.
Emissions in this category were comprised of three main elements: raw materials, factory emissions, and other non-merch spend. Raw material weights were gathered and
appropriate MSI Higg emission factors were used to find raw material emissions. Higg FEM factory energy data was gathered from 2019 and processed to find emissions
from verified sources associated with Ralph Lauren (using a percentage of production for each factory dedicated to Ralph Lauren). An outlier process then cleaned the data
and then the data was scaled up to account for all factories in Ralph Lauren’s supply chain. Finally, spend on other non-merch goods and services was classified by
category according to Defra spend emission factors and emissions were then calculated.

Use of Sold Products emissions were calculated by first classifying the number of units sold by Ralph Lauren in the reporting year into various categories, such as dress
shirts, knits, or baby accessories. Then, each unit sold was given an average kWh/lifetime value due to washing, drying, and ironing (if applicable) by assuming its weight,
the energy use of the average appliance, and the lifespan of the product. These energy values were converted to emissions using average emission factors for each split-
out region (North America, Asia, and Europe) and the emissions were applied to each product category. Note that many goods sold by Ralph Lauren are not washed, dried,
or ironed, so there are no emissions associated with them in this category.

In FY21, we expanded the use of renewable energy throughout our operations. In FY20, we primarily used renewable electricity in France, as well as in Italy
and Switzerland to a lesser extent – this year, we expanded to the United Kingdom, Belgium, and the United States. This lowered our market-based emissions
due to shifting more electricity to a zero-emission factor. The formula used for calculating the percent reduction was (The change in emissions / previous year

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
The success of our climate strategy requires engagement with our suppliers to reduce emissions throughout our supply chain. The first step to integrating our suppliers into
our strategy is to ensure they are complying with our code of conduct. Each supplier is required to sign our Vendor Compliance Packet (VCP) which details our code of
conduct. This legal document also features our sustainability policy. We incorporated our climate commitment into our supply chain and materials sustainability policy which
therefore covers all suppliers and licensees.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
We have committed to 30% reduction in absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by 2030 compared to a FY20 baseline. Through our Vendor Compliance Packet (VCP),
our suppliers are made aware of our sustainability policy, and are expected to comply with the requirements set therein as they sign the agreement. In FY21, we further
integrated citizenship and sustainability into our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES), and launched our Vendor Management System (VMS), a database that enables us to
share information and opportunities with all tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers. As part of our Supplier Engagement Strategy, we integrated citizenship and sustainability into our
supplier evaluation scorecard, where sustainable materials, chemical management, water stewardship, and climate performance now sit alongside other business-critical
issues such as quality.

fabric manufacturers through the Higg Index FEM. We also rolled out third-party verification of the FEM data in accordance with protocols set by the Sustainable Apparel
Coalition (SAC). While we require all suppliers to share Higg FEM verified-data with us, in FY21, 47% of the active factories representing 77% of total business spend had
shared their data with us, including our strategic and key suppliers. We continue to invest in efforts to increase visibility to our supply chain climate and environmental data
through expanding the adoption of Higg FEM and third party verification in partnership with the SAC and Higg Co.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
We are committed to the industry’s collective effort to increase visibility of environmental and climate data monitoring and drive the adoption of manufacturing best practices.
Through the Higg Index Facility Environmental Module (FEM), we gain visibility to our supplier’s environmental data on an annual basis. The data is used to monitor our
footprint and progress made over time. In FY21, we collected data from 230 tier 1 facilities, representing 77 percent of our supply chain spend—an increase from 63 percent
last year. Within the reporting facilities, 103 (50 percent of our supply chain spend) have completed data verification by a SAC-approved third party. Facilities scored an
average of 46 points across all sections, with an average of 54 points in the water section and 71 in the energy section. During the year, we expanded our rollout of FEM to
cover 31 mills, representing approximately 21 percent and 32 percent of our woven and knit fabric production, respectively. A total of 25 mills have completed third-party
verification, with an average score of 49 points. We continue to invest in efforts to increase visibility to our supply chain climate and environmental data through expanding
the adoption of Higg FEM and third party verification in partnership with the SAC and Higg Co.

Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) aims to achieve mutual, long-term, positive impacts across our supply chain. This requires enduring partnerships based on
transparency and trust. The SES provides a framework for us in building and maintaining these partnerships. It enables us to develop performance-based supply chain
segmentation, as well as drive continuous improvement and positive impact that are based on shared transparency, accountability and value creation. In FY21, we
communicate our expectations of responsible practices with all suppliers, and seek feedback from suppliers on their expectations on us as a responsible partner, starting
with our strategic and key supplier segments, which represent a majority of our business. Currently, 50% of our business is with the strategic and key suppliers (21% of
suppliers by number), and we are aiming to grow to 80% by 2025. We integrated sustainability into our supplier performance evaluation scorecard where climate, water,
and chemical management performance sit alongside other business-critical issues such as quality. The sustainability performance is a substantial contributor to the
supplier’s overall performance evaluation scorecard, which is used to inform business decisions and segmentation. In FY22, we plan to expand our SES and supplier
performance evaluation to all suppliers.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) provides a framework for us to build and maintain mutual, long-term partnerships with our suppliers. The performance-based
supply chain segmentation takes into account the supplier’s performance in sustainability metrics, including climate, water stewardship, and sustainable chemicals
management. Our strategic and key supplier segments are held to a higher degree of expectations and are incentivized through growing business and transparency. We
rely on our partnership with the suppliers to drive reductions in our Scope 3 – manufacturing footprint to achieve our Science Based Target. We continue to invest in
programs and initiatives that support our supply partners in setting up and implementing sustainability and climate roadmap that aligns with or exceed our goals. We are
committed through the UNFCCC Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action to continuously pursue energy efficiency measures and renewable energy in our value chain.
We also partner with organizations including Aii to support the implementation of low carbon manufacturing initiatives, through which, we collaborate with our suppliers and
support them on establishing an energy and carbon reduction roadmap as part of the initiatives. Our Product and Business Model Innovation Teams invest and drive
adoption of technologies and platforms that increase energy and resource use efficiency and prolong the life and durability of our products.

Impact of engagement, including measures of success
We have committed to 30% reduction in absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by 2030 compared to a FY20 baseline. We work closely with our suppliers to increase
visibility into climate and environmental data tracking and monitoring through the Higg Index FEM and ZDHC tools, and in establishing an energy and carbon reduction
roadmap through the collaborative programs with our industry partners. Our Product and Business Model Innovation Teams invest and drive adoption of technologies and
platforms that increase energy and resource use efficiency and prolong the life and durability of our products. In FY21, we brought together four leading innovators in their
respective fields—Dow, Jeanologia, Huntsman Textile Effects and COROB—to reimagine each stage of the coloring process and join a shared mission to create a more
sustainable and efficient system for cotton dyeing. The result is Color on Demand. This new multi-phased platform is composed of a set of innovative technologies that will
enable the recycling and reuse of all water from the dyeing process, establishing the world’s first scalable zero wastewater cotton dyeing system. In addition to significant
water savings, Color on Demand dramatically reduces the amount of chemicals, dye, time and energy used in the cotton dyeing process. As part of the first phase of Color
on Demand, we optimized the use of ECOFASTTM Pure—a pre-treatment solution for cotton garments, developed by Dow. When used with existing dyeing equipment,
ECOFAST™ Pure enables the use of up to 40 percent less water, 85 percent fewer chemicals, 90 percent less energy and a 60 percent reduction in carbon footprint
compared to traditional cotton dyeing processes. In partnership with Dow, we are releasing a detailed manual about ECOFAST™ Pure to encourage industry adoption and
help standardize more sustainable cotton dyeing. By 2025, we aim to use the Color on Demand platform in more than 80 percent of our solid cotton products.

Please explain the rationale for selecting this group of customers and scope of engagement
In March 2021, we announced a comprehensive circularity strategy to further advance our sustainability goals, especially our target to reduce carbon emissions throughout
our value chain. One pillar of our circularity strategy is to create circular consumer experiences. As we advance our strategy, we are inviting our customers to learn more
about steps we are taking now and in the future to reduce the climate impact of our products and operations. In March 2021, we launched our consumer-facing Design the
Change website as part of our global e-commerce website. This site allows customers to explore Ralph Lauren’s sustainability commitments, including our greenhouse gas
reduction and renewable energy targets, and highlights products using lower-impact materials and circular design and business models. This campaign is designed to reach
all of our customers through our global e-commerce site and engage all customers who are interested in learning more about what the company is doing to address climate
change.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
The impact of this engagement will be measured based on customer traffic to the Design the Change site. As we implement our climate strategy and expand circular
consumer experiences, we will measure activity and engagement to understand customer knowledge of our climate change performance and strategy. We will use data on
the traffic and engagement on our Design the Change site to identify further opportunities for communicating our climate change response and strategy as well as directing
customers to lower-impact consumer experiences. For example, we could use engagement with customers through this initiative to improve and expand low-carbon
products and services such as products utilizing recycled materials, and to improve customer awareness of these products and services.
C12.1d
(C12.1d) Give details of your climate-related engagement strategy with other partners in the value chain.
We regularly engage with our peers and other organizations through collaborative projects and programs to leverage collective action to address climate change impacts in
our value chain. In particular, we have focused on collaborative initiatives to reduce emissions from our raw materials sourcing, manufacturing, and processing, and
transportation and distribution, as these comprise the largest sources of emissions in our value chain. This year, we were actively involved in a number of initiatives driving
collective action to address climate change impacts in our value chain, including the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, Apparel Impact Institute, UN Fashion Industry Charter for
Climate Action, and the G7 Fashion Pact. Through engagement with these initiatives, we have come to better understand that our actions alone are not enough to address
climate-related strategies throughout our value chain. For example, as signatories to the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, we have committed to establishing a
decarbonization pathway and continuously pursue energy efficiency measures and renewable energy in our value chain. The challenge we face, along with our fellow
Fashion Pact signatories, is finding efficient and effective methods for decarbonization in our supply chain, including with suppliers where we are one of several customers.
Building off the Fashion Charter’s guidance for supply chain decarbonization, we analyzed our GHG emissions and climate risks within our supply chain and established a
roadmap to drive significant GHG reductions in our manufacturing. It has become clear that in order to deliver on our ambitious roadmap, we need to work closely with our
suppliers to align their climate agenda, focus, and priorities with ours. As a result of this analysis and engagement with the Fashion Charter and the Apparel Impact Institute,
we are drawing on guidance and programs from these partners to support our suppliers in establishing an energy and carbon reduction strategy and roadmap. We expect that
these suppliers’ strategies will be crucial in ensuring we achieve our target of a 30% reduction in absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by 2030 compared to a FY20
baseline. We are therefore expanding our collaboration with suppliers through collective action programs that accelerate the standardized approach to setting carbon targets
and low-carbon action plans at the factory level and help them build capability to implement them. We believe this will further empower our supply partners to establish and
implement climate strategies aligned with our climate objectives.

As part of the We Are Still In initiative, Ralph Lauren signed an open letter to the
incoming U.S. Biden-Harris presidential administration along with hundreds of other
U.S. communities, businesses, and institutions. The letter speaks to high-level climate
actions that the incoming administration can take, including and beyond re-entry into
the Paris Climate Agreement, and makes calls for enhanced partnership and
leadership across federal and non-federal entities. It places an emphasis on job
creation, economic recovery, and just and equitable outcomes.
We support the specific policy actions in the letter, including: (1) rejoin the Paris Agreement on day
one, leverage diplomatic partnerships to finance and encourage ambition, and re-engage with the
rest of the world on a global solution to the climate crisis; (2) put forward an ambitious and
equitable nationally determined contribution to the Paris Agreement, with a science-based target for
2030 that takes community and institutional efforts and perspectives into consideration; and (3)
commit the United States to a trajectory of net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner, and implement
policies that put us on a path to achieving that goal.

Is your position on climate change consistent with theirs?
Consistent
Please explain the trade association’s position
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation has been focused since its founding in 2010 on working with businesses, government, and academia to accelerate the transition to a
circular economy. The Make Fashion Circular initiative brings together leaders from across the fashion industry, including brands, cities, philanthropists, NGOs, and
innovators. Its aim is to stimulate the level of collaboration and innovation necessary to create a new textiles economy, aligned with the principles of the circular economy.
The circular economy envisioned by the initiative tackles the root causes of global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution, while creating
opportunities for better growth. It is underpinned by three principles, all led by design: eliminate waste and pollution, keep products and materials in use, and regenerate
natural systems.
