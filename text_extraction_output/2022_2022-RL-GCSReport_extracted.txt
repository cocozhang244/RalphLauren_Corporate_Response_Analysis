Introduction & Overview

================================================================================
For more than half a century, we’ve stood for things that last 
— that never go out of style. This core belief in timelessness 
influences everything we create – from our iconic Polo shirt 
to our cashmere sweaters and hand-stitched ties. These 
products and more were created to be worn, loved and 
passed on through generations.
Today, we are applying this philosophy beyond the products 
we make and into the world around us. We are calling this 
next chapter in our Citizenship and Sustainability journey 
— Timeless by Design. It represents our commitment to 
ensure timelessness is embedded from inspiration through to 
products’ every use and reuse across generations — taking 
into account how we value nature, and how we champion the 
people and communities that intersect our business.
This year’s Global Citizenship and Sustainability Report 
captures this ambition and reflects on this past year’s 
progress, including:
•	 Strengthening our commitment to advancing a circular 
economy through our new Live On promise to enable our 
past and future products to live on responsibly by 2030;
Dear Teams, Customers, Community and Business Partners,  
Investors and Friends, 
A Message From Our Chairman and CEO
R A L P H  L A U R E N
PAT R I C E  L O U V E T
Executive Chairman and  
Chief Creative Officer
President and Chief 
Executive Officer
•	 Establishing an internal Design with Intent department 
focused on culturally sustainable design, product 
development and storytelling;
•	 Deepening our work across Native and Indigenous 
communities, including the launch of our Artists in 
Residence program;
•	 Expanding our portrayal of the American dream through 
our HBCU collaboration Polo Ralph Lauren Exclusively 
for Morehouse and Spelman Colleges Collection; 
•	 Introducing the RLX CLARUS® Polo Shirt, made with the 
world’s first high-performance cotton fabric comprised 
of 50% recycled cotton; and 
•	 Creating the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund with the Soil 
Health Institute to expand climate-smart agriculture on 
American cotton farms. 
Our commitments and this progress reflect the incredible 
passion of our teams and represent a strong foundation 
on which we will continue to build. Our Timeless by 
Design philosophy was embodied in the very first tie created 
more than 55 years ago, and today, it extends wider and 
deeper into the precious world and communities around us.

Our Global Citizenship
& Sustainability Approach 
“I discovered the heritage of a timeless world, 
uncontrived, free-formed and free-spirited, 
natural and from the earth, and it touched me  
and became the living part of all I design.”
RALPH LAUREN
For more than 50 years, we’ve stood for values and things 
that last — things that are timeless and enduring, things to 
cherish as they age and that never fall out of style. 
This belief remains central to who we are today. It is with 
this core belief that we have reimagined our pursuit of a 
more equitable and sustainable future. We are taking what 
it means to create timeless style and creating a business 
and products that are not only enduring but can inspire the 
dream of a better life with a plan for a better future.
We call this evolution Timeless by Design.
With Timeless by Design, we are taking our philosophy 
of creating products that are meant to be passed down 
through generations and applying it to everything that 
we do — from how we make our products, to how we 
impact the Earth and how we champion our people and 
our communities. 
Our Timeless by Design approach is supported by three 
pillars: Create with Intent, Protect the Environment and 
Champion Better Lives.

C R E AT E  W I T H  I N T E N T
We’ve always created products that are meant to be 
loved and passed down from generation to generation. 
Now, we are making those pieces more responsibly: with 
more sustainable materials, according to circular design 
principles and by instilling cultural sustainability practices. 
By designing timelessness in from the start, we’ll enable all 
our products to live on responsibly.
P R O T E C T  T H E  E N V I R O N M E N T
Creating timeless products goes beyond their design. 
We strive to operate our business in ways that respect 
our planet, such as using renewable energy, managing 
our waste properly and using our water responsibly. By 
adopting practices that help preserve the world’s natural 
sources, we can be stewards in protecting our environment 
for generations to come. 
C H A M P I O N  B E T T E R  L I V E S
Creating a business that is timeless and has a positive 
impact on tomorrow means building relationships that 
stand the test of time — ensuring everyone is included, 
respected and empowered. That’s why we’re committed 
to working with and supporting our employees, partners 
and communities to build a brighter future.

Global Citizenship & Sustainability is integrated across all  
levels of our organization and governed by our Board of Directors.
Governance
Our Board of Directors (the Board) is responsible for formal 
governance of Global Citizenship & Sustainability (GC&S). 
The Board receives progress updates at least once a year 
and reviews our annual GC&S Report. 
Various Board committees have additional responsibilities:
•	 The Nominating, Governance, Citizenship & Sustainability 
Committee oversees our environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) risks and opportunities. The committee 
receives quarterly updates; reviews initiatives, goals and 
policies; and makes recommendations to the Board on 
ESG matters. Each quarterly update includes a detailed 
analysis on a specific ESG topic.
•	 The Finance Committee and the Nominating, Governance, 
Citizenship & Sustainability Committee advise on the 
incorporation of goals into our corporate strategy 
and engagement of business initiatives that influence 
corporate citizenship and sustainability.
•	 The Audit Committee assesses ESG risks as part of  
its overall Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) review.
•	 The Talent, Culture and Total Rewards Committee 
considers performance against Company ESG key 
performance indicators in their compensation decisions.
Our Global Citizenship & Sustainability Steering Committee 
includes senior leaders from across our Company and 
meets regularly to prioritize our approach and allocate 
resources. Committee members also define, track and 
champion our citizenship and sustainability work, including 
diversity, equity and inclusion across the organization.
In April 2022, we expanded the responsibility and 
accountability of our Chief Communications Officer into 
the new role of Chief Impact & Communications Officer. 
This position was created in recognition of the evolving 
role business plays at the intersection of ESG strategy, 
policy, communication and action.

M AT E R I A L I T Y 
As part of regular business operations, we complete 
an updated materiality assessment every two to three 
years to refine our understanding of key priority issues 
based on sustainability risks, opportunities and impacts. 
We aim to align these with stakeholder expectations for 
how we react to impacts of issues on business success, 
as well as the impacts of the business on the economy, 
environment and people.
We worked with Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), 
a third-party consulting company, to complete the 
assessment using their Double Materiality methodology  
in 2022.
BSR engaged internal and external stakeholders through 
interviews, focus groups and surveys to analyze our 
Company’s impact on society and the environment, along 
with our enterprise value. Among the external stakeholders 
were environmental and social NGOs, supplier and licensee 
partners and global retailers. Internal stakeholders 
included employees across all functions, all geographies 
and levels of the organization. 
As this latest assessment was completed in May 2022, 
the FY22 report will primarily use our prior materiality 
assessment as a basis for reporting. We found that similar 
issues to our last assessment remained material along with 
an increased focus on: 
•	 Business Ethics
•	 Climate Change
•	 Diversity, Inclusion & Fair Treatment
•	 Human Rights Due Diligence
•	 Raw Material Sustainability
•	 Traceability of Raw Materials
•	 Waste
•	 Water Stewardship
The ranking of issues seen below will influence and drive 
our future GC&S strategy.

2030 GOAL
2025 GOALS
leading circular economy network — bringing together 
businesses, innovators, cities, universities and thought 
leaders to build a circular economy and scale solutions 
globally. EMF and its fashion industry partners work to drive 
momentum toward its Make Fashion Circular vision where 
clothes are used more, made to be made again and crafted 
from safe and recycled or renewable materials. As part of 
this, Ralph Lauren will capture circularity progress across 
our operations using Circulytics, a company-level measuring 
tool developed by EMF. We also joined a coalition of 100 
brands, mills and manufacturers in EMF’s Jeans Redesign 
Project, to contribute to a blueprint for scaling denim 
production based on the principles of a circular economy. 
Additionally, we are committed to designing new products 
according to circular principles, and extending the life 
of current apparel by piloting ways to rent, repair and 
recirculate. Investing in circular innovation across the 
industry is also integral to our mission.
Anchored in this commitment and our long-standing vision 
of timeless style, our circularity strategy is helping to shape 
our approach to product development and to supporting a 
more circular textile economy. 
We continue to explore partnerships with credible experts 
within the industry. In 2021, Ralph Lauren joined the Ellen 
MacArthur Foundation (EMF) as a Network Partner and 
member of the Fashion Advisory Board. EMF is the world’s

We’re focused on applying the principles of Cradle to 
Cradle® (C2C) as foundational inspiration for all aspects 
of design, development, manufacturing, packaging and 
the post-sale experience. Ralph Lauren has been working 
closely with the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation 
Institute to support the adoption of the latest version 
of the C2C® standard and to provide apparel brand 
perspective on its use.
In FY22, we began working on our first C2C-Certified® 
product, a luxury cashmere sweater, which will be  
in-market late 2022. Later this year, we will be kicking 
off two additional C2C product certification projects and

GOALS
By 2025, five of our iconic 
products will be C2C-Certified®.
By 2025, we will offer high 
quality products made with 
100% recycled cotton.
We will set and implement 
circular principles into our 
design and development 
process by 2025.
By 2025, we will connect 
consumers with options to

practices to advance the 
circular economy.
OUR  
COMMIT-
MENT
We will pursue Cradle to 
Cradle® certification for 
additional products, leverage 
innovative technologies to 
further our development of 
high-quality, 100% recycled 
cotton products and work 
cross-functionally to develop a 
set of circular design principles 
tailored to Ralph Lauren.
We will establish both physical 
and digital platforms that 
connect consumers to 
services that help extend 
the life of their Ralph Lauren 
products. These include 
opportunities to sell and buy 
preloved items, rent iconic 
pieces and locate resources 
for recycling maintenance  
and repair
We will deepen our investment 
in innovative technologies 
and regenerative practices 
to accelerate the production 
of high-quality, nature-based 
raw materials and products.
The Three Pillars of Our Circularity Strategy
begin leveraging circular principals to influence additional 
design and development. We will begin applying circularity 
to our broader design and development approach through 
the development of Ralph Lauren specific circularity 
principles. These will be developed with our design and 
development teams and in collaboration with sustainability 
and circularity experts. By 2030, our new products will 
be designed, developed, manufactured and packaged in 
alignment with these principles.

Ralph Lauren has committed to extend the life of its 
products by 2025 by providing consumers ways to rent, 
repair and recirculate our products. 
Rental continues to be one of the pillars of our circular 
strategy. This year, we are broadening The Lauren Look, 
our first subscription apparel rental platform, beyond 
the Lauren Ralph Lauren brand, to include our women’s 
Polo Ralph Lauren brand. In addition to introducing rental 
programs to consumers, we are donating products that are 
no longer in circulation to Delivering Good, a nonprofit that 
gives manufacturers and retailers an efficient way to share 
excess inventory across their network of nonprofits to help 
those stricken by poverty, or to provide disaster relief to 
communities in need across the United States.
We will offer more circular services for consumers as 
we continue to enable the recirculation of Ralph Lauren 
product through our various digital and brick and mortar 
distribution channels. We will also continue to lean into 
upcycling Ralph Lauren products. 
Our Digital Product ID (DPIDs) system provides a 
scannable QR code on product labels that enable 
consumers to authenticate garments, affirming the value 
of products in resale markets. This digital data platform 
will be further leveraged to support other recirculation 
opportunities such as recycling and repair.
A D VA N C E  A  C I R C U L A R  
P R O D U C T  E C O N O M Y 
We believe Ralph Lauren has a unique and important 
role to play in supporting the advancement of a more 
circular apparel economy. We will continue to invest 
in collaborative and innovative partners to help scale 
technology and materials solutions. Specific investments, 
such as our significant support of Natural Fiber Welding 
Inc., help to increase the availability of high-quality inputs 
and significantly reduce dependence on the extraction of 
virgin materials.

Introduction & Overview

[PAGE 14 OF 96]
================================================================================
Our focus on quality and authenticity drives us to look for 
sustainable raw materials through the lenses of durability, 
craftsmanship and performance. Our sustainable material 
strategy is driven by our ethos of creating more positive 
environmental and social outcomes through the sourcing 
decisions we make. 
We recognize the importance of supporting fiber production 
that contributes to ecosystem functioning and soil health 
to support a sustainable and profitable fiber industry. A key 
aspect of our sustainable materials strategy is to pioneer, 
foster and scale impact through industry partnerships 
like the Fashion Pact, UNFCCC’s Raw Materials Working 
Group and Textile Exchange, as well as make long-term 
commitments that advance our goals. This includes an 
investment in Leather Impact Partnership Incentives through 
Textile Exchange’s Leather Impact Accelerator and  
Sustainable Materials
We commit to using more materials in a way that results in positive 
social and environmental impact, protects biodiversity, advances 
animal welfare and continuously improves the traceability of our 
raw materials.
•	 Achieve 100% sustainably sourced  
key materials
•	 100% of animal-derived materials will be 
certified to an animal welfare standard  
and traceable 
•	 Achieve 100% wood substrates used in 
key elements of new store interiors Forest 
Stewardship Council (or equivalent) 
Certified repurposed or recycled by 2025
2025 GOALS
The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation’s founding 
contribution to the Soil Health Institute to create the 
U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund (USRCF).
In FY22, we continued to increase transparency 
and traceability of our material use by:
•	  Continuing to map our supply chain to enable 
material origin visibility across each step of the 
textile and garment supply chain to inform a 
robust sourcing strategy, provide assurance of 
sustainability impacts and mitigate risk. We are 
piloting technologies to digitally trace U.S.-grown 
cotton as well as certified fibers in our supply chain. 
In addition, we are using FIBRETRACE®, a technology 
which relies on luminescent pigments within the 
fiber to enable physical traceability, piloting on 
transitional cotton sourced from India. 
•	 	Continuing to work towards developing systems to 
measure the total volume (by weight) of materials 
used in our product, which will enable us to 
systematically track our usage more accurately 
and thus analyze the sustainable attributes and 
the impact of our material usage.
In January, we launched our Global R&D Studio 
(Fabrics and Leathers) as a physical and virtual 
resource built on the principle that all materials must 
have sustainable attributes. The Studio is a central 
resource hub for material and processes criteria, 
guidelines and developments, including our raw 
material sustainability dashboard. Designers are 
able to leverage this resource to source vetted and  
secured materials.

KEY MATERIAL GOALS 
D I G I TA L  P R O D U C T  I D E N T I F I C AT I O N
In 2019, we launched a digital product identification 
program to link our physical product with the digital 
world in order to power product authentication, further 
digitize our supply chain operations, deliver an enhanced 
consumer experience and enable a platform upon which 
to build future services and experiences.
Our DPIDs are hosted on an agile platform so that we can 
continue to add and scale new features and capabilities, 
such as facilitating the reuse, resale and recycling of our 
products to enable a more circular life cycle. The overall 
goal is to reduce the environmental impact of labeling 
while improving consumer information access and enabling 
continuous cycling of textile resources. 
To date, we’ve incorporated more than 200 factories into 
the DPID program, and as a result, a majority of our apparel 
products now have digital IDs, and we expect every product 
to have a digital ID by 2024. 
77%
of our units produced met at least one 
of our sustainable material criteria in 
FY22 — up from 33% in FY21.

In FY22, we enjoyed success through two separate 
endeavors in the world of sport. First, our partnership 
with Natural Fiber Welding was on display at the 2022 
Australian Open with the launch of the RLX CLARUS®  
Polo Shirt. It marked the unveiling of a first-to-market 
patented platform that transforms virgin and recycled 
cotton in ways previously not possible. The shirt featured a 
high-performance cotton that performs similarly to plastic-
based synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon, but 
without the use of petroleum-based fossil fuels. The shirt 
will be available to consumers worldwide in summer 2022. 
Second, we continued our partnership with the U.S. 
Olympic and Paralympic teams as their official Opening 
and Closing Ceremonies outfitter. These winter collections 
featured a range of sustainable materials and traceable 
production practices, including the use of recycled 
polyester, nylon and down along with Responsible Wool 
Standard (RWS)-certified, U.S.-grown wool. We were proud 
to dress the more than 1,000 members of Team USA who 
competed in Beijing. 
We’re ramping up our cross-industry 
collaborative efforts alongside the refinement 
of our own goals. One example is our continued 
work with the Fashion Pact and Textile 
Exchange to solidify our biodiversity strategy. 
We are participating in working groups that are 
developing ways to address biodiversity issues 
in the leather and cashmere supply chains. 
This work will leverage the insights provided 
by the Biodiversity Insights Report, published 
by Textile Exchange in November 2021. This 
report provides the first tool for the apparel 
and textile industry to benchmark the sector’s 
impacts on biodiversity.
More holistically, we are evaluating how our 
existing climate, water and materials initiatives 
intersect with the protection and conservation 
of the natural world and where we have further 
opportunities. Our work today — from our 
materials goals to our climate commitments — 
provides a strong foundation for our biodiversity 
strategy, and we will build upon this foundation 
as we set further commitments to establish 
Science-Cased Targets for Nature.

In the U.S., The U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund (USRCF) 
works with growers to support adoption of soil health 
management systems, including practices such as cover 
crops and reduced tillage, across more than 1 million acres 
of U.S. cotton cropland.
The USRCF is led by the Soil Health Institute (SHI), a 
nonprofit with a mission to safeguard and enhance the 
vitality and productivity of soil through scientific research 
and advancement. The USRCF is a first-of-its-kind, farmer-
focused and science-based effort to support long-term, 
sustainable cotton production in the U.S. The USRCF brings 
together a diverse group of farmers, advisors, landowners, 
conservationists, soil scientists, educators, business 
leaders, philanthropists and others who share a common 
belief that together we can create a long-term sustainable 
cotton industry in the U.S. The founding investment from 
The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation enables SHI to 
accelerate and scale these efforts to reach farmers in a 
way they haven’t before.

of our defined sustainability attributes.
This year we continued our transition to sustainable cotton 
for apparel products, including polo shirts, knits and shirts, 
Ralph Lauren Home transitioned 95% of core bedding 
and bath and new fashion bedding to cotton qualities we 
recognize as sustainable, such as organic or Better Cotton. 
In 2021, we sourced more than 19,000 metric tons of cotton 
lint as Better Cotton, while supporting the not-for-profit’s 
holistic efforts to make cotton a more climate-resilient, 
socially-viable and, ultimately, more sustainable crop. 
Supporting the increased supply of sustainably grown 
cotton on a global scale is imperative in order to meet 
our 2025 goal of using 100% sustainably sourced cotton.

Further, we plan to join the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol 
in FY23. The Trust Protocol is a voluntary organization 
for U.S. cotton producers whose goal is to provide a 
comprehensive program of verification against Trust 
Protocol benchmarks. The Trust Protocol cotton is 
measured and analyzed at the field level to help farmers 
demonstrate their environmental credentials. This offers 
brands such as Ralph Lauren a unique set of assurances to 
measure sustainability commitments and to work towards 
tracing U.S. cotton through the supply chain.
Organic cotton fiber currently makes up less than 1% of 
cotton grown annually. There are significant barriers for 
farmers who want to switch from conventional to certified 
organic farming, including financial challenges and a 
two- to three-year transitional period before achieving 
certification. Directly supporting farmers during this 
transition provides an opportunity for brands like Ralph 
Lauren to help increase the quantity of organic cotton 
available on the market. In Spring 2023, with the help of 
The Sourcery and our mill and factory partners, we will 
introduce products made with transitional or in-conversion 
cotton from farmers in India.
P O LY E S T E R ,  N Y L O N  A N D  V I S C O S E
We are continuing our efforts to phase out virgin sources 
of polyester and nylon and switch to recycled options or 
natural fibers. Currently, polyester accounts for 6.6% of 
our total material use. 
In 2021, we: 
•	 Used almost six million pounds of recycled polyester — 
the equivalent of 52 million recycled plastic bottles and 
representative of 41% of our total polyester use (an 18% 
increase from FY21)
•	 Converted eight major programs across men’s, women’s 
and children’s Polo outerwear to recycled polyester
Our material teams continue to work with our suppliers to 
increase the percent of our viscose coming from viscose 
manufacturers with a “green shirt” rating on  
The CanopyStyle Audit. Through supplier surveys and 
other efforts, we achieved our bridge goal of sourcing 50% 
of our viscose from low-risk manufacturers in FY22.
Animal-Derived Materials
Around 4% of our total material use comes from animal-
derived sources. We are committed to the well-being and 
respectful treatment of animals, as described in our Animal 
Welfare Policy, which includes our approach to sourcing 
exotic skins and our long-standing ban on the use of fur. 
In FY22, we continued increasing our uptake of sustainable 
materials and our focus on traceability.
L E AT H E R
In 2021, 64% of our leather tanneries were certified by the 
Leather Working Group (LWG).
Over the past year we elevated our support of sustainable 
leather in multiple ways. Ralph Lauren was a pioneer brand 
in Textile Exchange’s Impact Partnership Incentives for the 
Leather Impact Accelerator, investing directly in support 
of Brazilian cattle farms to be verified as Deforestation/
Conversion-Free (DCF) and to achieve animal welfare 
certification in the next three years. We also joined LWG’s 
Traceability Task Force and deforestation working groups 
to help guide further improvements in the leather trade. 
Lastly, we are participating in the steering committee for 
the development and finalization of the Responsible Reptile 
Sourcing Standard (RRSS) as part of the Southeast Asian 
Reptile Conservation Alliance (SARCA).

NFW MIRUM
MIRUM® is a revolutionary alternative material 
made from renewable resources that include plant-
based materials and agricultural byproducts while 
also being free of synthetic plastics. We developed 
the MIRUM® Olympic Patch in partnership with 
Natural Fiber Welding Inc, and added it to Team 
USA’s parade apparel at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics 
as an initial test of the material’s potential. We 
are currently sampling the material further to 
determine its best consumer utilization with an 
intention to launch the product in 2023.
D O W N
We use 100% Responsible Down Standard-certified virgin 
down or recycled down across our product offerings. 
We also continue to leverage Primaloft’s® ThermoPlumeTM 
down alternative, where applicable. 
Products using recycled down will be introduced in our 
stores in Fall 2022.   
W O O L
We continue to prioritize working with Responsible 
Wool Standard (RWS)-certified suppliers. We’re exploring 
additional opportunities for our wool strategy in FY23, 
such as partnering with growers who are using regenerative 
practices and other certification options.
C A S H M E R E
Our cashmere strategy focuses on sourcing preferred 
fibers such as Sustainable Fibre Alliance-certified 
cashmere that address animal welfare and land 
management risks, and recycled cashmere, which 
minimizes waste and has a smaller environmental 
impact compared to virgin material. In FY22, we used 
3,691 pounds of recycled cashmere in sweater programs. 
In FY23, we plan to engage in project-based initiatives in 
cashmere-growing regions to support systemic change 
and grassland restoration.

Sustainable Store Interiors
We are committed to designing and building Ralph Lauren 
stores with materials that minimize environmental impact 
and maximize occupant health. 
In FY22, we continued formalizing our approach to creating 
more sustainable spaces in our stores. Our goal is to 
ensure all the key elements in our new store interiors — 
including fixtures, displays, flooring, hangers and signage 
— are sustainably-sourced and made from materials 
that minimize environmental impact and maximize  
occupant health.  
We base our approach on guidelines from leading green 
building and sourcing organizations, including the 
U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and the Forest 
Stewardship Council (or equivalent). 
HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR  
PROGRESS INCLUDE:
82%
 of wood hangers produced for RL retail stores, 
shop-in-shops and outlets in FY22 were made 
from FSC-certified (or equivalent) woods.
100% 
of Children's and Lauren millwork fixtures  
and wall units produced for North America  
shop-in-shops in FY22 were made from  
FSC-certified (or equivalent) woods.
43% 
of shop-in-shops installed in Europe in FY22 
used only millwork fixtures and wall units 
produced from FSC-certified (or equivalent), 
repurposed or recycled woods.
100% 
of wood floors installed in new Polo boutique 
retail stores and Polo outlet stores in  
Europe in FY22 were made from  
FSC-certified (or equivalent) materials.
Consistent with our Forest Protection Policy, we set 
a 2025 goal for 100% of the wood substrates (solids, 
veneers and composites) used in key elements of new 
store interiors to be FSC-certified (or equivalent), 
repurposed or recycled. In 2021, we began tracking the 
percentage of key wood suppliers for store design and 
construction that meet this standard and confirmed 
10 met the benchmark by the end of fiscal year 2022, 
which represents 11% of our suppliers.

Responsible Design
In addition to adopting circular principles, we commit to 
embedding environmental and cultural sustainability, inclusivity 
and celebration into the products we design and stories we tell.
Ensure all of our design, production and 
merchant teams will receive annual training on 
sustainable, circular, inclusive and culturally 
aware design
ONGOING GOAL
to elevate this workstream of passionate individuals 
throughout our organization to a functional department 
of the same name. Now deeply embedded within our 
Company’s organizational design, our Design with Intent 
department is being resourced with expert insight into 
culturally cognizant design and product development to 
think holistically about the stories we champion through 
product creation and storytelling. 
As one of its first efforts, Design with Intent is piloting an 
Artists in Residence program, inviting artisans working with 
a variety of skillsets, mediums and materials to collaborate 
with Ralph Lauren’s design teams. This is intended to be a 
mutually beneficial exchange of resources, talent and trade 
techniques. During their tenure, we expect each Artist 
in Residence to have the opportunity to create a special 
product collaboration, melding the brilliance and unique 
skill of the artisan with our core brand sensibilities.
Our Cultural Awareness Guidelines also support our design 
approach. We update these annually, working with advisors 
and thought leaders within this space, and distribute them 
to all enterprise teams with a role in design, advertising and 
marketing. We support our teams to apply the guidelines in 
practice with our cultural awareness educational program, 
which is mandatory as part of our new hire onboarding 
process for all creative, design, marketing and advertising 
functions. Existing teams receive annual training and 
special workshops to stay current.
Our Approach to Design
Since our founding, Ralph Lauren’s design ethos has 
been inspired by the many beautiful, complex and 
interconnected pieces that make up the fabric of 
America: its history, arts, crafts, cultures and ­— most 
of all — its vibrant people. The breadth and reach of 
our brands across generations and cultures creates a 
style that is authentic, timeless and truly personal. We 
take our responsibility seriously to use the inspiration 
that captivates our imagination in a way that is culturally 
aware and appropriate. We challenge ourselves to think 
differently and expansively about each stage of the design 
and development process. 
In 2020, we launched Design with Intent, a workstream 
aiming to identify and pursue opportunities to be 
intentional and impactful in all that Ralph Lauren 
represents — from product inception to marketing and 
every point along the customer journey, including store 
design and e-commerce. In early 2022, we took the step

Native American & Indigenous 
Community Engagement 
For 55 years, our brand has been a window for the 
world into American life and values. This is an immense 
responsibility, one that is deeply ingrained in our Purpose. 
We have drawn design and storytelling inspiration from 
the beautiful lands and individuals around us, and as we 
continue to evolve and grow, we believe it is important to 
more closely partner with the communities that inspire 
us. We recognize that we must honor the Native and 
Indigenous communities that so richly contribute to the 
culture of this country and many others. 
As we continue to expand our understanding and 
awareness, we are reviewing our internal creative 
processes — focused on forging and expanding meaningful 
partnerships with community members and artisans and 
pursuing long-term pathways for collaboration. We intend 
to use our platform to amplify Native and Indigenous 
perspectives and create space for holistic and authentic 
storytelling. We seek to establish a credible model of 
cultural sustainability, where Native and Indigenous 
communities play a role in creating culturally relevant 
programming, storytelling and timeless products.
In this work, we are developing Native philanthropic 
and partnership programs under the following pillars: 
community resilience reinforcement, scholarship and 
education support, cancer care and prevention, social 
partnerships, water accessibility and environmental 
preservation and design with intent. 
We approach this journey with humility and, above all, with 
dignity and respect for Native and Indigenous communities 
as our guiding principle. Our current efforts include:
C O M PA N Y
Increase Representation, Recognition and Celebration
•	 Forming an external advisory body, comprised of diverse 
Native voices across industries and creative disciplines 
to help inform our actions.
•	 Launching an internal Employee Resource Group (ERG), 
known as our Native American & Indigenous Advisory 
Council, that will work in partnership with our DE&I and 
Design with Intent departments to advise on our Native 
and Indigenous cultural sustainability work. With this 
effort, we aim to reconnect with current employees 
and strengthen our ERG recruitment efforts for new 
employees who identify as Native American  
or Indigenous. 
•	 Aiming to deepen our talent pipelines and academic 
partnerships — through programs like the Creative 
Futures Collective, Institute of American Indian Arts 
(IAIA) and the American Indian College Fund — intending 
to reduce barriers to entry into the fashion industry and 
providing more opportunities for Native and Indigenous 
talent at various levels of our Company.
•	 Continuing to honor moments in the calendar 
important to Native communities, centering around 
the amplification of Native and Indigenous voices 
and perspectives, including but not limited to Native 
American & Indigenous Heritage Month.
Strengthen Structured Education Practices
•	 Continuing to expand upon our mandatory cultural 
awareness trainings for all design, marketing and 
merchandising teams, specifically examining their 
content through a Native and Indigenous lens.
•	 Continuing to curate and host regular Speaker Series 
for our employees to learn directly from Native leaders, 
artisans, designers, historians, activists and more.

In Honor of Black Collegiate Style 
In March 2022, we were proud to build on our partnership with Morehouse College and Spelman College with a 
limited-edition collection inspired by the schools’ rich heritage and esteemed traditions. The collection seeks to 
honor the history of both colleges and widen the aperture of Ralph Lauren’s storytelling — including the nature 
of life at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), a story previously untold in depictions of Ralph 
Lauren’s collegiate sensibility. 
Conceptualized and designed by Morehouse and Spelman alumni at Ralph Lauren, the collection also marks 
the first time the brand has produced a campaign with an all-Black cast including its photographer, creative 
directors, cinematographer and talent — predominantly comprising students, faculty and alumni at both 
institutions. Our first-of-its-kind film, “A Portrait of the American Dream,” and commemorative yearbook detail 
the founding and historical significance of HBCUs through the lens of these two institutions, demonstrating the 
use of style as an expression of aspiration, a form of self-empowerment and a tool of resistance.
Further, The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation announced a $2 million commitment to support scholarships 
for Black students, including those at Morehouse College and Spelman College. Within this commitment, The 
Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation will also support 10 additional HBCUs through the United Negro College 
Fund (UNCF). 
We also continued scholarship support for academic programs and scholarships supporting underrepresented 
students via the American Indian College Fund, Asian Americans for Equality, Asian & Pacific Islander American 
Scholars, the Asian University for Women in Bangladesh, the Hispanic Scholarship Fund and the Fashion Institute 
of Technology’s Social Justice Center.

feedback on Responsible Purchasing Practices. Based on 
this feedback, internal working groups were established 
to focus on key improvement areas on five purchasing 
practices. Based on FY21 Better Buying Survey results, we 
updated our Responsible Purchasing Practices to support 
more understanding across our entire organization. We 
invited select suppliers to speak at various events across 
the Company to further inform our workforce about 
improvements in our overall efforts.
We also created a mandatory training program for our entire 
Buying/Sourcing/Cross Functional teams and our working 
groups will continue to work with our teams on Responsible 
Purchasing Practices for constant improvements. We expect 
to collect the next round of Better Buying Survey feedback in 
summer 2022.
During Supplier Summits and in one-on-one Supplier 
Engagement meetings, we communicated our expectations 
in Business, Quality Assurance, Global Citizenship & 
Sustainability, and sought feedback on expectations of us as 
a responsible partner. We also discussed how we can grow 
together with all suppliers, focusing on our key and strategic 
suppliers that represent the majority of our business. 
For more on our supplier and worker empowerment efforts, 
please see Rights and Empowerment in the Supply Chain.
Responsible Sourcing
We seek to work with partners who share our values and our 
commitment to conduct business with social and environmental 
integrity at heart.
80% of our business will be with suppliers that 
meet key and strategic supplier criteria with 
potential in business, social and environmental 
performance.
Supplier Engagement
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) aims to achieve 
mutual, long-term, positive impacts across our supply 
chain. This requires enduring partnerships based on 
transparency and trust.
Our SES guides us in building and maintaining these 
partnerships. It enables us to drive continuous 
improvement and positive impact based on shared 
transparency, accountability and value creation. We 
continue to strengthen our framework with frequent 
one-on-one supplier check-ins, semi-annual supplier 
summits and roundtable discussions.
In FY21, we started working with the Better Buying 
Initiative to collect our business partners’ anonymous 
2025 GOAL
Our Responsible Purchasing Practices define how Ralph Lauren conducts business with integrity, 
transparency, respect for universal human and labor rights and environmental sustainability.  
These standards are critical to our work as responsible corporate citizens.

Even with pandemic-related challenges and disruptions, 
we continued to increase our business purchase value in 
FY22, to 53% (a 3% increase from FY21) with our Strategic 
and Key suppliers, aiming for 80% by 2025. We continue 
to make progress despite managing various country and 
factory lockdowns as well as ongoing worker shortages, 
which heavily impact our partners. Together with our 
partners, we took necessary actions to support and 
reallocate certain products between their factories or 
countries to mitigate risk and create supply chain agility.
In FY22, we continued our efforts to empower suppliers 
to maintain and/or improve the performance of our 
product while reducing back and forth communication, 
sampling and reference materials. This important work is 
done through our continued efforts to certify suppliers’ 
internal testing labs for performance attributes of 
product, calibration/certification as it pertains to fit and 
construction approvals and the implementation of digital 
product approvals using 3D capabilities (where applicable). 
We also partnered with our mills via an independent 
third-party provider to digitize color approvals via 
spectrophotometer readings.
In FY22, we expanded the rollout of the Sustainable 
Apparel Coalition’s (SAC) Higg Index Facility Environment 
Module (FEM) to cover our broader supply chain and 
increased visibility of our supply chain’s environmental 
performance data. 
•	 We collected data from 273 Tier 1 facilities, representing 
92% of our supply chain spend — an increase from  
77% last year. 
•	 Within the reporting facilities, 229 (87% of our business 
spend) have completed data verification by an SAC-
approved third party. 
•	 Facilities scored an average of 46 points across all 
sections, with an average of 59 points in the water 
section and 71 in the energy section. 
•	 The expanded FEM rollout also covered 50 mills (up from 
31 facilities last year), representing approximately 54% of 
our woven and knit fabric and sweater yarn production. 
•	 A total of 48 mills (25 facilities in FY21) have completed 
third-party verification, with an average score of 
58 points (49 last year) across all sections.

Our teams continue to assess supplier capabilities, 
capacities and performance, which in turn supports 
workers at the factory level. During FY22, we continued  
our efforts to develop a capacity management tool to 
collect and visualize global capacity, with an upcoming 
rollout plan for our Tier 1 Suppliers. This will help us avoid 
placing orders that might lead suppliers to subcontract 
without our authorization or to place pressure on workers 
to work excessive hours. To avoid making requests of our 
suppliers that could exceed their capacity to supply us 
on time, we plan orders early, keep factory capacity and 
capabilities under review and work to anticipate the need 
for new capabilities.
In FY22, we fully integrated citizenship and sustainability 
into our SES and launched our Vendor Management System 
(VMS) — a database that enables us to share information 
and opportunities with all Tier 1, subcontracted processing 
facilities and Tier 2 suppliers. We also integrated and 
evolved citizenship and sustainability key performance 
indicators into our vendor scorecard, with specific focuses 
on carbon, water and sustainable chemical management 
performance, and social and environmental targets, which 
now sit alongside other business-critical issues, such as 
quality. This allows us to transparently communicate our 
sustainability expectations, evaluate and monitor progress 
of our suppliers and strengthen focus and collaboration 
towards continuous facility-level improvement.
We work to support our suppliers by clearly communicating 
expectations and leveraging forums where we enable 
suppliers to share challenges and learnings to develop a 
common understanding of our requirements. In light of 
pandemic-related travel restrictions in FY22, we continued 
the frequency of online webinars and meetings to engage 
suppliers on key issues. We also organized multiple weekly 
sustainability office hours to stay connected with our 
suppliers and discuss their input and questions related to 
our sustainability initiatives and launches.

Climate
We are committed to playing our part to address the climate 
crisis by reducing greenhouse gas emissions across our 
supply chain to a level consistent with reaching global net 
zero emissions. 
Achieve net zero GHG emissions from a 
FY20 base year
Reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG 
emissions by 30% (SBTi-approved) 
compared to a FY20 base year 
Power our owned and operated offices, 
distribution centers and stores with 
100% renewable electricity
2030 GOAL
2025 GOAL
2040 GOAL
Our Climate Strategy
Our GHG reduction goal was approved by the Science-
Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) in June 2020. This goal 
is in line with GHG reductions required to keep global 
temperature rise to 1.5°C for Scope 1 and 2 and well below 
2°C for Scope 3. We plan to increase the ambition of this 
2030 target alongside our industry to align with a 1.5°C 
scenario across Scope 1, 2, and 3. Beyond meeting our 
2030 emissions reductions goals, we intend to achieve 
net zero GHG emissions by 2040. We plan to seek SBTi 
approval for our new 2030 target and our net zero target 
in calendar year 2022. To accompany these commitments, 
we published a Net Zero Commitment Statement that 
details how we will achieve these targets. 
Achieving and sustaining net zero emissions will require 
adoption of low- and zero-carbon practices throughout 
our supply chain. As we develop and refine our roadmap 
to achieving net zero by 2040, we have identified the 
strategies that will be most important to reach this target. 
These strategies include the electricity used in our 
operations, energy used by our suppliers, how we transport 
our goods, the raw materials in our products and the 
circular products and experiences we offer to customers.

Our industry collaborates to address many of the 
decarbonization challenges we face, including the 
transition to renewable energy across our supply chains 
and enabling a more circular economy. We participate in 
many of these organizations, including RE100, UN Fashion 
Industry Charter for Climate Action, the G7 Fashion Pact, 
Clean Energy Buyers Alliance and the Sustainable Apparel 
Coalition. We have also voiced our support for bold U.S. 
climate policy action to ensure the transition to a low-
carbon world.
To make our Company more resilient to evolving climate-
related risks, we developed a cross-functional Climate Risk 
Task Force. The Task Force meets semiannually to identify 
and describe key climate risks, communicate climate risks 
to key stakeholders — including our leadership team and 
the Board — and ensure key actions are being taken to 
address risks. We align our climate risk disclosures with the 
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosure (TCFD), as summarized in the TCFD 
Index of this report and our annual CDP Climate response.
Continuing trends from last year, the lingering business 
disruptions from COVID-19 are reflected in our overall 
carbon footprint, as our absolute emissions decreased 
by 32% in FY22 from our FY20 baseline. These changes 
are driven by production volumes decreasing by over 
25.6% compared to FY20, which contributes significantly 
to our Scope 3 emissions from manufacturing and raw 
materials. These changes in emissions are also driven by 
regular improvements to our carbon footprint methodology 
consistent with carbon accounting best practices, including 
collecting more complete data from our suppliers and 
updates to our underlying emission factors. We remain 
committed to implementing our GHG action plan for 
achieving our carbon reduction targets.

Our Operations
We’re working to mitigate the operational contributors 
to our carbon footprint. We’re investing in a number 
of renewable energy programs and initiatives to help 
transition to an energy future that’s truly sustainable.
R E N E W A B L E  E N E R G Y  
&  E N E R G Y  E F F I C I E N C Y
Moving to 100% renewable electricity for our owned  
and operated facilities is essential to meeting our  
GHG reduction goals.
In FY22, 6% of electricity used in our operations was from 
renewable sources, such as wind power. This is consistent 
with the share of renewable electricity used in FY21 
and represents renewable energy attribute certificate 
purchases in Europe.
We continued to implement our renewables strategy in 
FY22 focused on virtual power purchase agreements 
(VPPAs) in North America and Europe. We expect to 
sign our first VPPA in FY23. For any remaining renewable 
electricity needs, we will source renewable energy credits 
(RECs) and equivalent certificates. 
We also continued to improve the energy efficiency of our 
stores and offices. We are focused on reducing energy-
intensive components like lighting, heating and cooling 
through energy management systems and the installation 
of more efficient technology. Over the last 12 months, 
we began to deploy new energy management systems at 
our North American retail stores. These systems allow 
us to more accurately track energy use and adjust our 
lighting, heating and cooling for greater efficiency. We also 
completed heating, ventilation and air conditioning system 
upgrades at 19 European stores to provide more efficient 
temperature control.
Also, we are beginning to implement UV protection films 
at our stores to protect our products from excessive sun 
exposure while reducing the need for air conditioning in 
warmer months. We are working to install UV protection 
on windows at all stores in Europe by the end of FY24.

Gas Protocol, the industry standard and international tool for carbon accounting. For a more 
detailed methodology, see our ESG Supplement.

By the end of FY24, all our retail stores in North America 
and Europe will be equipped with efficient lighting. We 
are also initiating a full LED retrofit at our North Carolina 
distribution center campus that is expected to begin 
installation in FY23.
Our Supply Chain 
In FY22, we increased our engagement with our 
manufacturing partners to ensure carbon footprint 
reduction is fully integrated into their strategic roadmap. 
We began to invest in technical support for our partners 
to develop decarbonization strategy, set targets and 
implementation plans that align with the industry’s timeline 
and ambition level. We believe this is a critical step to 
unlock long-term visibility for our partners and further align 
on our mutual climate and business trajectory.
C A R B O N  L E A D E R S H I P  P R O G R A M
In FY22, we continued our partnership with the Apparel 
Impact Institute (aii) to roll out the Carbon Leadership 
Program within our supply chain. We conducted a supply 
chain carbon emission analysis prior to the roll out to 
identify priority facilities to develop a decarbonization 
pathway. Through the Program, we invested in technical 
support for each manufacturing facility to develop their 
bespoke 2025 and 2030 carbon and water reduction 
roadmaps and clear action plan with near-, medium- 
and long-term priorities that align with broader industry 
ambitions and best practices. 
We enrolled 24 fabric mill and vertical facilities (those with 
both material and finished goods production in the same 
location), representing approximately 45% of our raw 
material business spend, and nine strategic finished goods 
facilities into our first cohort of the Program. 
In FY22, the nominated facilities have set carbon reduction 
targets between 14 to 78% by 2030 against their 2019 
baseline. Based on the developed roadmaps for the 
nominated facilities, it is estimated that the aggregate 
annual carbon and water savings at the facility level will 
reach 800,000 tons of CO2 equivalent and 8 million m3 
of water, respectively, by the end of the decade. We will 
continue to expand the rollout of the program in our 
supply chain and work closely with our suppliers to track 
progress and support them in capability building and 
collective action programs that help overcome obstacles in 
implementing their action plan.
100 
stores in North America, Europe and Asia 
were retrofitted for energy-efficient LED 
lighting, as we continued installation  
at new stores in FY22

In FY20, we enrolled five Tier 2 fabric mills in the Aii’s 
Mill/Impact Program to help reduce their overall 
environmental impact, including carbon and energy use. 
In FY22, they completed an 18-month program focusing 
on efficiency and optimization. On average, the facilities 
completed 90% of all recommended measures, including 
46 projects in total with an average investment payback 
period of 7.9 months. Through the completion of these 
optimization projects, our facilities achieved an estimated 
annual total savings of: 
•	 679,637 m3 of water 
•	 80,489 tons of steam
•	 11,299 MWh of electricity
•	 2,467 tons of coal
•	 1,541,666 tons of natural gas
•	 42,692 tons of CO2

Our Scope 3 footprint includes emissions from product 
transport, such as train, ship and air freight. To mitigate 
cost and environmental impact, we prioritize efficiency 
when choosing how to transport products to our 
distribution centers. We only allow vendors to deliver 
products by air in rare circumstances, such as when 
production does not meet delivery deadlines and there  
is a risk to keeping our promise to our customers.

a combination of factors, including efforts not to buy ahead 
and create excess stock and time constraints linked to 
factory closures or ocean shipping and pandemic-related 
port delays. In FY22, vendor-managed air accounted for 
6.3% of total shipments, compared with 2.4% in FY21.
Beginning this year, our logistics provider selection 
process includes a sustainability scorecard that measures 
candidates’ sustainability practices — from the presence 
of a company sustainability strategy to performance 
measurement and continuous improvement plans. 
We are signatories to the Ocean Conservancy’s Arctic 
Corporate Shipping Pledge, committing us to not hire 
carriers to ship our products through Arctic Trans-
Shipment Routes.

Water Stewardship
We commit to reducing water consumption across our value 
chain and to safeguarding and preserving water resources in 
our communities.
WATER STEWARDSHIP  
APPROACH
Achieve at least a 20% reduction in total 
water use across our operations and value 
chain, compared to a FY20 baseline
2025 GOAL
Freshwater is an essential resource for people and wildlife 
and a foundation for healthy ecosystems and thriving 
economies. It’s also a resource that the apparel industry 
is heavily reliant on — from growing cotton to dyeing 
and washing fabric. Our approach to water stewardship 
includes actions that address overall use and quality, and 
protecting watersheds and ensuring access. 
Conservation
In FY22, we continued to collaborate with World Wildlife 
Fund (WWF) to advance our conservation work and set a 
comprehensive strategy for water stewardship and water 
use reductions in our value chain. We are in the process 
of setting contextual water targets to better align our 
reduction goal with localized water challenges. In priority 
water-stressed locations, we are contributing in collective 
action projects and local partnerships to scale water 
use assessments and reduction strategies. Through our 
FY21 water risk analysis, we identified priority basins in 
our supply chain that are in great need for watershed 
conservation, reduced water consumption and improved 
community access to water. In FY22, our footprint was 
11,087,765 m3 — a 23.9 % reduction compared to FY20. 
C O N S E R VAT I O N
Safeguard and preserve water resources

Partnering for Water Conservation in India
In FY22, we joined WWF’s Noyyal-Bhavani Collective Action 
Program to help address industry impacts on freshwater in 
the region in collaboration with WWF-India and two other 
corporate partners. The objective of the collective action 
program is to ensure that by 2030, the Noyyal and Bhavani 
sub-basins are healthy river ecosystems that ensure 
water security for people and nature. We nominated six 
manufacturing facilities in the area to identify opportunities 
to improve their efficiency in energy and water use, which in 
turn will help reduce overall impacts from manufacturing. 
This program aims to address shared basin 
challenges through:
•	 A strong foundation of science-based actions; 
•	 Pilots to help inform policy making in the region, which  
is responsible for 90% of total cotton knitwear exports 
from India; and
•	 Clear key performance indicators which measure 
the impact on the landscape.
Key achievements from the program include:
•	 Completed a cross-section and Aquatic Biodiversity survey, and installed a Water Level Recorder (WLR) in 
Moyar for e-flow assessment, which gives an overview of the flow regime to assess if the e-flow for aquatic 
biodiversity is met. 
•	 Implemented pilots in select wetlands for community-led monitoring, water quality improvement and invasive 
species management by distributing water quality kits to citizen groups. A mutual understanding was reached 
to form a working group in Sulur Lake with local NGOs, industrialists and government officials.
•	 Completed a scoping study for 10 textile units in Tirupur and developed improvement plans for four units.
•	 255 participants attended eight training sessions under two modules — Best Practices on Energy  
and Water Conservation.
•	 Completed River Health Assessments (RHAs) for three seasons in Noyyal and Moyar basins, which will 
facilitate the development of a river health card in the upcoming quarter.

Cotton
As part of our water stewardship strategy, we evaluated 
the impacts of cotton farming. We looked at our key cotton 
growing regions through the WWF Water Risk Filter to 
identify geographies with high risk for water scarcity. We 
also estimated total water use (rainfed and irrigated) in 
cotton agriculture — the volume used is significant and 
our focus is on reducing water use in cotton production 
and increasing effectiveness of water use. A key driver 
of this is the adoption of regenerative farming practices 
that make better use of rainfall and irrigated land. These 
practices increase soil fertility, water holding capacity and 
carbon capture; reduce erosion and pollution runoff; and 
create more resilience against floods and droughts. Read 
more about our work to increase the adoption of more 
sustainable cotton.
Community 
Essential to our overall water stewardship strategy is 
supporting watershed health through conservation 
interventions — including wetland restoration, stakeholder 
engagement and the adoption of preferable land use 
management practices. We will invest in a number of 
water conservation programs in the coming year, and 
further our partnerships with local organizations focused 
on community access and water, sanitation and hygiene 
(WASH) solutions.
In FY22, we submitted our first CDP water response 
(an unscored version of the questionnaire) with plans 
to increase our disclosures to a more extensive, scored 
version in the future.
F U R T H E R  W AT E R  A C C E S S  E F F O R T S
Worldwide, one in three people do not have access to 
safe drinking water. To help end this disparity, we support 
organizations providing clean water sources for those in 
need. Through our continued partnership with GiveMeTap, 
we helped fund 18 incremental drinking water projects in 
rural Africa in FY22. We also donate at least $2 for every 
Polo-branded bottle sold on RalphLauren.com to help 
fund the installation of water pumps across rural Ghana. 
By FY2023 the program is expected to provide 36 water 
pumps in the Upper West region of Ghana benefiting more 
than 36,000 people. 
The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation has made 
several additional commitments to improve access to 
clean water and general water functions around the world.

We are supporting our suppliers to improve their water 
reduction targets through the Carbon Leadership 
Program. In FY22, nominated facilities set water 
reduction targets ranging up to 72% by 2030 
against their 2019 baseline. 
Other water stewardship initiatives in FY22 included:
•	 Continued our direct collaboration with manufacturers 
in improving water use efficiency. Since FY20, we 
have been working closely with our suppliers to adopt 
more water-efficient processing for our materials and 
product manufacturing. These transitions have helped 
our suppliers avoid an estimated 169,992 cubic meters 
of water use in FY22.
•	 Launched an open-source ECOFAST manual in 
collaboration with Dow to support faster adoption of an 
improved dyeing process. This effort aims to help the 
industry integrate new methods to reduce the amount 
of water, chemicals and energy needed to color cotton. 
•	 Continued to reduce the use of water-intensive chemicals 
and processing in the production of our core Polo and 
Lauren denim products. For more information, see 
Chemical Management.

Waste Management
We commit to integrating zero-waste principles across 
our business, focusing on reducing waste at its source and 
diverting waste from landfill through increased recycling, 
reuse and other methods. As we work to become a more 
circular business, we’re aiming to reduce excess inventory, 
keep materials in use for as long as possible and minimize 
waste generated at our facilities.
Achieve zero waste to landfill across 
our distribution centers1
Achieve 100% recyclable, reusable or 
sustainably sourced packaging materials
2025 GOAL
2023 GOAL
1 Using the Zero Waste International Alliance definition of zero waste, we will divert more 
than 90% of the waste generated at our distribution centers from landfill and incineration.
Waste in Our Operations
Across our distribution centers, offices and stores, we work to 
minimize waste and avoid sending materials to incineration or 
landfill, including excess inventory. In FY22, overall operational 
waste volumes returned to FY20 levels in line with the increase 
in business activities. We generated approximately 5,767 metric 
tons of waste at our distribution centers and diverted 88% 
of this from landfill — on track to meet our 2023 goal. In our 
North America-owned distribution centers, we achieved a 92% 
diversion rate in FY22. We also collected detailed waste data  
for all of our third-party operated distribution centers in Europe 
and Asia.
D I S T R I B U T I O N  C E N T E R S
In FY22, we worked with local recycling vendors to divert over 
17,000 pounds of hangers from landfill at our North Carolina 
distribution center. In FY22, we conducted a waste audit of 
our North Carolina distribution center, identifying several 
operational improvements to increase waste diversion. As 
a result of one of these recommendations, in FY23, we plan 
to acquire plastic film balers to allow efficient collection and 
recycling for a greater share of the plastic waste generated 
at our facilities.

We are reducing the number of samples being created and 
shipped by working with suppliers to test their materials 
in-house, rather than sending samples to third parties. 
We are also increasing the use of digitization so suppliers 
can create new products virtually, reducing sampling 
components, color approvals and related transportation. 
We continued our partnership with FABSCRAP to recycle 
fabric trim and samples in our offices. Since initiating in 
2020, we’ve recycled over 21,000 pounds of fabric waste 
and reused more than 7,500 pounds of fabric. 
Our sustainability employee resource group, Green 
Ponies, continued to play an active role in other office 
waste reduction efforts. In FY22, the New York-area Green 
Ponies team identified a local business, aNYbag, that 
collects and upcycles flexible plastic into tote bags. To 
address the limited options for plastic film recycling, they 
brought plastic waste from offices and retail stores. Green 
Ponies are currently exploring options for expanding this 
partnership in FY23.
We are also exploring organic waste diversion for 
composting at our global headquarters in partnership 
with our building landlord. 
Managing Excess Inventory
The immense amount of textile waste created annually 
throughout the fashion industry is a systemic problem, 
and one we’re determined to help eliminate. Our Excess 
Inventory Management Principles standardize the steps  
we take to prevent our products from becoming waste.  
The principles are supported by a waste management 
hierarchy to guide our decision-making for inventory 
and commercial waste. 
P R E V E N T I N G  E X C E S S  AT  T H E  S O U R C E
Our first step to reducing inventory waste is to prevent the 
production of excess products. Minimizing overproduction 
is a challenge across our industry. A key part of the solution 
is predicting product demand so we produce only what we 
need. We are working toward this by shortening product 
lead times and implementing agile production models. We 
are also applying intelligent buying techniques that better 
predict demand and match it with manufacturing.
In FY22, we expanded a pilot project to minimize 
overproduction of wholesale orders in multiple markets. 
Using supply and demand balancing, we ensured wholesale 
orders occur only after confirmation of customer orders. 
By refining our sales models, we reduced production by 
approximately 267,000 units to avoid excess production.

Once we have offered our products at full price across 
our range of channels and regions, we consider alternative 
sales channels for unsold products within planned 
timeframes, including via our outlet stores and various 
clearance partners globally. Moving units between markets 
can also be an effective way of opening up new sales 
options for existing products. In FY22, we continued to 
transfer units globally, including moving units in Asia 
through clearance channels in Europe.
After putting employee sale events on hold in FY21 due 
to the pandemic, we restarted in-person employee sales 
globally in FY22. Employee sale events in North America, 
Europe and Asia allowed us to divert 72,000 units of 
excess inventory from disposal.

We advanced Ralph Lauren’s global donation principles by 
elevating partnerships that can meet both the needs of the 
communities our workforce represents and communities 
of concern and in need. We established partnerships 
with 501(c)(3) or charity-equivalent product donation 
aggregators. These organizations help ensure that we 
deepen our impact and expand our reach to those in need. 
Our primary partners for this work are Delivering Good  
and World Vision.
R E C YC L I N G
Recycling products at scale continues to be a technical 
challenge for our industry, particularly for apparel with 
blended fabrics and non-textile products like footwear 
and handbags. We are finding more opportunities to 
recycle excess products by exploring new partnerships 
and innovations. In FY22, we expanded partnerships 
with recyclers in North America and Europe and initiated 
regular recycling throughout the year. We also continued an 
upcycling pilot project in North America to apply advanced 
technologies for decoloring cotton textile waste to allow for 
spinning into recycled fabric and yarns. 
D I S P O S A L
Once all other options have been exhausted, our last resort 
is product disposal or destruction. We try to avoid this 
wherever we can and prioritize waste-to-energy disposal 
methods where available. We continue to ramp up our 
donation and recycling partnerships to avoid the need for 
disposal. Ultimately, we aim to cease this option altogether.

Environmentally responsible packaging is an 
essential part of a circular future. By 2025, 100% of 
our packaging material will be recyclable, reusable 
or sustainably-sourced, which includes packaging 
made from post-consumer or post-industrial recycled 
content, or is FSC-certified (or equivalent).
In FY22, 82% of our packaging volume met at least one 
of our sustainable packaging criteria. Additionally, we 
transitioned to a regular, standardized reporting process 
for our suppliers to allow us to track sustainable aspects of 
our packaging across brands, packaging types and regions 
throughout the year.
Our Forest Protection Policy supports our 2025 goal, 
describing our commitment to responsibly source any 
fabric, pulp and paper used in packaging. We collaborate 
with Canopy’s Pack4Good initiative, evaluating paper-
based alternatives to plastic packaging and ensuring that 
we are responsibly sourcing these paper alternatives. 
We continue to use FSC-certified paper for our hangtags 
for core items and are developing new hangtags for 
other items using paper with the same certification. In 
FY22, we made significant progress toward eliminating 
non-essential decorative tags by leveraging our digital 
development portal.
We will shift all regional polybag suppliers to using 100% 
recycled content in our plastic polybags by the end of 
FY23. This is an interim milestone as we work to reduce 
the need for polybags overall. Further, we’re continuing 
our work with partners and innovators through the Fashion 
Pact’s Oceans pillar to identify and test paper-based 
polybag alternatives in our global supply chain that meet 
our performance requirements while also being recyclable 
at scale. We are also currently working to reduce use of 
individual unit polybags in sales samples sent to offices 
and showrooms by shipping samples in master bags.
Through RalphLauren.com, our reduced packaging option 
gives customers the ability to remove plastic or paper 
inserts, hangers, garment bags, promotional materials and 
paper invoices from their orders. In FY22, we continued 
to remove and recycle all of the polybags from reduced 
packaging orders, which represented 14% of all orders 
placed through RalphLauren.com.

Chemical Management
As we monitor and reduce hazardous chemical use and 
discharge, our ultimate goal is to eliminate all hazardous 
chemicals from our product manufacturing. 
Eliminate the use of hazardous 
chemicals in our supply chain
2025 GOAL
Chemicals play an important role in the creation and 
manufacturing processes of our products. We have a 
responsibility to ensure the chemicals used to make our 
products are safe for people and the environment. Our 
Sustainable Chemical Management Policy outlines our 
approach in assessing the impacts of the chemicals in our 
supply chain and in partnering with our manufacturers in 
responsible chemical management practices.
ZERO DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS  
CHEMICALS PROGRAMME
Our work in sustainable chemical management is built upon 
a collaborative foundation among brands in our industry, 
their supply chain and chemical producers. As partners 
in the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) 
Programme, we collaborate with peers and experts to 
eliminate the use and discharge of hazardous chemicals 
across our apparel supply chain. We adopted the ZDHC 
Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) 
in FY20 to align with industry standards and help our 
suppliers track and report on all chemicals used to 
develop and manufacture our products and to prioritize 
the removal of harmful chemicals.
In FY22, we expanded our chemical transparency tool 
to cover the broader supply chain and increase visibility 
of chemical products used in our manufacturing as 
well as their conformance status with the MRSL. We 
gained transparency of chemical inventories and MRSL 
conformance status of manufacturing facilities that 
represents 72% of our supply chain spend, compared to 
31% last year. Of the chemicals reported, 82% conform 
with the MRSL, up from 59% last year. 
We established visibility to the chemical use of our Tier 
2 manufacturing facilities that represents 30% of our 
woven, knit, and sweater material business spend.1 We 
utilize the Chemical Management section within the Higg 
Index Facility Environmental Module (FEM) to assess 
the operational aspect of chemical management at the 
facility level. Based on the third-party verified assessment, 
our Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers scored an average 24 
and 39 points in the Chemical Management section, 
respectively. In order to confirm the MRSL substances 
are not intentionally used, we require manufacturing 
facilities with wet processing to test wastewater against 
the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines and share results on 
the ZDHC Gateway portal. Fifty seven percent of the Tier 
1 facilities and 29% of the Tier 2 facilities by business 
spend have performed wastewater tests in accordance 
with the Guidelines.1 Eighty four percent of the facilities 
that tested comply with the ZDHC requirement, and 
out of the substances screened, 99.9% comply with 
the ZDHC standard.

[PAGE 44 OF 96]
================================================================================
We incorporated the chemical transparency, MRSL 
conformance status and wastewater test results 
into our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES), which 
allows manufacturing facilities to be evaluated and 
scored based on their performance in sustainable 
chemical management practices. It also helps us build 
transparency in tracking progress and encourages 
continuous improvement at the facility level to ensure 
progress is made in the adoption of safer chemistry 
to achieve our goal of full MRSL conformance and 
elimination of hazardous chemicals by 2025.
We analyzed our suppliers’ data and identified common 
challenges in the implementation of sustainable chemical 
management practice at the facility level. While the 
facilities have a basic understanding of chemical 
applications, we identified the need to build up their 
capability in sustainable chemical management practices 
to align with industry standards and best practices.
In order to help close these knowledge gaps, we partner 
with a ZDHC-approved training provider to develop and 
deliver a customized capability building program for 
suppliers that provides practical technical guidance and 
industry best practices. The training program is deployed 
on a rolling basis, starting with our strategic and key 
suppliers, top wet processing facilities and top mills. Each 
supplier nominates a relevant representative (often facility 
chemical and technical managers) to take the training and 
act as a leader to effectively drive the implementation 
of sustainable chemical management practices at their 
manufacturing facilities. We also organize periodic 
webinars in collaboration with the ZDHC-approved 
chemical inventory management tool, which helps to 
strengthen our suppliers’ capabilities of self-monitoring 
their chemical inventory and MRSL conformance status. 
All of these efforts empower our suppliers to self-monitor 
their chemical use, which helps address issues at the 
source and guides conformance with the MRSL. Further, 
it also helps identify chemicals in their inventory that are 
not MRSL-certified, therefore becoming a top priority for 
phase-out.
ELIMINATION OF PFAS 
In FY22, we continued to focus on accelerating the 
elimination of PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances) in accordance with our Sustainable Chemical 
Management Policy. Over the last two fiscal years, we’ve 
collaborated cross-functionally with our manufacturing 
partners to successfully develop PFAS-free water repellent 
materials, effectively phasing out the chemical. We are in 
the final phase and on track for full elimination by the end 
of calendar year 2022. 
We recognize that an industry-wide elimination of PFAS 
requires a collaborative effort. In FY22, we joined the 
PFAS Movement, a joint initiative for corporations 
organized by ChemSec with a clear mission to drive 
stricter regulations on PFAS chemicals and encourage 
corporations to eliminate all nonessential PFAS use.
We have eliminated the use of pumice stones in all of our denim manufacturing for Polo 
and Lauren Brands. Additionally, the majority of our Polo and Lauren denim washes have 
transitioned away from the use of potassium permanganate (PP). We are working closely 
with our vendors in India and Indonesia to convert all washes from conventional washing 
methods using stone and PP to synthetic stones and PP alternatives.

In FY22, we maintained our gender parity in leadership 
representation goals for leaders at the VP level and above. 
Fifty percent of Company leaders at these levels are 
women and more than 50% of all new hires and promotions 
at the VP level and above are women.
We launched a pilot program to sponsor these female 
leaders to join two peer mentorship networks — Chief and 
the WIE Suite — spaces where female corporate leaders 
use their collective knowledge and expertise to help one 
another advance, succeed and thrive.
needed to ensure fairness of pay. We review these results 
and remediate where necessary.
Employee Engagement
Our teams are composed of people from many different 
backgrounds, and we value the varied perspectives they 
bring. We are creating a culture in which all employees 
feel welcome and can thrive through the celebration 
of identities, structured training and by encouraging 
participation in employee resource groups (ERGs). 
Ralph Lauren has a range of global employee-led 
communities and Advisory Councils, empowered to 
directly advise our Executive Leadership Team, leaders 
within specific functions, long-term business practices  
and marketing campaigns. 
These ERGs include: 
•	 Gender Parity RL Community 
•	 #RLPRIDE Community
•	 Disability, Mental Health and Wellness RL Community
•	 Working Parents RL Community 
Along with two new groups launched in FY22:
•	 Veterans RL Community 
•	 Religion, Faith and Spirituality RL Community
Both serve to broaden the inclusivity of our workforce  
and support specific experiences of their members.
Our Advisory Councils include:
•	 Black Advisory Council
•	 Native American and Indigenous Advisory Council
•	 Latin and Hispanic Advisory Council
•	 Asian and Pacific Islander Advisory Council 
•	 Our Race and Ethnicity Group in EMEA 
Many of our ERGs also welcomed new executive sponsors, 
focusing on the importance of ERG succession planning as 
a critical factor in sustaining momentum, keeping members 
engaged and passing the torch to new leadership. We are 
always striving to listen, learn and deepen our work to 
create environments that reflect the values that define our 
brand — authenticity, dignity and respect for one another. 
We want everyone to experience these values consistently.
PAY  PA R I T Y
We take a proactive approach to pay equity and continually 
monitor our compensation programs to ensure fairness. 
In Fiscal 2022, we shifted from biennial to annual 
assessments and expanded our gender pay equity 
assessment globally. In addition, we established a new 
partnership with an independent firm who is the creator 
of a software platform used to analyze our employee 
compensation based on gender, race and ethnicity. As 
of Fiscal 2022, our female employees in the U.S. earned 
an average of 99 cents for every $1 earned by males and 
98 cents for every $1 globally. In the U.S., our non-white 
employees earned an average of 99 cents for every dollar 
earned by white employees.
In addition, this software platform allows us to make a 
comparison of employees, identify pay patterns with more 
precision and determine any necessary corrective actions 
In FY22, 59% of our global new hires were 
female, an increase compared to FY21 
metrics and a return to pre-pandemic levels
In FY22, 64% of our global workforce 
was female, maintaining the prior year’s  
male-to-female ratio

Month and International Women’s Day, among others. Our 
programming strategy includes engaging cultural exchange 
opportunities such as cooking classes, dance lessons, artist 
expos, speaker series, educational forums and more. We 
empower and resource our ERGs to ideate and organize 
these initiatives and offer additional planning, development 
and execution support. 
Among the highlights from our heritage celebrations, for 
Black History Month in February 2022, our Black Advisory 
Council (BAC) nominated iconic Black figures to be 
featured in several short animations, created by Anthony 
Blue Jr. with narration by BAC members, and released 
across multiple brand social channels. This initiative led to 
the conception and creation of a mural by artist Shantell 
Martin in Brooklyn, New York, highlighting cultural icons 
who have shaped American history and inspire us to dream.
The BAC also played a critical role in the development of 
our partnership with Morehouse and Spelman Colleges  
and the Polo Ralph Lauren Exclusively for Morehouse 
and Spelman Colleges Collection.
A LEGACY OF PRIDE
A longtime ally of the LGBTQIA+ community,  
Ralph Lauren has always been inspired by those 
who champion creativity, love and self-expression. 
Through volunteer activations, corporate initiatives, 
omnichannel brand campaigns and financial grants, the 
Company and The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation 
have partnered with organizations such as Stonewall 
Community Foundation, the Hetrick-Martin Institute, 
amfAR, AIDS Walk New York, the New York City AIDS 
Memorial, God’s Love We Deliver and the Elton John 
AIDS Foundation.
Within our own Company, we are proud to offer 
transgender-inclusive healthcare benefits, which 
include coverage for gender-affirming care. As one of 
our largest ERGs, #RLPride’s membership base helps 
to lead and drive LGBTQIA+ education and awareness 
programming. For more, see LGBTQIA+ Equity 
and Inclusion.
ELEVATING ALL COMMUNITIES
We make a conscious effort to celebrate all of 
the communities that make up our diverse global 
workforce. Internally, many of these efforts occur 
during designated heritage and affinity moments such 
as Black History Month, Mental Health Awareness 
LATIN & HISPANIC ADVISORY 
COUNCIL FOCUS AREAS
In FY22, the Council kicked off Latin and 
Hispanic leadership dialogue at our stores 
during Hispanic Heritage Month to encourage 
open dialogue about issues important to 
these communities. Further, they helped 
guide clear and accurate employee 
communication with Spanish translations by 
ensuring proper translation of store signage.

KEEPING THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN
Our Courageous Conversations series has served as an 
open forum and safe space for all Ralph Lauren employees 
to comfortably share their thoughts, feelings and 
experiences. Initiated in 2020, these monthly employee 
roundtables offer a direct line to executive leadership, 
encourage education and empathy, build community and 
empower our teams to mobilize action for meaningful 
impact. They intentionally have no agenda — inviting 
employees worldwide to discuss topics pertaining to DE&I; 
react to current events and express their vulnerability.
PIN OF SOLIDARITY
In November 2021, we introduced the Ralph Lauren Pin 
of Solidarity — a timeless, tangible symbol of allyship 
and unity with Black, African and African American 
communities. Designed by our Black Advisory Council, the 
pin is intended to be a gateway for conversation, connection 
and understanding. One hundred percent of the profits 
from the sale of each pin benefit the UNCF Ralph Lauren 
Scholarship Program, created to support the educational 
endeavors of Black college students throughout the U.S. 
The pin also went on sale in five major markets throughout 
Europe in April 2022 with 100% of profits supporting the 
UK-based Stephen Lawrence Day Foundation.

We recognize and value the potential, talent and 
contribution that people with disabilities add to our 
organization. In May 2021, Ralph Lauren signed the 
Valuable 500 pledge, committing to adding disability 
awareness to our Board’s DE&I agenda. We hope this public 
commitment, made alongside 499 other brands, will help 
ignite systematic change toward disability equity.
We were proud to earn a top place on the Disability 
Equality Index, resulting in a nomination to its “2021 Best 
Places to Work for People with Disabilities” list.
We also launched a global, internal 360 disability equity 
strategy in FY22, focusing on six key pillars:
Education: Ensure all employees are  
educated and trained on disability inclusion.
Ralph Lauren earned a 100% score on the 
Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality

cognizance and belonging into our culture.
Marketing and Communications:  
Amplify the visibility of members of the  
disabled community in our internal and  
external storytelling efforts.
Talent: Increase representation of employees  
with disabilities within our global  
employee population.
Design: Integrate broader product offerings to 
better meet consumers with disability needs 
and ensure all retail and digital storefronts are 
best-in-class for accessibility.
Partnership: Identify and collaborate with key 
internal and external disability-focused partners 
to meaningfully progress our work.
During the past year, we partnered with an external 
organization to deliver keynote speaker sessions with core 
Company groups to increase awareness and understanding 
about issues within communities with disabilities and 
provide a baseline of education about our disability strategy.

Employee Well-Being
The physical, emotional, social and financial needs of our 
employees and their families is important to us. THRIVE, 
our global wellness program, provides access to benefits such  
as flexible work arrangements, sabbaticals and other support.  
In FY22, we launched the THRIVE app to give employees  
real-time access to tools to help them set measurable  
wellness goals and track their progress.
Employee Compensation  
& Benefits Equity 
Our retail and distribution and fulfillment center 
populations are the most racially and ethnically diverse 
areas of our Company. During FY22, we further expanded 
our medical benefits in the U.S. to a larger portion of our 
part-time employees, ensuring equitable benefits for our 
frontline employees. We introduced a new healthcare 
benefit for our Puerto Rico retail employees and in our U.S. 
distribution center which allows them to benefit from a 
reduction in total cost of care. Additionally, we launched a 
multi-year plan to increase hourly wages for our store and 
distribution center employees. 
Learning & Development 
We are committed to the growth and development of our 
talent and offer a wide range of development programs for 
all levels. In addition to receiving ongoing on-the-job training 
and coaching, our employees can build skills and prepare for 
the future through our Ralph Lauren Learning Portal. 
This year, we launched our Ralph Lauren Success Drivers. 
These are attributes, skills, ways of thinking and behaviors 
that create the conditions for individual and team success. 
The Success Drivers act as a common language that defines 
high performance and leadership excellence. 
We also launched our RL Learning Academy. This collection 
of customized collaborative and experiential learning 
programs are rooted in the RL Success Drivers and support 
our talents, careers, our Company culture and promote 
overall wellness and balance. We continue to build our 
learning portfolio and have added new courses this year, 
many of which focus on hybrid working, leading hybrid teams 
and DE&I education. 
Specific to DE&I education, we focused on inclusive 
leadership and added to our DE&I Curriculum the 
‘Includership’ program globally, in addition to cultural 
awareness training. We also support learning beyond our 
walls through tuition assistance and external partnerships 
and programs. These collective learning and development 
programs help foster career mobility for our employees, 
while simultaneously allowing us to fill open positions with 
existing employees who know our Company best.

We make a meaningful difference in our communities through 
our dedication to social and environmental causes and our global 
employee volunteerism.
SPP’s strategic approach is guided and defined by the 
following principles: Clearly Defined and Accessible Giving 
Processes, Authentic Partnerships and Relationships, 
Measurable Reach, Impact and Outcomes, Global 
Employee Engagement and Deliver Equity has a center-
led governance model that centralizes $5 million of our 
corporate giving budget and activities, thereby improving 
the efficacy of our programs, investments, interventions 
and impact. This department is focused on allocating 
resources to support wellness and prevention, citizenship 
and sustainability, education and DE&I culture and 
community cohort.
Increase employee volunteer hours by 25% 
compared to a FY22 baseline
2025 GOAL
The Ralph Lauren Corporation (the Company) makes 
monetary and product donations to support local 
community groups. Our Company also provides funding, 
including a portion of cause marketing proceeds, to The 
Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation (the Foundation), 
a distinct charitable entity established in 2001. 
Combined FY22 contributions from the Company and 
The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation totaled more 
than $11.4 million ($4.6 million from the Company and 
$6.8 million from the Foundation).

The Ralph Lauren  
Corporate Foundation 
The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation works to make 
the dream of a better life reality by championing equity 
and empowering underserved communities around the 
world. Established in 2001, The Ralph Lauren Corporate 
Foundation is committed to making a difference across 
its core areas of focus: supporting cancer care and 
prevention, protecting the environment, fostering advocacy 
and access and strengthening community resilience. It 
hopes to deliver meaningful change in its communities 
through its nonprofit partnerships, investments and 
volunteering programs.

Investing in the Future  
of Cotton
As our most-used raw material and a key 
component of our overall circularity efforts, 
the viability of sustainable cotton is an 
immense piece of our future. In October 2021, 
The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation 
and the Soil Health Institute announced the 
creation of the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund 
(USRCF) as a unique, farmer-facing, science-
based initiative that will support long-term, 
sustainable cotton production in the U.S. The 
fund’s goal is to eliminate one million metric 
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) from 
the atmosphere by 2026 through innovation 
in agriculture. In November 2021, it received 
recognition as an AIM for Climate Innovation 
Sprint Partner at COP26, denoting leadership 
in climate-smart agricultural practices. 
While there is no initial intention for the 
Company to source cotton from the farms 
connected to this program, we hope this work 
will make a difference through larger industry 
impact. For now, the fund is supporting efforts 
in four states and will feature opportunities 
for underrepresented students to enter this 
rapidly growing space.
In honor of its philanthropic leadership and 
stewardship towards a variety of causes through 
the years, the Ralph Lauren Corporation 
received the Lifetime Achievement Award from 
the nonprofit Delivering Good in November 
2021. This is in response to our commitment to 
extending product life cycles through national 
donation aggregators (such as Delivering Good), 
and internationally with World Vision to ensure we 
create less waste and reduce our carbon imprint 
in post-production.

C A N C E R  C A R E  &  P R E V E N T I O N
In 2003, the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care was 
established in partnership with one of the nation’s leading 
cancer centers, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
(MSK) in New York City, to provide high-quality cancer 
screening, diagnosis and treatment and to help reduce 
health disparities and improve outcomes. In 2019, MSK 
formally incorporated MSK Ralph Lauren Center (MSK 
RLC) onto its operating certificate.
Since it was founded, MSK RLC has cared for thousands of 
patients, making it a beacon for accessible, compassionate 
cancer care for residents of Harlem and beyond. MSK 
RLC’s doctors and staff offer care in a warm and welcoming 
environment. The center provides cancer screenings, 
treatment services, surgical and radiation oncology 
referrals and chemotherapy and access to clinical trials 
and supportive services, including patient navigation 
programs, financial counseling and a medically tailored 
food pantry supplemented with nutritional counseling.
Early cancer detection often leads to a better prognosis. 
People who face economic or personal hardships may 
avoid screenings because they cannot take time off 
work or from other responsibilities. In 2019, MSK RLC 
purchased a 3D mammography machine to bring state-
of-the-art care to patients closer to where they live. In 
2022, MSK RLC will expand these services: hiring an 
on-site radiologist, building a space where scans can be 
interpreted and performing on-site biopsies, which will 
reduce the time needed to diagnose breast cancer. By 
offering these services with no appointment necessary, 
MSK RLC simplifies the screening process and encourages 
community members to receive routine screenings.
Our annual Pink Pony campaign underpins our support for 
hospitals that provide cancer care and prevention. FY22 
highlights included:
•	 Leadership and/or participation in 15 events globally, 
which included fundraising, virtual and in-person 
volunteering and walks/runs in support of cancer care 
and prevention in the U.K., Italy, Iberia, Germany, France, 
Scandinavia and Switzerland. 
•	 Continued support of the Johns Hopkins Center for 
American Indian Health and its programs, focused on 
providing tribal communities cultural strengths-based 
educational tools and a patient navigator program 
designed to improve screening rates and reduce mortality 
and morbidity, particularly from breast cancer.
•	 A G2-hosted gaming event, which raised money for  
The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, a Pink Pony partner.
•	 The release of ROMANCE Pink Pony Edition, from 
which Ralph Lauren Fragrances donated 25% of the 
profits to the Pink Pony Fund of The Ralph Lauren 
Corporate Foundation.

In FY21, we launched a Pride campaign that included a 
unisex Polo Pride collection for adults and children. The 
campaign was another example of our proud support of the 
LGBTQIA+ community, spanning more than three decades.
FY22 marks the third year of our partnership with the 
Stonewall Community Foundation. The organization 
prioritizes and lifts the most vulnerable members of the 
LGBTQIA+ community, including people of color and those 
identifying as transgender, gender-nonconforming and/
or nonbinary. Through this partnership, we are proud to 
contribute to LGBTQIA+-focused organizations around 
the world. Additionally, we are evolving our partnership to 
move from donating product capsule proceeds to program-
enhancing donations, with Stonewall being our formal 
thought partner in causes related to global Pride. Our 
areas of focus will be investing in education, storytelling, 
volunteering, advocacy and access.
Launched in spring 2021, the Resilience 
Fund for Women in Global Value Chains 
is a first-of-its-kind collaborative funding 
initiative bringing investors like The Ralph 
Lauren Corporate Foundation together with 
foundations and NGO partners to invest in the 
health, safety and economic resilience of the 
women who form the backbone of global value 
chains. It aims to raise at least $10 million 
over three years to support locally driven 
solutions to the systemic problems that make 
women more vulnerable to crises like the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
The Fund was established as a joint initiative 
of BSR, the United Nations Foundation’s 
Universal Access Project and Women Win/
Win-Win Strategies in close collaboration with 
founding corporate partners and investors 
The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, PVH 
Foundation, Gap Foundation, H&M Foundation 
and the VF Foundation.
This innovative collaboration provides 
unrestricted funds to organizations in South 
Asia, trusting local and regional women’s 
funds, women-led organizations and feminist 
leaders to know what their communities need 
and enabling them to direct resources to yield 
the strongest outcomes.

More than 2.2 million Americans don’t have access to 
running water or basic plumbing. In 2020, The Ralph Lauren 
Corporate Foundation made a three-year commitment 
to DigDeep, a nonprofit helping to close the gap in water 
accessibility to help ensure that every American has 
access to clean, running water. 
The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation’s donation 
supports DigDeep’s Navajo Water Project to bring clean, 
running water to Navajo families in remote areas across 
New Mexico, Utah and Arizona. To date, the donation has 
helped fund the installation of home water systems, off-grid 
water solutions and solar power panels. 
Since its founding, DigDeep has installed over 300 Home 
Water Systems, ensuring more families have access to 
running water in their own homes. When the pandemic 
made it difficult to conduct in-home installations, DigDeep 
pivoted and created a ‘Suitcase’ Home Water System for 
contactless installation just outside family homes. These 
100 systems are currently being converted and moved 
inside for in-home water access. Through the remainder of 
calendar year 2022, DigDeep will install new Home Water 
Systems in more than 200 residences. This expansion 
accompanies assistance for first-time piped-water 
connections for up to 50 homes and piloting sanitation 
solutions in several homes for the Navajo Nation.
While the pandemic made it difficult to 
volunteer in-person, our employees found 
other ways to support worthwhile causes. 
Many participated in virtual walks, including 
the AIDS Walk, Light the Night and Race 
to Deliver, regardless of their location. 
Additionally, employees joined virtual events 
with Project Sunshine, creating activity books 
for children in hospitals. We encouraged 
employees and their families to volunteer on 
their own time with various local organizations 
in their areas if they felt safe and comfortable 
doing so. As locations and opportunities begin 
to open up once again and offer in-person 
volunteering opportunities, our goal is to 
increase employee volunteer hours by 25% 
from FY22 levels by the end of FY25.
WATERAID
In 2022, The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation launched 
a year-long partnership with WaterAid, empowering 
women in the town of Budhni, India, to make sustainable 
access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) a reality. 
Budhni is a small town with significant WASH needs that is 
more difficult to reach compared to industrial hubs where 
the situation is less acute. 
This commitment builds on The Ralph Lauren Corporate 
Foundation’s goal to address critical community needs and 
empower vulnerable populations. It supports WaterAid’s 
mission to help people in the world’s most vulnerable 
communities transform their lives through access to clean 
water, decent toilets and good hygiene.
Our partnership with WaterAid will bring clean water 
systems, hygiene and menstrual hygiene education to 
25,000 people in Budhni homes, schools and healthcare 
centers. It will also deliver essential WASH services 
to factories in coordination with another Company 
partner, HERproject™.

The Ralph Lauren Gives Back (RLGB) program enables 
our employees to volunteer year-round across social and 
environmental causes. In FY22, we adapted the program to 
meet employees where they were with broad support of a 
range of organizations. 
Inspired by employees’ passion for philanthropy and 
our Company’s culture of giving back, the Ralph Lauren 
Matching Gift program empowers employees across 
all business verticals to make a positive impact in the 
communities where they live and work. Through the 
program, donations between $25 to $1,000 made to 
nonprofit organizations by employees who have been with 
Ralph Lauren for at least one year are matched on a one-
to-one basis by The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, 
up to a total of $1 million per fiscal year. To-date, teams 
from all around the world — including corporate, retail and 
distribution employees — have taken part in this program, 
which now includes more than 500 nonprofits across 
15 countries.
As the global employee community returns to their 
workspaces and our partners fully reactivate their 
programs and events, our goals will align to this movement. 
The future of RL volunteering include the following goals:
•	 Create full company engagement strategy to reach our 
global community 
•	 An increase to four RLGB volunteer months (April, 
August, October, December) versus the previous 
designation of three weeks
•	 Increase employee volunteer hours by 25% by FY25 
•	 Increase volunteer organization representation that 
aligns to the diversity of our global workforce
Giving Time and Talent 
Our SPP team works in cohort with the broader 
Company to support our social and environmental 
causes. Additionally, SPP ensures the empowerment and 
facilitation of our global employee groups. We strengthen 
their efforts to give back, educate and engage in alignment 
with our volunteerism goals.

Rights and Empowerment 
in the Supply Chain
At Ralph Lauren, we are committed to conducting our global 
operations ethically with respect for the dignity of all people who 
make our products, putting factory workers at the center of our 
approach to human rights and worker empowerment. 
Make empowerment and life skills programs 
available to 250,000 workers across our 
supply chain 
Achieve a 25% increase of women in factory 
leadership that seeks to create a path to parity

2025 GOAL
FY23 GOAL
Putting Factory Workers  
at the Center 
We believe that workers realize a better life through safe, 
enabling, inclusive and sustainable workplaces. To support 
this, Ralph Lauren works with suppliers to build capabilities, 
with workers to engage and empower and with industry 
partners to collaborate for positive change. 
Our comprehensive approach to supply chain management 
integrates risk assessment, monitoring, remediation 
and capability building with life skills programs and 
empowerment opportunities, which supports the rights 
and well-being of the factory workers in our supply chain. 
Our Commitment to Respect 
Human Rights
Our purpose to inspire the dream of a better life through 
authenticity and timeless style is grounded in a commitment 
to respect the human rights of all those who are affected by 
our global operations. Our Human Rights Policy outlines this 
commitment in detail.
We implement this policy through our human rights due 
diligence (HRDD) efforts where we seek to identify, prevent, 
mitigate and remediate any adverse human rights impacts 
in alignment with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for

Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment & Footwear 
Sector and the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGP). 
Underlying these efforts is a robust risk assessment 
process that identifies where and how risk is evolving in 
our own operations and supply chain. We leverage the 
outcomes of our risk assessment to identify salient risks 
and prioritize actual and potential negative impacts on 
people. These findings are integrated into our decision-
making process and inform our prevention and mitigation 
activities. In our supply chain, we have prioritized our 
efforts for vulnerable groups, such as women and foreign 
migrant workers (FMWs), in addition to cornerstone issues, 
such as fair compensation.
Read more about how we respect the rights of factory 
workers in our Human Rights Disclosure.
Championing Workers
The issues that impact workers are interconnected, and 
therefore, we take an integrated approach to support 
better lives for workers in our supply chain. To that end, we 
are focusing on empowerment through life skills, women’s 
leadership and wages to drive long-lasting and systemic 
impact. We chose these areas because they address the 
root causes of issues in our supply chain and are areas 
where we believe we can drive positive impact. We further 
recognize the structural challenges of the global garment 
supply chain operating in shared factories where other 
brands also source. We are collaborating with stakeholders 
across the industry to increase efficiency and scale impact.
To fully champion workers, they must be empowered with 
knowledge and skills to advocate for themselves. Given 
that most industry garment workers are women, we have 
a specific focus on empowering women in our supply 
chain. Empowering women to take control of their health 
and other aspects of their life, like personal finances, 
professional development and equipping them with the 
knowledge and skills to effectively manage them, removes 
barriers that affect their ability to attend school or work 
regularly, both of which impact their income. To achieve 
our goal of empowering more than 250,000 workers in our 
supply chain through life skills programs and training, we 
partner with a range of local specialists.
HEALTH EDUCATION AND DIGITAL LEARNING 
We have a long-standing partnership with BSR to sponsor 
HERproject™, a collaborative initiative to empower women 
working in global supply chains. This initiative offers 
several workplace-based interventions on topics that are 
important to workers. Currently, we are participating in 
HERhealth™ in Bangladesh and Vietnam.
In FY22, we co-sponsored the adaptation and pilot of 
HERessentials™ in India to build workers’ adaptive capacity 
and resilience in the face of crisis through digital learning. 
This app-based program engages workers and managers on 
health, financial inclusion and gender equality. The program 
is designed to increase the digital literacy of workers in some 
cases, this may be the first time that workers have had the 
opportunity to use electronic tablets, empowering women in 
an increasingly technology-driven world.

In FY23, as part of a brand collaboration, we will sponsor 
the adaptation and pilot of HERessentials™ in Guatemala 
— a country of focus for our women’s empowerment work. 
The completed HERhealth™ trainings at RL-supplying 
factories have reported positive outcomes, such as:
•	 On average, a 36 percentage point increase in the 
number of women using menstrual hygiene products.
•	 On average, a 13 percentage point increase in the number 
of women using modern family planning methods.
•	 On average, a 35 percentage point increase in the 
number of women who strongly agree with having  
high confidence in speaking to management about a 
work issue.
To date, these programs have impacted almost 43,000 
workers (with over 66% identifying as women), exceeding 
our goal of impacting 40,000 workers through the 
HERproject™ by 2023. 
We adapt our approach not only to circumstances like the 
global pandemic, but also to different geographies and 
settings. In China, groups of highly skilled hand knitters 
produce sweaters for women’s Polo and Collection. These 
women do not have access to the workplace wellness 
programs of a traditional factory environment, so we fulfill 
our commitment to women’s health and empowerment 
through our local partner Training Auditing Organization 
Systems (TAOS) Network delivering health education to 
these women directly in the villages. 
At other times, our work requires us to align, simplify and 
build off the good work that others have already done.  
This is why we look forward to participating in the 
Empower@Work collaborative, which brings together  
some of the world’s largest women’s empowerment 
programs in global supply chains to leverage their 
experience and deliver a harmonized approach.

We recognize the longstanding forced labor risks 
to young women and girls working in the spinning 
and textile mills across the South Indian state of 
Tamil Nadu. In FY22, we joined a multi-stakeholder 
initiative implemented by a local non-governmental 
organization Social Awareness and Voluntary 
Education (SAVE) along with three other brands to 
mitigate these risks and create a textile and garment 
industry that respects human rights, empowers 
workers and promotes fair recruitment practices in 
mills and factories across Tamil Nadu. 
The project focuses on 1) the labor agents who 
recruit workers to the mills; 2) the community where 
workers are from; and 3) the spinning mills who 
employ them, to bring about positive changes. As 
many mills rely on labor agents to recruit workers, 
ensuring that these agents are aware of legal 
requirements and best practices is key to preventing 
forced and child labor. To that end, the program 
trains labor agents on fair recruitment practices. 
Within the community, the program emphasizes 
building awareness on financial literacy, legal rights, 
reproductive health, pre-departure training and 
more. As most of the workers may be economically 
vulnerable and socially marginalized, teaching these 
life skills is critical to developing the awareness 
and confidence to handle difficult situations both in 
their personal and professional lives. Training and 
tools are also introduced at the mill-level, including 
Timby, a technology enabled platform for workers 
to raise concerns and grievances about any aspect 
of the employment process, including recruitment 
and working conditions. This platform will be rolled 
out in participating mills and the community to help 
develop stronger worker-manager relationships 
and communication channels among stakeholders. 
We plan to roll out the program to more than 1,000 
mill workers from three RL-nominated spinning 
mills and 3,000 workers in the broader Tamil Nadu 
community by February 2023.

INCREASING WOMEN IN FACTORY LEADERSHIP 
Complementing our commitment to equal representation 
in leadership positions at the VP level and above in our 
internal operations, we are also committed to increasing 
the percentage of women in factory leadership. 
On average, women account for 65% of the workforce at 
our suppliers, a level which is typical for our sector, but is 
a fall of two percentage points from the number of female 
workers last year. A similar trend is seen in the ratio of 
female supervisors to total supervisors, which stands 
at 40% in FY22, a four percentage point decrease from 
FY21. This decrease may reflect the global impact of the 
pandemic on women in the workforce who have been 
slower to recover pandemic-related job losses than men. 
Despite this global setback, we are committed to realizing 
our goal of increasing women in factory leadership. 
Our efforts are focused on countries where our gender 
ratio data shows the most opportunity for improvement: 
Bangladesh, Guatemala, India and Peru. For this work to 
be sustainable we are taking a holistic approach, where 
we focus both on empowering and upskilling the female 
workers to be able to take on these leadership roles, but 
also work on the wider factory systems with the managers 
to counter approaches that have previously prevented 
these women from accessing more senior roles. 
In FY22, we continued our partnership with the IFC and 
ILO in Bangladesh to implement the Gender Equality 
and Returns (GEAR) Program. GEAR aims to ease the 
path for women working in garment factories to progress 
into supervisory roles, which improves their access to 
better jobs, contributes to increased line-level productivity 
and reduces gender imbalances at management levels. 
We invited all our supplier factories in Bangladesh to 
participate in GEAR. This program launched at the end 
of FY20 and we rolled out our final cohort of factories in 
FY22. To date, the factories that have completed the GEAR 
training have an average promotion rate of 60% of trainees. 
Notably, three of the factories that completed GEAR did 
not previously have a single female supervisor. We expect 
that all scheduled factories will complete GEAR training 
with an average promotion rate of 50% of trainees, thereby 
increasing the percentage of women in supervisory roles in 
our supply chain.
In Peru, where we are working with our strategic suppliers 
on gender action plans, we have also seen an increase 
of 6% of women in factory leadership. In Guatemala and 
India, our progress has been delayed due to COVID-19 and 
factory access issues. We are working to identify ways to 
accelerate progress where possible in FY23 and beyond.
While we are over halfway towards achieving our female 
leadership goal in our focus sourcing countries, we 
know that sustaining these results is the key, especially 
considering the disproportionate challenges that women 
continue to face through the pandemic. Our life skills and 
empowerment programs that support women workers 
will help us address some of the structural barriers that 
make achieving gender equity a challenging, yet critically 
important endeavor. In FY23, we will be partnering with 
the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) 
together with a number of other brands and retailers 
to assess and address the barriers that women face in 
the workplace.
Creating diverse, equal and inclusive workplaces is 
something Ralph Lauren strives hard to accomplish, in our 
supply chains, as in our own operations. This year, our DE&I 
workstream, made up of our strategic suppliers, continued 
to meet online quarterly. Building off the work focused on 
the diversity dimensions of gender and age from last year, 
we focused this year’s discussions on language and culture 
and how this impacts inclusion in the workplace.

================================================================================
As a result, our strategic suppliers updated or developed 
their new DE&I strategies and presented these strategies 
to fit their respective local contexts. In addition to 
other strategic priorities, we hope this work promotes 
work cultures that further the promotion of women into 
leadership roles.
W A G E  M A N A G E M E N T
We are collaborating with suppliers to develop their 
capabilities to address living wages, a salient human rights 
issue. We directly address the issue of living wages through 
our Wage Management Strategy. Our focus is on wage 
management systems at the factory level and the impact 
of our own purchasing practices to encourage suppliers to 
deliver fair compensation to workers in our supply chain. 
WAGE DATA INSIGHTS
Wage data analysis is the foundation of our approach to 
improving wage management at suppliers. We continue to 
gather detailed wage data from suppliers, most recently 
in Bangladesh. This ongoing analysis of wage levels and 
structures and the ability to monitor relative performance 
between suppliers help inform our wage strategy. We do 
this work collaboratively with suppliers as we understand 
that there are multiple factors that determine wage levels.
In FY22, we shared more than 72 detailed wage ladders 
with suppliers and their factories. This wage ladder tool 
benchmarks them against other factories locally and 
across product groups. Suppliers reported that these 
ladders help them understand prevailing wage levels in 
their regions and to consider how to use compensation 
more strategically to recruit the best workers.
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FAIR WAGE NETWORK
The Fair Wage Network (FWN) is an independent nonprofit that we partnered with over the last year to carry 
out a series of fair wage assessments in Italy and India. These assessments have provided deeper insight 
into suppliers’ performance on living wages, validated our wage data collection efforts and provided us the 
opportunity to hear directly from workers about their wages. 
In FY22, fair wage assessments were conducted with some of our strategic and key suppliers in Italy and India. 
The FWN results for Italy have confirmed our findings that suppliers not only pay above the minimum wage 
set by sectoral collective bargaining, but also above the living wage level for Italy. The suppliers all achieved 
at least FWN’s “relatively fair” score, the second highest level, based on an assessment of FWN’s 12 Fair Wage 
dimensions. One supplier reached the top level and a “Fair Wage” certification. 
Areas identified for improvement included tying wages to worker performance and to skills, worker 
representation and a lack of a coherent wage policy within human resources and sustainability strategies. 
Workers themselves expressed the need for improved social dialogue around wage policies. 
The fair wage assessments for India are ongoing and we expect results by Q1 of FY23. Results and learnings 
from our collaboration with FWN will continue to inform the Wage Management Strategy.

Wage Management Tools 
We continue to develop tools to support suppliers 
to improve their wage management systems, their 
understanding of the cost of recruitment and to link wages 
to workers’ skills. We are also developing a “Wage Maturity 
Index,” a diagnostic and remediation tool that assesses 
suppliers’ approach to wage management and provides 
guidance on how to improve across the dimensions that 
influence wages such as worker training and performance 
management. These tools will be piloted next year ahead of 
a wider roll out across our supply chain.
Factory Improvement Program
Insights drawn from our wage data analysis last year 
identified the largest opportunities to improve wages in 
our supply chain in Cambodia, Indonesia, India and in 
certain product categories in Vietnam. It is therefore in 
these regions where we are beginning our in-factory work 
to improve wage systems, labor productivity and worker 
engagement. This is done in partnership with suppliers, 
supported by local labor productivity and human resource 
management specialists and our own Ralph Lauren 
cross functional team. As we continue to scale this work 
with other strategic and key suppliers, we will evolve the 
program to optimize our impact. 
Supplier Summits
In partnership with our Sourcing team, we held supplier 
summits on wage management where we discussed the 
importance of strong wage management systems and 
how strategic compensation is a tool to attract and retain 
talent, especially when labor markets are competitive. In 
Bangladesh, specifically, we held a supplier roundtable and 
training session to introduce our wage strategy and discuss 
what a living wage is, why it’s important and why data 
collection is the key first step.
Responsible Purchasing Practices
Our work on Responsible Purchasing Practices helps 
us create the conditions for factories to deliver fair 
compensation. For more information, please see 
Responsible Sourcing.

Tier 2 Supplier  
Management Systems  
Development Program
We use capability building as part of our 
program to drive sustainable social and 
labor improvement through strengthening 
management systems. We also leverage 
capability building to proactively address 
salient human rights risks or reactively as a 
form of remediation. In FY22, we assessed 
our top fabric mills in four countries: China, 
Taiwan, Vietnam and India. Upon receiving 
the assessment results, we noticed non-
compliance trends across health and safety, 
record keeping and grievance mechanisms. 
To remediate these issues, we worked with a 
local firm to develop training to support the 
mills in understanding the importance of social 
compliance and how to develop a proper 
management system. The firm conducted 
a training session, provided management 
system templates and offered remote support 
to complete the templates that would be 
appropriate for their operations. This level of 
collaboration helped our suppliers learn and 
build a stronger framework and system to 
support social and labor compliance.

Our Global Citizenship team monitors supplier compliance 
as part of our due diligence processes. The team has an 
established communication and engagement approach 
with cross-functional teams and suppliers.
We regularly evaluate supplier relationships based on their 
performance and potential. This starts with our Operating 
Standards (“OS”), which communicate our expectations 
of suppliers. In FY22, we updated our OS to align with 
best practices more closely on fair compensation, use 
of homeworking and equal pay for equal work with a 
particular focus on vulnerable groups, including women. We 
communicated the changes in our OS to suppliers through 
our new supplier manual with training provided internally 
and to suppliers. With the launch of the supplier manual, 
we are guiding our suppliers further on our expectations of 
providing a safe and comfortable workplace.
All new suppliers must meet our standards before we 
place an order with them. We undertake due diligence with 
existing suppliers by scoping potential risks, preventing 
and mitigating identified risks through supplier and other 
assessments and remediating issues when found. Our 
approach encourages transparency and continuous 
improvement. We work with suppliers to identify the root 
cause of issues — such as inadequate management 
systems or lack of training — and agree on corrective 
action plans (“CAPs”) that prioritize workers’ welfare and 
livelihoods. We remain committed to ensuring that workers 
have access to effective grievance mechanisms and that 
they can voice their concerns to factory management 
without fear of retaliation. Read more about how we 
are working with suppliers. 
Alongside industry-wide assessment tools, like Better 
Work and the Social & Labor Convergence Program 
(“SLCP”), we use independent third-party assessments to 
complement our continuous due diligence and site-based 
risk monitoring processes. Assessment results segment 
factories into different groups, increasing or decreasing 
their overall risk profile. These risk profiles feed into our 
overall supplier scoring in our Supplier Engagement 
Strategy (“SES”) which directly influences our sourcing 
decisions, and our strategy for managing, mitigating and 
eliminating risks in our supply chain.
In FY22, all our active factories received a risk rating. Most 
factories (58%) were rated as medium risk (yellow). We saw 
a nine percentage point increase in low-risk (green), a one 
percentage point increase in high-risk (red) ratings and  
saw a five percentage point decrease in high-medium  
risk (orange).

We take a risk-based approach to our assessments to 
ensure we are prioritizing areas for action. We assessed 
84% of factories supplying Ralph Lauren in FY22, 
representing 82% of our business volume. We also assessed 
key subcontractors in FY22 with 110 assessments. At Tier 2, 
we monitored fabric mill suppliers that made up 36% of our 
core fabric business, using SLCP. We were able to conduct 
21% more assessments in FY22 than FY21 because of a 
decrease in COVID restrictions. 
The most common categories of nonconformance were 
health and safety (58%), wages and benefits (12%) and 
working hours (11%). After reviewing all nonconformance 
issues with the supplier, we agree on a corrective action 
plan and follow up to ensure issues are addressed in a 
timely manner. 
Less than 1% of assessment findings revealed 
zero-tolerance issues (28 of 4,640 total findings). 
We deactivated five factories that were unable to 
remediate these issues or other OS requirements.

We recognize the industry-wide need to 
streamline the monitoring process, reduce 
audit fatigue and re-allocate resources to 
further drive impact to workers through 
capability building and worker well-being 
initiatives. As such, Ralph Lauren is committed 
to scaling positive impact via industry tools 
and partnerships. We are adopting the SLCP to 
complement our social compliance assessment 
tools. SLCP is an industry-wide data collection 
tool that aims to create an efficient and 
sustainable solution for social and labor 
assessments. Better Work also adopted this 
mutually recognized assessment in 2021.
Our adoption of SLCP reinforces our approach 
to supplier management. We understand 
that it is essential to shift our focus from 
monitoring to capability building to support 
our suppliers so that they can focus their 
resources on having sustainable improvement 
with solid management systems to champion 
better lives of their workers. Adopting SLCP 
creates an opportunity for us to partner with 
industry stakeholders (e.g., suppliers and other 
brands) who also accept the verified results to 
jointly remediate and increase the capability 
of our suppliers to build a socially sustainable 
supply chain.
We aim to adopt these tools and programs 
to factories representing at least 50% of RL 
direct business and will increase our adoption 
to factories producing 80% of RL direct 
business by FY25. At the same time, we will 
expand the adoption of SLCP to upstream 
suppliers in FY23 and beyond.

Ongoing Dialogue with Suppliers 
In FY22, we rolled out a new supplier dialogue tool to 
engage with suppliers beyond assessments. This tool 
covers demographic information, country-level and 
factory-level risks. Our Global Citizenship staff use the 
tool to conduct two-way supplier dialogue, allowing for 
more touch points with suppliers and an iterative process 
to better assess social compliance, understand supplier 
and worker needs and tailor capability-building. The tool 
can be deployed rapidly to assess emerging situations. For 
example, we used such interactions to better understand 
the impact on suppliers as COVID variants brought new 
and unexpected challenges. In FY22, we used the tool to 
engage with 69 factories.
Working with Licensees 
In addition to our own products, we license the Ralph 
Lauren brands to selected companies. All licensees 
are required to have social compliance programs and 
standards equivalent to our own. We separately assess 
licensee supplier compliance programs and review their 
assessments to ensure that they meet our requirements. 
In FY22, 28 licensees used approximately 332 factories to 
make licensed products.

•	 Cooling consumption: 3,479 GJ 
•	 Steam consumption: 11,085 GJ
•	 Total energy consumption within the organization: 861,496 GJ
Standards, methodologies, assumptions, calculation tools and conversion factors 
used: World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Energy consumption 
calculated for energy from natural gas, diesel, propane, fuel oil, electricity, steam 
and cooling consumed at global owned and operated retail stores, offices and 
distribution centers. Site-specific energy use is determined using a three-tiered 
system, depending on the availability of primary data for the fiscal year. If we 
have primary data for all months that a facility was operating in the fiscal year, the 
energy usage data is simply summed. If we have partial primary data, a regression 
is attempted based on typical yearly weather data to fill gaps. Finally, if the 
regression fails or we have no primary data, we model yearly energy using facility 
square footage and an energy use intensity based on the climate zone and 
facility type.

Interactions with water as a 
shared resource
In FY22, we continued to collaborate with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to advance 
our work in this area and set a comprehensive strategy for water stewardship 
and water use reductions in our value chain. Our goal to reduce water use by 
at least 20% by 2025 relates to manufacturing and processing in our supply 
chain and water use in our owned and operated facilities, compared to an FY20 
baseline of 14,870,315 m3. In FY22, our footprint was 11,351,306 m3. We are in the 
process of setting contextual water targets to better align our reduction goal 
with surrounding water challenges. In priority water-stressed locations, we are 
contributing in collective action projects and local partnerships to scale water use 
assessments and reduction strategies. Through our FY21 water risk analysis, we 
identified priority basins in our supply chain that are in great need for watershed 
conservation, reduced water consumption and improved community access to 
water. More details on our water footprint is available in the Water Stewardship 
section on page 35 of our 2022 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report.
In FY22, we joined WWF’s Noyyal-Bhavani Collective Action Program to help 
address industry impacts on freshwater in the region in collaboration with WWF-
India and two other corporate partners. The objective of the collective action 
program is to ensure that by 2030, the Noyyal and Bhavani sub-basins are healthy 
river ecosystems that ensure water security for people and nature. Within our 
manufacturing supply chain, we are supporting our suppliers to set water reduction 
targets through the Carbon Leadership Program in collaboration with the Apparel 
Impact Institute (aii). In FY22, nominated facilities set water reduction 
targets ranging up to 72% by 2030 against their 2019 baseline.
Other water stewardship initiatives in FY22 include: 
•	 Continued our direct collaboration with manufacturers in improving water use 
efficiency. Since FY20, we have been working closely with our suppliers to adopt 
more water-efficient processing for our materials and product manufacturing. 
These transitions have helped our suppliers avoid an estimated 169,992 cubic 
meters of water use in FY22.
•	 Launched an open-source ECOFAST manual in collaboration with Dow to support faster 
adoption of an improved dyeing process. This effort aims to help the industry integrate 
new methods to reduce the amount of water, chemicals and energy needed to 
color cotton.
•	 Continued to reduce the use of water-intensive chemicals and processing in the 
production of our core Polo and Lauren denim products. For more information, 
see Chemical Management on page 43. 
In FY22, we submitted our first CDP Water Response, with plans to increase our 
disclosures in this area in the future. We will submit our first scored CDP Water 
response in FY23, as part of our effort in increasing transparency in water-related 
impact across the industry.

supplier fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations. In addition to 
that, we are screening our supply base for any potential significant environmental 
impacts through the Higg Index Facility Environmental Module and the Institute 
of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) Supervision platform (the latter is 
specific to China-based facilities). If an issue is found, we require the supplier to 
take corrective action and put in place preventive measures to avoid recurrence. 
Specifically, on any violation record found on the IPE platform, we also require the 
facilities — at a minimum — to publish enterprise feedback onto the platform, 
which details the corrective and preventive measures taken.
In FY22, we screened all our Tier 1 facilities and our top mills through these 
platforms. We identified 13 facilities with potential significant environmental 
impacts related to industrial wastewater, permits and air emissions. We do not use 
Higg FEM assessment results or IPE records to terminate business relationships 
with suppliers. We addressed all the identified facilities to ensure corrective action 
and preventive measures are in place.

MANAGEMENT OF CHEMICALS IN PRODUCTS
Discussion

to maintain 
compliance 
with restricted 
substances 
regulations
CG-AA-250a.1
Ralph Lauren has Vendor Compliance Packets (VCP) for all mills and finished-goods suppliers. The VCP states suppliers 
must comply with American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA) Restricted Substances List (RSL). We adopt the AAFA 
RSL to serve as a practical tool that sets forth specific chemical substance bans, limitations or test methods, as specified by 
government or regulatory agencies. 
We test to the strictest global standard. Tests are performed through our Apparel Testing Program, which ensures our products 
meet compliance requirements, regardless of their markets of distribution. It also contains protocols on how tests should be 
conducted, including all fabrics, trims or related materials, apparel, accessories, footwear, home textiles and components that 
are supplied or sold to our Company for use in the manufacturing or distribution of any Ralph Lauren product. A zero tolerance 
policy is in effect on any product not meeting the RLC standards as defined in the protocol. Suppliers are required to use only 
Ralph Lauren nominated independent third-party testing labs to achieve passing test reports for raw materials and finished 
products prior to the shipping of product. 
We also use independent third-party labs to conduct raw material risk assessments of our lines each year to ensure our raw 
material suppliers are clear with our development standards and deliver fabric that will meet our compliance requirements. 
The raw material risk assessment result will reset fabric testing and garment testing standards if needed. As such, fabric 
testing cannot begin until an approved raw material risk assessment exists. 
Our three stages of testing are: 
1. Fabric testing for apparel: The testing is required for bulk yardage in all colorways and where approved raw material risk 
assessment exists. A completed and passing fabric test is valid for six months. 
2. Component testing for apparel, footwear and accessories: Suppliers are allowed to test the raw material and 
subcomponents used to produce an item. A completed and passing subcomponent test is valid for 12 months. 
3. Finished-goods testing for home, apparel and footwear: Finished goods testing must be done in bulk fabric with bulk trim 
items. A completed and passing finished goods test is valid for six months.

Discussion of 
processes to assess 
and manage risks 
and/or hazards 
associated with 
chemicals in 
products
CG-AA-250a.2
Our process for assessing and managing risks and/or hazards associated with chemicals in products is described above. 
Policies and practices are fully aligned across our brands and product categories. As described above, all raw materials and 
finished products undergo testing to confirm compliance with regulations. Depending on the volume of orders, some styles  
may undergo more testing than others. We take a combination of hazard- and risk-based approaches to chemical management. 
As mentioned above, we complete extensive risk assessments each year by raw material. We are fully compliant with all laws 
and regulations and are currently exploring innovations for reduction, elimination or assessment outside of that scope. The 
third-party certifications used and our approach to chemical management at each stage of the product life cycle are  
discussed above.
We partner with the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) to work towards the alignment and collective action 
across the industry in monitoring and eliminating the usage and discharge of hazardous chemicals in textile, apparel and 
leather manufacturing, as well as promoting the development and adoption of safer chemical alternatives. We aim to eliminate 
the use of hazardous chemicals in our supply chain by 2025. We fully adopt the ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted Substances 
List (MRSL) and have communicated expectations to our supply chain through our Sustainable Chemicals Management Policy, 
as well as our VCP.
In FY22, we expanded our chemical transparency tool to cover the broader supply chain and increase visibility of chemical 
products used in our manufacturing as well as their conformance status with the MRSL. We gained transparency of chemical 
inventories and MRSL conformance status of manufacturing facilities that represents 72% of our supply chain spend, 
compared to 31% last year. Of the chemicals reported, 82% conforms with the MRSL, up from 59% last year. Eighty-two percent 
of the chemicals reported conform with the MRSL. We established visibility to the chemical use our Tier 2 manufacturing 
facilities that represents 30% of our woven, knit, and sweater material business spend.1 We utilize the Chemical Management 
section within the Higg Index Facility Environmental Module (FEM) to assess the operational aspect of chemical management 
at the facility level. Based on the third-party verified assessment, our Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers scored an average 24 and 39 
points in the Chemical Management section, respectively. In order to confirm the MRSL substances are not intentionally used, 
we require manufacturing facilities with wet processing to test wastewater against the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines and share 
results on the ZDHC Gateway portal. Fifty-seven percent of the Tier 1 facilities and 29% of the Tier 2 facilities2 by business 
spend have performed wastewater test in accordance with the Guidelines. Eighty-four percent of the facilities that tested 
comply with the ZDHC requirement, and out of the substances screened, 99.9% comply with the ZDHC standard. 
We incorporated the chemical transparency, MRSL conformance status and wastewater test results into our Supplier 
Engagement Strategy (SES), which allows manufacturing facilities to be evaluated and scored based on their performance 
in sustainable chemical management practices. It also helps us build transparency in tracking progress and encourages 
continuous improvement at the facility level to ensure progress is made in the adoption of safer chemistry to achieve our goal 
of full MRSL conformance and elimination of hazardous chemicals by 2025. We analyzed our suppliers’ data and identified 
common challenges in the implementation of sustainable chemical management practice at the facility level. While the 
facilities have a basic understanding of chemical applications, we identified the need to build up their capability in sustainable 
chemical management practices to align with industry standards and best practices.
In conjunction with these collaborative efforts, we developed a chemical phaseout program internally as an initiative to 
proactively eliminate the use of the priority chemicals in current and future design and production. In FY22, we continued 
to focus on accelerating the elimination of PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in accordance with our 
Sustainable Chemical Management Policy. Over the last two fiscal years, we’ve collaborated cross-functionally with our 
manufacturing partners to successfully develop PFAS-free water repellent materials, effectively phasing out the chemical.  
We are in the final phase and on track for full elimination by the end of calendar year 2022. We recognize that an industry-wide 
elimination of PFAS requires a collaborative effort. In FY22, we joined the PFAS Movement, a joint initiative for corporations 
organized by ChemSec with a clear mission to drive stricter regulations on PFAS chemicals and encourage corporations to 
eliminate all non-essential PFAS use.
We have eliminated the use of pumice stones in all of our denim manufacturing for Polo and Lauren Brands. Additionally, the 
majority of our Polo and Lauren denim washes have transitioned away from the use of potassium permanganate (PP). We are 
working closely with our vendors in India and Indonesia to convert all washes from conventional washing methods, using stone 
and PP, to synthetic stones and PP alternatives.

CG-AA-430a.1
In FY22, 98.9% of Tier 1 direct supplier facilities were in compliance with wastewater discharge permits and/or contractual 
agreements.
We explicitly state in our Vendor Compliance and Operating Standards that all suppliers are required to adhere to all 
applicable laws and regulations of the regions where they operate, included, but not limited to, the local environmental 
standards. We have the right to terminate our business relationship should the supplier fail to comply with the applicable 
laws and regulations. Our compliance audit also includes the compliance to wastewater regulations as part of the health and 
safety requirement.
Our main supply chain risks associated with the wastewater discharge are related to the usage of chemicals in production 
and the effluent treatment system put in place.
Our supplier facilities implement effluent treatment methods in accordance with the local regulatory requirements. This may 
include operating an on-site effluent treatment plant (ETP), partnering with an off-site ETP and, for some, implementing a 
zero liquid discharge effluent treatment system.
In addition to the regulatory compliance, we adopt the ZDHC MRSL and its suite of tools to guide and align our efforts to 
eliminate the use and discharge of hazardous chemicals with the industry’s standards and best practices. This includes the 
implementation of ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines, which goes beyond the regulatory compliance. The ZDHC Wastewater 
Guidelines provide clear guidance in effluent testing methods, parameters, limits and reporting approach as a way to 
confirm that our manufacturing facility is not discharging hazardous chemicals to the environment. We expanded the roll 
out of the ZDHC Wastewater Test in our supply base as part of our sustainable chemicals management initiative to monitor 
the facility’s conformance against the ZDHC MRSL. While the wastewater test is only a snapshot of the effluent quality of 
the facility, it ensures an annual monitoring that allows us to follow up and address any nonconformance from its source 
through a root cause analysis approach that aligns with the ZDHC. This helps inform both the facility and Ralph Lauren on 
targeted chemicals phaseout at the facility level. Fifty-seven percent of the Tier 1 facilities by business spend have performed 
wastewater test in accordance with the Guidelines. Eighty-four percent of the facilities that tested comply with the ZDHC 
requirement, and out of the substances screened, 99.9% comply with the ZDHC standard.

RAW MATERIALS SOURCING
Description of 
environmental 
and social risks 
Discussion and 
associated with 
sourcing priority 
raw materials 
Analysis
CG-AA-440a.1
We identify priority (key) raw materials based on three criteria: top volume materials, such as cotton, materials with high 
environmental and social risks and impacts, such as cashmere and materials of high importance to the Ralph Lauren brand, 
such as down. The scope of our risk assessment includes apparel and other Ralph Lauren products, including home goods, 
footwear and accessories. We identified seven key raw materials: cotton, polyester, leather, cashmere, wool, down and viscose. 
The environmental risks associated with these raw materials include water scarcity and stress, climate change, soil health, 
chemical management and animal welfare. The primary social risks include unsafe workplace conditions, exposure to toxic 
chemicals and unfair pay.
To manage our risk associated with priority raw materials, we set a 2025 goal for 100% of our key materials to be sustainably 
sourced. We also set a goal for 100% of our animal-derived materials — as covered by our Animal Welfare Policy — to be 
certified to an animal welfare standard and traceable by 2025. We define sustainably sourced with specific standards and 
certifications for each key raw material.
In partnership with World Wildlife Fund (WWF), we conducted a global water risk assessment in FY21 across the Ralph Lauren 
value chain. In FY22, we continued to collaborate with WWF to advance our conservation work and set a comprehensive 
strategy for water stewardship and water use reductions in our value chain, including the risk associated with cotton growing. 
Our key cotton growing regions, including India and China, are vulnerable to water scarcity and stress. To reduce these 
risks, we are continuing to support cotton grown according to the Better Cotton Initiative, whose mission is to address the 
environmental, social and economic issues associated with growing cotton. In 2021, we sourced more than 19,000 metric tons 
of cotton lint sourced as Better Cotton. By 2025, 100% of our cotton will be sustainably sourced. Utilizing recycled cotton and 
polyester fibers is another way we are mitigating raw material risks to reduce carbon emissions, energy and natural resources 
needed to produce virgin materials. We leverage trusted third-party standards, such as the Responsible Wool and Down 
Standards. We are also researching recycled alternatives to reduce our use of virgin material. 
Our raw materials assessment and goals are disclosed in the Sustainable Materials section on page 14 of our 2022 Global 
Citizenship & Sustainability Report.
