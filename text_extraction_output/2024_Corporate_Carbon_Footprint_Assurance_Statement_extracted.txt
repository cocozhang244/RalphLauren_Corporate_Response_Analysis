Brief Description of Verification Process
TUVR has been contracted by RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION for the verification of direct and indirect carbon dioxide (CO2) 
equivalent emissions as provided by RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION, 650 Madison Avenue, New York, NY10022, USA, in 
their GHG Assertion in the form of a “Global Citizenship & Sustainability” Report including CO2 equivalent emissions. 
The management of RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION is responsible for the organization’s GHG information system, the 
development and maintenance of records and reporting procedures in accordance with that system, including the calculation 
and determination of GHG emissions information and the reported GHG emissions. 
 
It is TUVR’s responsibility to express an independent GHG verification opinion on the emissions as provided in the RALPH 
LAUREN CORPORATION GHG Assertion for the period of Fiscal Year 2024 from 02/04/2023 to 30/03/2024 
TUVR conducted a third-party verification following the requirements of ISO 14064-3:2019 of the provided CO2 equivalent 
assertion during July and August 2024. 
 
The assessment included a desk review of the GHG Assertion and supporting data presented. The verification was based on 
the verification scope, objectives and criteria as agreed between RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION and TUVR on 22/04/2024.
Level of Assurance
The level of assurance agreed for the assignment is a limited level of assurance.
 
Scope
RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION has commissioned an independent verification by TUVR of reported CO2 equivalent 
emissions arising from their global activities, to establish conformance with the requirements of GHG Protocol within the scope 
of the verification as outlined below. Data and information supporting the CO2 equivalent assertion were historical in nature and 
proven by evidence. 
 
This engagement covers verification of emissions from anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gases included within the 
organization’s boundary and meets the requirements of GHG Protocol.
 
The organizational boundary was established following the operational control approach. 
 
Title or description of activities: Production, marketing, distribution and sales of clothing, footwear and accessories 
 
Location/boundary of the activities: Global operations. 
 
Physical infrastructure, activities, technologies, and processes of the organization: Offices, Distribution Centers and Stores.
 
Types of GHGs included (where applicable): CO2, N2O, CH4, HFCs, PFCs and SF6. 
 
Directed actions: none. 
 
GHG information for the following period was verified: 02/04/2023 – 30/03/2024. 
 
Intended user of the verification statement: general public. 
 
Objective 
The purposes of this verification exercise are, by review of objective evidence, to independently review: 
 
Whether the CO2 equivalent emissions are as declared within the organization’s CO2 equivalent assertion 
 
That the data reported are accurate, complete, consistent, transparent and free of material error or omission. 
 
Criteria 
Criteria against which the verification assessment is undertaken are the requirements of the GHG Protocol ‘A Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard (WRI/WBCSD)’ 
 
Materiality 
The materiality required of the verification was considered by TUVR to be below 10%, based on the needs of the intended user 
of the GHG Assertion

Conclusion
RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION provided the GHG assertion based on the requirements of GHG 
Protocol. The GHG information for the period 02/04/2023 – 30/03/2024 disclosing gross emissions of 
1 242 673 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent are verified by TUVR to a limited level of assurance, 
consistent with the agreed verification scope, objectives, and criteria. 
 
Scope 1: Direct GHG Emissions                                                                     14 679 tCO2e 
Scope 2: Indirect GHG Emissions from Imported Energy (market based)      22 362 tCO2e 
Scope 2: Indirect GHG Emissions from Imported Energy (location based)     58 601 tCO2e 
Scope 3: Indirect GHG emissions                                                               1 205 632 tCO2e 
Scope 3 Included the following categories: 
Emissions from: Cat 1 purchased goods and services, Cat 3 Fuel and Energy related activities, 
Cat 4 & 9 Upstream/Downstream transportation, Cat 5 Waste generated in operations, Cat 6 
Business Travel, Cat 7 Commuting, Cat 11 Use of sold products, Cat 12 EOL of sold products, 
Cat 14 Franchises 
 
Total gross emissions are based on Scope 2 market-based emissions.  
 
TUVR’s approach is risk-based, drawing on an understanding of the risks associated with modeling 
GHG emission information and the controls in place to mitigate these risks. Our examination 
included assessment, on a sample basis, of evidence relevant to the voluntary reporting of emission 
information. 
 
TUVR concludes with limited assurance that no evidence has been found that the presented CO2 
equivalent assertion is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of the CO2 equivalent 
data and information, and is prepared following the requirements of GHG Protocol. 
 
We planned and performed our work to obtain the information, explanations and evidence that we 
considered necessary to provide a limited level of assurance that the CO2 equivalent emissions for 
the period 02/04/2023 – 30/03/2024 are fairly stated with the following comments: 
 
 
The reasons for exclusion of customer transport in the Scope 3 - Cat 9, as well as any 
other exclusions and/or unreported Scope 3 categories, should be explained 
 
Documentation on inventory management must include base-year recalculation policy 
 
Internal control procedures should be enhanced to reduce sources of error in data 
collection and the calculation of associated emissions. 
  
This statement shall be interpreted with the CO2 equivalent assertion of Ralph Lauren Corporation as a whole.
Note: This Statement is issued, on behalf of RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION by T   ÜV Rheinland France. (“TUVR”) under 
its General Conditions for GHG Validation and Verification Services.The findings recorded hereon are based upon an audit 
performed by TUVR. A full copy of this statement and the supporting GHG Assertion is available on request from RALPH 
LAUREN CORPORATION. This Statement does not relieve RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION from compliance with any 
bylaws, federal, national or regional acts and regulations or with any guidelines issued pursuant to such regulations. 
Stipulations to the contrary are not binding on TUVR and TUVR shall have no responsibility to any parties other than its 
Client.
