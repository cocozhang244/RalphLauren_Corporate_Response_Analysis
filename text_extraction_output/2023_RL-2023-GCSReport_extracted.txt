A Message from Our Chairman and CEO
Dear All,
From the very beginning, Ralph Lauren’s Purpose has been to inspire the dream  
of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. For more than 50 years,  
this commitment has anchored our every action, starting with the creation of 
iconic products that our consumers will treasure for a lifetime and pass down 
through generations. 
Today, that commitment goes even further. We are challenging ourselves to 
lead the way in more deeply contributing to a better, more sustainable world 
in the ways we create products, value nature and champion the people and 
communities we touch. 
That’s why last year, we introduced the next chapter in our Citizenship and 
Sustainability journey, Timeless by Design. Our teams have made meaningful 
progress in the last year, including: 
•	 Supporting the circular economy with the introduction of our Cradle to 
Cradle (C2C) Certified® Gold Cashmere Sweater, the first of five Ralph 
Lauren iconic products that we’ve committed to have C2C Certified® 
by 2025; 
•	 Meeting our zero waste goal by diverting 92% of waste from landfill and 
incineration across our distribution centers;
•	 Achieving our goal to increase women in factory leadership by 25%, making 
progress on our path to parity in our supply chain;
•	 Furthering diversity in our organization by achieving our goal to ensure 
at least 20% of our Global Leadership Team is composed of racially and 
ethnically diverse talent;
•	 Deepening our brand storytelling to make our portrayal of the American 
dream inclusive of the diverse communities that inspire us; 
•	 Expanding our impact with equity-focused partnerships across  
the globe; and 
•	 Committing to a $25 million investment through The Ralph Lauren 
Corporate Foundation to expand or establish five cancer centers in 
underserved communities, including the recently opened Ralph Lauren 
Center for Cancer Prevention at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive 
Cancer Center in Washington, D.C. 
Thank you to the teams and partners whose leadership, dedication and creativity 
are represented by the work reflected in this report. Though there remains much 
more to do, we are proud of our progress and energized to take on the work 
ahead. This is the better life all of us want for ourselves, our families and friends all 
around the world. This is the dream of a better life made into a reality.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our Global Citizenship 
& Sustainability Approach 
This ethos of timelessness extends beyond our products to the lives, 
communities and natural resources our business intersects. Our Purpose 
is to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless 
style. Timeless by Design is how we are applying our Company’s Purpose 
to our approach to citizenship and sustainability. We live this commitment 
by empowering our employees, through the charitable work we undertake 
through our Company and The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation and 
with a continued focus on advancing a more circular apparel industry. From 
the materials we use to how we make our iconic products, we consider 
timeless style throughout our design process — ensuring our philosophy of 
timelessness is embedded from inspiration through to our products’ every 
use and reuse.
Our 2023 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report outlines progress on 
our goals and commitments — progress that is anchored in our Purpose 
and created with and for our people, communities and partners. But we 
know we must go further, and we can’t reach our goals alone because, at 
its core, Timeless by Design is about ensuring our business can meet the 
needs of all of our stakeholders now and into the future.
Timeless by Design 
Since our founding, we have 
believed in creating things 
that are timeless — that 
last and that never go out of 
style. Our iconic products 
are created to be worn,  
loved and passed on  
through generations.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Create with Intent 
Grounded in our enduring philosophy of timelessness, we are working to 
implement circular principles and instill cultural awareness practices into 
our design and development process. By designing with timelessness in 
mind from the start, we are enabling our products to live on responsibly 
and helping our consumers to love their items longer.
Protect Our Environment
By adopting practices that help preserve the world’s natural resources, we 
can be stewards in protecting our environment for generations to come. 
Beyond creating products more responsibly, we are working to operate in 
ways that respect our planet, such as transitioning to renewable energy, 
diverting waste from landfill and incineration, and efficiently managing 
water for our business and the communities where we operate.  
Champion Better Lives
Shaping a business that is timeless and has a positive impact on tomorrow 
means building relationships that stand the test of time and ensuring 
that everyone is included, respected and empowered. That’s why we’re 
committed to supporting our employees, our partners and those within our 
communities — working to build a brighter future.
Our Strategy
Timeless by Design is 
our global approach 
to citizenship and 
sustainability. With this 
as our North Star, we 
aim to reduce our overall 
environmental impact and 
champion the people and 
communities that intersect  
our business.

Our Circularity Approach 
Circularity is a systems-level approach to eliminating waste, recirculating 
materials and regenerating resources for a more sustainable economy.  
Our enduring philosophy of timelessness guides our overall approach  
to circularity.
Our circularity strategy has three main elements:
•	 Designing our products according to circular principles
•	 Connecting consumers to services that enable product longevity  
and reuse
•	 Investing in circular systems and innovation across the industry
Integrated Circularity
We are designing products 
with circularity in mind, 
connecting consumers to 
opportunities for repair and 
recirculation and investing 
in scalable innovation. 
These efforts support our 
commitment to timeless 
style, creating products that 
stand the test of time.
2030 GOAL

INTRODUCTION

Live On Promise 
In 2022, we introduced our Live On promise to take our enduring philosophy of timelessness even further with  
a new commitment:
By 2030, Ralph Lauren will enable our past and future products to live on responsibly. 
To deliver on this promise, we committed to designing new and reimagined products according to circular 
principles. To help extend the life of Ralph Lauren products — old and new — we are also enabling consumers 
to rent, repair and recirculate our items in select top cities. We also continue to make investments to help 
advance circular innovation across the industry. 
This year, we strengthened our commitment by bringing our first C2C Certified® product to market, initiating 
our circular principles workstream with internal and external partners and continuing our efforts to present 
vintage Ralph Lauren offerings to our consumers. 
Our POLO® MIRUM® sneaker and crossbody pouch are 
partially made from a 100% plastic-free material, created 
without relying on petrochemical and synthetic inputs.
By 2025, we will invest in scaling innovative 
technologies and regenerative practices to advance 
a circular economy.
​ADVANCE THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY
Our cashmere recycling program — implemented as 
part of the C2C certification process — connects 
consumers to a channel for recycling their end-of-use 
100% cashmere products.
We have been engaging in the resale market by 
selling curated collections of iconic, vintage Ralph 
Lauren products. These collections can be found on 
our digital platforms and in select stores.
By 2025, we will connect consumers with ways to 
rent, repair and recirculate our products in select  
top cities.
ENABLE CIRCULAR CONSUMER EXPERIENCES 
We reimagined our iconic luxury crewneck cashmere 
sweater to be our first Cradle to Cradle Certified® product.
We are developing products with increasingly higher 
recycled cotton content, including the New Denim 
Project capsule.
We are initiating our circular principles workstream with 
internal and external partners.

CIRCULARITY  
WORKING GROUP
Our Circularity Working Group, 
relaunched in 2022, works across 
the organization to integrate 
circularity in all segments of our 
products’ lifecycle. In the past year, 
the cross-functional team has 
focused on establishing a structure 
to facilitate collaboration within  
the organization and with our  
external partners.
Product Management — develops 
product with circular principles
Marketing — communicates the 
product story
Merchandising — selects what we 
develop to sell to our wholesale and 
retail partners
Sourcing — identifies, develops 
and secures certified sources of 
sustainable components
Business Innovation — develops 
circular business models 
Product Innovation — identifies and 
tests new solutions
Sustainability — determines the 
environmental impact 
Design — conceptualizes collections 
that integrate circular concepts into 
our brand heritage
Cradle to Cradle Certified® 
The Cradle to Cradle Product Innovation Institute’s C2C certification 
program is the global standard for products that are safe, circular and 
responsibly made. We chose the C2C standard because the assessment 
categories mirror our own sustainability goals and take a holistic approach 
to designing for circularity. To achieve C2C certification, a product or 
material is assessed across five categories of performance and can 
achieve levels ranging from Bronze to Platinum. Those categories include:
•	 Material health 
•	 Product circularity
•	 Clean air and climate protection
•	 Water and soil stewardship
•	 Social fairness
C2C CERTIFIED® GOLD CASHMERE SWEATER LAUNCH 
During the 2022 Global Fashion Summit in Copenhagen, we unveiled our C2C 
Certified® Gold Cashmere Sweater, an iconic product made to be worn, loved 
and live on responsibly for generations to come. Available in Men’s Purple 
Label and Women’s Collection brands, the first-of-its-kind luxury crewneck 
cashmere sweater is the first of five iconic Ralph Lauren products that we 
committed to have C2C Certified® by 2025. Every component of the sweater 
has been certified, from the cashmere fiber to its rich dyes and iconic label 
made with organic cotton. 
The C2C Certified® Gold Cashmere Sweater replaced the original iconic 
product, and our certified assortment will expand to include other cashmere 
products. We are also cascading our learnings from the certification process 
to inform the design and development of future products. At least one 
additional product will be submitted for certification in 2023.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Cashmere Recycling Program
Developed as part of the C2C certification process, we launched a 
recycling program for 100% cashmere in partnership with Re-Verso™, a 
leading textile production company that bridges science and technology to 
create a circular economy manufacturing system for high-quality wool and 
cashmere. The program, initially available in North America and Europe, 
allows consumers to request a prepaid mailing label from our website for 
their end-of-use cashmere product to be recycled. 
Network Partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) has a leading circular economy 
Network that brings together businesses, innovators, cities, universities and 
thought leaders to build a circular economy and scale solutions globally. 
Ralph Lauren has been a Network Partner since 2021. The Network has 
created a vision of a circular fashion economy where clothes are designed 
to be made from safe, recycled and/or renewable inputs, worn longer, and 
repurposed; one that works with the fashion industry to re-envision and 
redesign the way products are made and used. We participated in a number 
of the Network events and offerings in 2022 to further circularity efforts in 
our Company and the fashion industry, including:
Industry Workshops
In 2022, we participated in a fall workshop in Stockholm, Sweden, where we 
had the opportunity to work with EMF’s full Network of Partners to explore 
solutions to circular economy challenges across the entire value chain. 
Master Classes
Ralph Lauren staff members enrolled in a circular economy master class 
for the first time, provided through Exeter University. This educational 
opportunity aims to extend the knowledge of those familiar with circular 
principles to help enable action toward commercial benefits. 
The Jeans Redesign Project
We are also a participant of EMF’s Jeans Redesign Project, which consists 
of 100 brands, mills and manufacturers and aims to demonstrate how a 
garment can be designed and made for a circular economy. The Jeans 
Redesign Guidelines act as a blueprint and provide a starting point to 
design and manufacture products aligned with the principles of a circular 
economy. We are developing a 100% recycled denim product to meet or 
exceed The Jeans Redesign Guidelines for launch in 2023.
Through our participation in The Jeans Redesign and by using Circulytics, 
a company-level measuring tool developed by EMF, Ralph Lauren is taking 
a step forward in its long-term circular economy journey.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Digital Product ID
Digital Product IDs (DPIDs) will be crucial to enabling technology that 
supports a circular economy. A unique digital ID is placed in each item 
during production to provide data related to the garment’s origin and 
makeup when the product’s QR label is scanned. This process enables 
consumers and marketplaces to authenticate products directly with the 
brand owner and discourages the sale of counterfeit clothing in resale, 
protecting consumers, brands and marketplaces.
In 2019, Ralph Lauren began rolling out this technology across our portfolio, 
starting with the Polo brand. DPIDs are currently in more than 220 million 
Polo products and can be used to authenticate the products. 
RALPH LAUREN 
CIRCULARITY PRINCIPLES 
FOR DESIGN
A foundational element of reaching 
our circularity goals is the 
establishment of product design 
and development principles aligned 
to the core principles of circularity.  
We have engaged an expert partner 
to support us in establishing  
Ralph Lauren-specific principles  
in 2023. 
Increasing Product Authentication
Increasingly, consumers are seeking to align with brands whose value 
chains are ethical, environmental-friendly and reliable. New authentication 
and digital traceability tools can be leveraged to demonstrate or 
transparently share information with interested consumers. 
The World Economic Forum (WEF), Ralph Lauren, Vestiaire Collective 
and Global Innovator EVRYTHNG, in collaboration with Bain & Company, 
launched a pilot to ensure the authentication of fashion products in the 
secondhand market through digital ID technology. This pilot established 
a global collaboration between manufacturers and brand owners, 
suppliers, consumer representatives and regulators. It leverages new 
digital traceability and authentication technologies to drive circularity and 
sustainability, creating value for all stakeholders in the fashion value chain. 
As a second phase, Ralph Lauren and WEF, in partnership with technology 
providers, resellers and brands, have created a working group to create the 
standards and tools to bring this pilot to scale.
The first pilot of the new authentication platform has shown that 
companies like Ralph Lauren can have a direct connection to secondary-
market consumers while gaining insight into the lifespan of our clothes.

Ralph Lauren products are designed to be timeless and worn for 
generations. With this in mind, we choose our product materials 
thoughtfully to ensure high-quality and durability. Our sustainable 
materials strategy has a holistic orientation, inclusive of impacts across 
the environment, animal welfare, land use and farmer livelihoods. We look 
to source materials from certifications and programs that drive positive 
change in these areas. Our efforts and goals are focused on the key 
materials that make up 92.2% of our material use: cotton, wool, cashmere, 
leather, viscose and polyester.1 
In April 2023, we updated our Animal Welfare Policy to articulate our aims 
for all our animal-derived materials and reflect the latest science on the 
proper care of animals.
Enhanced traceability and transparency across our value chain is a critical 
enabler of our efforts to reduce the impact of our material use and support 
improved practices in material production, especially at the farm level. 
We are going beyond sourcing certified materials and are working towards 
increasing traceability of our supply chain. For more on our approach 
and progress around transparency and traceability, see the Responsible 
Sourcing section of this report.
Sustainable Materials
We seek to increase the 
use of more sustainable 
materials in our industry 
and are committed to 
using materials in ways 
that reduce environmental 
impact, protect biodiversity 
and animal welfare, support 
livelihoods and improve the 
traceability of raw materials. 
2025 GOALS
•	
Achieve 100% sustainably 
sourced key materials  
by 2025
•	
100% of our key wood 
suppliers for new Ralph 
Lauren store interiors will use 
sustainably sourced wood 
substrates (certified by a 
forest management system, 
repurposed or recycled)  
by 2025
TEXTILE EXCHANGE BRAND CERTIFICATION
Chain of custody standards are used by the fashion industry to 
validate the accuracy of claims about fiber content in a product. 
The recycled, organic and Responsible Animal Fiber standards 
owned by Textile Exchange require every member of the value chain 
to undergo a third-party audit to become certified to use these 
standards on customer-facing products. Ralph Lauren became 
a certified brand in 2023. Our first fully certified product will be 
Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) sweaters, available in our Fall ’23 
Polo collection.

Global Research and Development Studio
Our Global Research and Development Studio is a physical and virtual 
resource built on the principle that all materials and techniques should 
have a sustainability attribute. This central hub contributes to our  
progress on our sustainable materials goals by expanding our library  
of materials and processes available for adoption. Our 3D research and 
development program provides a tool for developing a product in 3D 
before creating a physical sample, helping to reduce material waste.  
We have expanded a robust 3D material and trim library for use in digital 
design and development.
89%
of our units produced met at least one 
of our sustainable material criteria in 
FY23 — up from 77% in FY22.
Natural Fiber Welding 
Beginning in FY22, we made an early investment in Natural Fiber Welding 
(NFW), whose groundbreaking technology is enabling us to reduce our 
use of synthetic materials. Last year, we launched the RLX CLARUS® 
Polo Shirt, made with the world’s first high-performance cotton fabric 
comprised of 50% recycled cotton. We continue to invest in NFW’s 
innovative materials to launch new products. In March 2023, we released 
the POLO® MIRUM® sneaker and crossbody pouch. MIRUM® is a 100% 
plastic-free material, created without relying on petrochemical and 
synthetic inputs.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Making Progress on Sustainable Cotton 
Cotton is the most widely used natural fiber for clothing production1 and 
accounts for more than 80% of our material use. We invest in the increased 
use of sustainable cotton and seek to support the scaling of improved 
practices in cotton cultivation, which benefits our business, the environment 
and the farmers that grow it. In FY23, 94% of the cotton units we produced 
met at least one of our defined sustainability attributes (organic, transitional/
in-conversion, Better Cotton, recycled, regenerative, U.S. Cotton Trust 
Protocol or Fair Trade). 
94%

In FY23,
U.S. COTTON TRUST PROTOCOL MEMBERSHIP
In FY23, building on the Company’s commitment to scale more 
sustainable farming practices and echoing The Ralph Lauren Corporate 
Foundation’s existing support of the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund 
(USRCF), Ralph Lauren Corporation became a member of the U.S. 
Cotton Trust Protocol (Trust Protocol). The Trust Protocol helps 
farmers transition to more sustainable cotton cultivation practices 
and enables growers to measure the environmental impacts of their 
operation to support continuous improvement. It is the only farm-level, 
science-based program that provides quantifiable, verifiable goals 
in six key sustainability metrics including land use, soil carbon, water 
management, soil loss, greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiency, 
as well as offers article-level supply chain transparency to all members. 
Our membership in the Trust Protocol is an important part of our efforts 
to build a more resilient cotton industry.
In 2022, the Trust Protocol was awarded funding for the U.S. Climate 
Smart Cotton Program as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
Partnership for Climate Smart Commodities pilot projects. The 
multistakeholder initiative includes the nonprofit Soil Health Institute, 
which The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation supports through the 
USRCF, as an implementing partner. This grant-funded pilot builds upon 
the four pillars of Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices allowing for 
improved soil health, increased drought and flood resilience, advanced 
nutrient efficiency, decreased soil erosion and reduced greenhouse gas 
emissions. It will provide technical and financial assistance to more than 
1,650 U.S. cotton farmers to support the adoption of CSA practices on 
more than one million acres over the next five years, scaling the impact 
and reach of the work initiated through the USRCF. 
For more information on the Trust Protocol, read their annual report; 
for more information on the USRCF, see the Community Engagement & 
Philanthropy section of this report.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Animal Welfare 
Our Animal Welfare Policy, which we updated in April 2023, outlines our 
commitment to the well-being and respectful treatment of animals, including 
our longstanding ban on the use of fur and our aim to have all of our animal-
derived materials certified to an animal welfare standard, where available. 
While only 5.4% of our total material use comes from animal-derived 
sources, we believe all animals should be treated with care and respect 
throughout all stages of life. We leverage animal fiber certification schemes 
to ensure alignment with this principle, as well as to help address some 
of the key environmental impacts associated with raising animals. We are 
demonstrating our commitment to animal welfare by prioritizing standards 
such as the Responsible Animal Fiber standards for wool and down and 
Sustainable Fibre Alliance for cashmere. Each of these standards has 
requirements in place for animal welfare at the farm level. 
Leather 
When we set our key materials goals in 2019, we built them with a strong 
ambition to map and trace our supply chains for these materials, including 
leather, and that ambition remains today. (See the Responsible Sourcing 
section of this report for more information on our traceability efforts.) The 
leather supply chain is long and complex, and one of its most significant 
challenges is the lack of transparency. It is also a shared supply chain 
across industries. While a number of animal welfare and land management 
standards exist for cattle, chain of custody infrastructure specific to the 
leather supply chain is limited and continues to be developed. We remain 
supportive of programs that aim to drive positive impact at the farm 
level while these advancements continue, such as the Leather Impact 
Accelerator (LIA). LIA is a set of tools developed by Textile Exchange 
focused on enabling leather supply chain members, from farmers to 
retailers, to contribute to a more responsible leather supply chain. These 
tools (individually) establish minimum social, environmental and animal 
welfare thresholds for practices at the farm and leather production 
levels and give recognition to producers who meet them. The tools also 
include cattle tracking requirements to lay the foundation for farm-to-
farm traceability early in the supply chain. In FY23 we invested in Impact 
Partnership Incentives, which are one of the LIA tools, for a second year. 
Wool
At the farm level, the Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) is used to certify 
that the Five Freedoms of animal welfare are protected, and progressive 
methods of land management are practiced on the farm. As wool moves 
through the supply chain, the RWS ensures a strong chain of custody is in 
place at every stage so the customer can be confident that the finished 
product contains wool that came from an RWS-certified farm.
IMPROVING 
SUSTAINABILITY OF  
KEY MATERIALS 
Cashmere — Our cashmere 
strategy focuses on sourcing 
Sustainable Fibre Alliance-certified 
virgin cashmere, or recycled 
cashmere, which typically comes 
from post-consumer recycled 
textiles or pre-consumer 
industrial waste.  
Down — We have sourced 100% 
Responsible Down Standard (RDS)-
certified virgin down since 2019. 
Viscose — We ask our suppliers to 
source viscose from manufacturers 
who have a Green Shirt audit score 
in Canopy’s Hot Button report and 
are exploring opportunities to use 
viscose that incorporates recycled 
material inputs.
Polyester — We continue to 
prioritize recycled polyester, and 
in the coming year the Global 
Research and Development  
team will focus on researching  
alternative feedstock options for 
recycled polyester.

& OVERVIEW
In FY23, we built upon our work with RWS-certified suppliers to develop 
products that meet all the requirements for labeling with the RWS logo. Our 
first RWS-certified Polo sweaters will be in stores in Fall ‘23 and designated 
with special hangtags.
Sustainable Store Interiors
Our store interiors reflect timelessness with natural materials that get 
better with age, such as wood and stone. Sustainability guidelines from 
the U.S. Green Building Council and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), 
among others, inform our interior materials sourcing. 
Our Forest Protection Policy outlines our commitment to protecting 
the world’s forests and guides selection of wood suppliers for our 
store interiors. Our goal is to have 100% of our key wood suppliers use 
sustainably sourced (certified by a forest management system, repurposed 
or recycled) wood substrates for new Ralph Lauren store interiors by 
2025. Nineteen suppliers committed to meeting the benchmark by the 
end of FY23, which represents 37% of our suppliers, compared to 11% in 
the previous year. In FY23, our key wood suppliers represented 99% of our 
business volume in this category. 
Our new retail store in the iconic Battersea Power Station in London was 
executed with FSC-certified wood flooring, and 80% of the freestanding 
floor fixtures and almost half of all artwork were repurposed pieces.
PROGRESS HIGHLIGHTS 
100%

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our Approach to Responsible Design
At Ralph Lauren, we have always been inspired by the beautiful, complex 
and interconnected elements that make up our world: its communities, 
histories, arts, crafts and — most of all — its people.
We are deepening our efforts to use the inspiration that captivates our 
imagination in a way that is culturally cognizant. We are on a journey to 
evolve our approach to a model built on collaboration, ensuring that our 
products and storytelling are inclusive of the unique and diverse cultures 
and people that inform and inspire us. In doing so, our products and the 
way we showcase them will have an even greater degree of authenticity 
and timelessness.
Design with Intent Steering Committee
In 2022, we created a new steering committee of senior cross-functional 
leaders to provide strategic oversight of our Design with Intent department 
and its workstreams. The committee collaborates across the organization 
to drive understanding of cultural sustainability, evolve our roadmap and 
best practices and open pathways to achieving our goals. The committee 
collaborates with Employee Impact Groups and creative directors to set 
our shared intent.
Responsible Design
For more than 50 years, 
our design ethos has been 
inspired by the world 
around us. As we evaluate 
and evolve our cultural 
inspiration, we know that 
it is important to involve 
authentic community voices 
in the products we design 
and the stories we tell. We 
take seriously our obligation 
to use the histories, arts, 
crafts and cultures that 
inspire our designs and 
storytelling in a way that  
is culturally responsible  
and sustainable.
ONGOING GOAL
•	
Ensure all of our design, 
production and merchant 
teams will receive annual 
training on sustainable, 
circular, inclusive and 
culturally cognizant design

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Building Cultural Cognizance
As we audit the sources of our design inspiration that are embedded 
in our brand codes, we are establishing short- and mid-term goals and 
priorities. These will serve our larger objective to build a holistic cultural 
sustainability framework that follows a product’s lifecycle, from concept 
design and sourcing to creation and go-to-market storytelling.
Our Cultural Awareness Council (the Council) enables progress by working 
cross-functionally to create and implement culturally sustainable policies, 
guidelines and best practices. The Council holds weekly review sessions 
with our design and concept teams, and weekly marketing and creative 
review sessions to support cultural sustainability across our product 
creation and marketing efforts. Employee Impact Group (EIG) leaders and 
external cultural and textile experts are consulted as needed to help inform 
our decision-making and our development of authentic partnerships, 
programs and storytelling. Specifically, our external Native American & 
Indigenous Advisory Council, which formally convenes annually, is a group 
of Indigenous leaders across cultural, historical, educational, legal, media 
and creative disciplines that review and provide guidance on the intentions 
and impacts of our Design with Intent work.
Our Cultural Awareness Guidelines support our approach. We update 
these annually according to emerging best practices and guidance from 
our network of external advisors and distribute them to all teams with a 
role in design, merchandising, advertising and marketing. We inform and 
prepare these teams to apply our guidelines through mandatory cultural 
awareness educational programs, including during new hire onboarding 
and in annual employee trainings.

Engagement with Native American and  
Indigenous Communities
For more than 50 years, we have drawn design and storytelling inspiration 
from the beautiful lands and individuals around us, and as we continue to 
evolve and grow, we believe it is important to more closely partner with the 
communities that inspire us. 
We recognize that we must honor the Indigenous communities that so 
richly contribute to American culture, and the cultures of many other 
countries. As a part of this work, we connect with Native American and 
Indigenous-focused organizations to apply greater cultural cognizance to 
our work and scale our impact in the communities we serve. 
Connecting with Indigenous Artisans 
In August 2022, a delegation of Cultural Awareness Council members 
attended the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA) annual 
art market in Santa Fe, New Mexico, to build on our understanding of 
Native perspectives and connect with Indigenous creatives and community 
leaders. The event showcases the work of more than 1,000 Native artists 
from more than 100 tribal communities in North America and Canada and 
generates nearly $160 million in revenue for the artists and the Santa Fe 
community each year1.
In November 2022, members of our Cultural Awareness Council attended 
Original to connect with artisans and to learn more about the beauty and 
legacy of traditional Mexican craftsmanship. This annual celebration of 
Indigenous Mexican culture and art in Mexico City, led by the Ministry of 
Culture of the Government of Mexico, publicly showcases the work of 
about 1,000 artisans from across Mexico, who represent nearly 5,000 
makers from the broader Mexican handicraft community.
Creative Futures Collective
We partner with Creative Futures Collective (CFC), an organization that 
empowers the next generation of creative leaders from disenfranchised or 
system-impacted communities, to provide an opportunity for mentorship, 
employment and exposure. We sponsored two CFC fellows to participate 
in SWAIA. Alongside mentorship support, we featured their journey in 
their own words and through their own lens via editorial stories on our 
consumer-facing RL Mag platform and our employee intranet. We are 
also exploring additional opportunities to engage with CFC on talent 
recruitment and development on an ongoing basis.

The Art of Indigenous Fashion
The Ralph Lauren Corporation is proud to support the Art of Indigenous 
Fashion exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Native Arts in Santa 
Fe, New Mexico. As a part of the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA), 
the museum took a curatorial approach to the exhibit to offer insights into 
the perspectives of Indigenous designers, beyond the visual and material 
qualities of their work.
Support for Native and Indigenous Education
As Education, Advocacy and Access is a key pillar of our philanthropic 
work across the Company and The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, we 
remain dedicated to providing next-generation leaders with opportunities 
to access education. The Company continues to support scholarship 
programs via the American Indian College Fund and launched a two-year 
Master of Fine Arts scholarship at IAIA, aiming to support Native and 
Indigenous talent in creative fields of work.
Artist in Residence Program
The Company’s Artists in Residence program invites artisans working 
with a variety of skill sets, mediums and materials to collaborate with 
Ralph Lauren’s design teams. This is intended to be a mutually beneficial 
exchange of resources, talent and trade techniques. During their tenure, we 
expect each Artist in Residence to have the opportunity to create a special 
product collaboration, melding the brilliance and unique skill of the artisan 
with our core brand sensibilities.
Our pilot program with the Polo brand is expected to launch in the coming 
year featuring traditional Indigenous design motifs created under a model 
of collaboration. We hope to use learnings from this pilot to inform and 
scale the program in the future. 
Because of our design-to-production timeline, we may have pre-designed, 
existing products already in our pipeline created prior to this evolved 
model. Any new product featuring Native American design motifs following 
our Summer 2023 season will be created under the evolved model. In line 
with our sustainability commitments, we will not be disposing of existing 
product. In this interim period, we are deepening our efforts to invest in 
communities of Native and Indigenous artisans.
Authentic Makers
In 2022, we were honored to work with Navajo artisan Jimmy Begay Jr. in 
partnership with Shiprock Santa Fe gallery for our first Authentic Maker 
program launch. His hand-crafted, stamped, heirloom-quality concho belts 
were made exclusively for the Ralph Lauren Collection. We showcased 
Jimmy’s craftsmanship and shared his story in our online RL Mag  
platform and via consumer-facing marketing channels.
OUR WORK WITH 
HISTORICALLY BLACK 
COLLEGES AND 
UNIVERSITIES
We have continued to expand our 
partnerships with historically Black 
colleges and universities (HBCUs).
In March 2022, we unveiled a 
limited-edition collection to honor 
the rich heritage and sartorial 
legacy of HBCUs through the lens 
of Morehouse College and Spelman 
College. The collection sought to 
share the history of both schools 
and build on our commitment 
to expand our portrayal of the 
American dream to include the 
nature of life at HBCUs, a story 
previously untold in depictions of 
Ralph Lauren’s collegiate sensibility. 
Conceptualized and designed by 
Morehouse and Spelman alumni at 
Ralph Lauren, the collection was 
supported by a campaign featuring 
an all-Black creative suite and cast 
comprised of students, faculty and 
alumni from both colleges. The 
collection sold out in two days, and 
we were proud to be recognized 
for the work with a Fast Company 
Brands that Matter award and 
a “Best Collaboration” award 
from The Impression. For more

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Building a Resilient and Responsible  
Supply Chain
Economic, social and environmental disruptions continued in FY23, and 
supply chain engagement remained a critical strategy to ensure greater 
resiliency and sustained commitments to responsible sourcing. Our work 
in supplier engagement aids our understanding of capacity, capability, and 
current and future performance potential. This work is vital to creating an 
agile supply chain ecosystem that can respond to disruption and change 
while meeting our shared and individual goals.
We continue to progress towards our goal to conduct 80% of our business 
with suppliers that meet the key and strategic supplier criteria which 
includes business, quality, citizenship and sustainability performance. 
In FY23, 50% of our business was with suppliers that meet the key and 
strategic supplier criteria. For more information on our procurement 
practices, refer to our Supply Chain Sustainability Policy.
Continuous Supplier Engagement and Partnership
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) continues to focus on 
strengthening performance in three key areas: business execution and 
partnership, citizenship and sustainability, and quality. 
We communicate our expectations and seek feedback on how to continue 
being a responsible partner via the following strategies: one-on-one 
check-ins, semi-annual supplier summits, roundtable discussions, surveys 
(including the Better Buying Institute Survey) and our Vendor Scorecard. In 
FY24, we will expand the use of our Scorecard to Tier 2 suppliers.
Our Vendor Scorecard has social and environmental performance 
indicators that enable us to communicate our sustainability expectations, 
evaluate and monitor the progress of our suppliers and strengthen 
collaboration on continuous improvement. In FY23, we increased the use 
of industry tools for our supplier scorecard, including the Higg Facility 
Environment Module (FEM) and Social Labor Convergence Project 
(SLCP), as well as the tracking of sustainable material certifications and 
resource-efficient production practices to ensure alignment between our 
sourcing strategy and our GC&S goals. 
We collected Higg FEM data from 270 Tier 1 facilities, representing 90% of 
our supply chain spend. Among the reporting facilities, 255 facilities (89.7% 
of business spend) have completed data verification by an SAC-approved 
verifier, an increase from 87% last year. Facilities scored an average of 53 
Responsible Sourcing
To build a resilient and 
responsible supply chain, we 
are continuing to deepen our 
understanding across our 
full value chain, strengthen

Supplier Summits 
Supplier Summits are important connection points where we bring 
suppliers together with our teams to engage in two-way dialogue on 
improving our partnership. It also gives us the opportunity to share 
important updates and performance trends we are seeing in certain 
countries or areas. Throughout the year, we hosted roundtables and 
trainings globally to share updates to our compliance programming and 
Global Citizenship & Sustainability (GC&S) standards. Additionally, in  
FY23 we were thrilled to return to in-person summits in India and 
Bangladesh with our suppliers. In a follow-up session in India dedicated 
to Worker Well-being, we focused on our core initiatives in compliance 
monitoring, wage management and women’s empowerment, which included 
a brainstorm and feedback session on how to attract and retain talented 
workers. For additional details on our diversity, equity and inclusion and 
women in leadership roundtables, please see Rights and Empowerment in

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Owning Our Impact: Our Approach to 
Responsible Purchasing Practices 
Our supplier partnerships are a two-way street. We are addressing the role 
we play in supporting more responsible manufacturing by continuing our 
commitment to responsible purchasing practices. In particular, we leverage 
the Better Buying Institute Survey, which helps us further understand 
the impact of our business on factories and on workers. This feedback 
helps to uphold accountability in our supplier partnerships and creates 
a productive forum for developing solutions together. We have created 
cross-functional working groups to address our key areas of opportunity. 
Through the working groups, we have progressively built a transformation 
plan, integrating feedback from the survey and creating tangible goals for 
progress. We also continue to conduct mandatory training programs on 
these practices for our buying and sourcing teams. 
Transparency and Traceability
Enhancing transparency and traceability across our value chain is 
foundational to the successful implementation of our GC&S strategy 
and achievement of our goals. It enables us to better understand our 
impacts, drive targeted action and investment and track our progress more 
accurately. This year we took significant steps to increase supply chain 
visibility and create approaches to chain of custody verification to enhance 
our traceability efforts. We are committed to improving both transparency 
into global supply chains and the traceability of our products across Ralph 
Lauren-specific value chains.
Transparency: Deepening our Understanding of Actors  
in the Value Chain
Building on our effort to map and disclose our supplier partners, we 
continued to use Open Supply Hub (formerly Open Apparel Registry) to 
publish the name, location and parent company of Tier 1 value-adding 
processing units including washing, embroidery and printing facilities.  
The list is updated regularly and was last updated on April 3, 2023.
In FY23, we worked with 408 active Tier 1 factories across 30 countries, 
covering 95% of our business across all categories. In addition to finished 
goods factories, we continued to disclose Tier 1 processing units. We had 
183 active processing units for Finished Goods factories. Overall, FY23 
disclosures included 88% of factory coverage.
HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR 
BETTER BUYING 
INSTITUTE SURVEY 
72% of suppliers (on par with 
industry average) see Ralph Lauren 
as a partner in business growth. 
The suppliers who joined the survey 
cover 78% of value and 73% of unit 
volume in the business.
Based on our suppliers’ feedback, 
we will continue to focus on planning 
and forecasting, sourcing and 
order management, and win-win 
sustainable partnership.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
In FY23, we also ran a pilot with Sourcemap, which invites suppliers to 
engage in and cascade surveys deeper into the supply chain to uncover 
detailed supplier connections as well as production capabilities, labor 
conditions and environmental performance. Learnings from this work are 
informing future development of our vendor management systems, our 
approach to identifying supply risks and opportunities, and our ability 
to increase engagement on sustainability and citizenship performance. 
Please see the Climate section for more information about how we are 
engaging with Tier 2 mills on decarbonization, as an example.
Traceability: Verifying Connections Across the Value Chain
Tracking products and their inputs across the value chain from source to 
shelf has become mandatory for some commodities and is emerging as a 
regulatory requirement globally. This is possible through digital traceability 
(e.g. chain of custody) and physical traceability (e.g. trackers). It also 
supports our efforts to achieve 100% sustainably sourced key materials 
(as described in the Sustainable Materials section of this report). In 
FY23, we rolled out a Traceability Playbook to suppliers to communicate 
our expectations around chain of custody documentation and to provide 
support and training on this topic. We also conducted several pilots to test 
technologies to support our traceability efforts.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
TEXTILE GENESIS
Ralph Lauren engaged in pilots with 
the traceability platform Textile 
Genesis to better understand 
the potential to leverage this 
kind of technology in our value 
chain. Textile Genesis is a digital 
platform that enables users to trace 
materials from source to finished 
goods using digital-tokens-based 
traceability. Our focus for the pilots 
was recycled polyester validation 
using Textile Exchange’s Global 
Recycled Standard, and U.S. cotton 
tracked through the Trust Protocol’s 
proprietary platform.
From these pilots, we gleaned 
valuable lessons in the following 
areas: supplier onboarding 
processes, use cases for transaction 
mapping and documentation 
verification capabilities for 
sustainable materials, all of which 
are being leveraged as we continue 
to partner across our value chain  
to advance transparency  
and traceability.
Fibretrace 
Our pilot with Fibretrace leveraged the company’s tracker technology 
to create key chain of custody links across portions of the supply chain 
for our Origin Polo®, introduced in February 2023. The product is made 
from cotton grown by farmers transitioning to more sustainable practices, 
including the use of bio-based agricultural inputs. In FY24, we intend to 
explore other chain of custody tracker technologies as well.
Oritain
One of the main focus areas for our industry is creating visibility into the 
country of origin for key materials, such as cotton. This year, we extended 
our partnership with Oritain to provide country of origin verification testing 
on select fabrics and products. These tests provide an added layer of 
confirmation to our traceability documentation efforts. 
Looking Ahead
Expectations for greater transparency and traceability in supply chains 
and products are increasing from regulators and consumers alike. 
Developing this visibility requires a new way of operating that presents 
challenges for our entire industry but also unlocks opportunities for us to 
drive positive impact and increase resilience and agility across our value 
chain. We are working towards establishing a comprehensive long-term 
Transparency & Traceability strategy and approach, incorporating the 
lessons learned from our piloting efforts thus far. A key component of this 
work will include leveraging technology in an accessible way that reflects 
the diversity across our value chain and enables us to make progress in 
this critical area.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
A Target for Net Zero
Our commitment to lowering our emissions is aligned with the urgency 
required to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C in accordance with the 
goal of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
The Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) has developed standards for 
translating this urgency into corporate targets. We have received SBTi 
approval for our 2030 GHG reduction target and have submitted our net 
zero target for SBTi approval against their Net-Zero Standard. 
Our Climate Strategy
As we develop and refine our roadmap to achieving net zero by 2040, we 
have defined key strategies for reducing GHG emissions across our own 
operations and supply chain. To implement these strategies, we establish 
partnerships and engage on policy issues to accelerate low carbon 
practices in our industry. Our Net Zero Commitment Statement further 
details how we will achieve these targets.
Climate
We are in a climate crisis, 
one that requires us all to 
make significant reductions 
to global greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions so we 
can protect and preserve 
our planet. That is why we 
have created an ambitious 
roadmap with bold near-

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
We work to address GHG emissions in both our own operations — over 
which we have the most direct control — and in our supply chain, which 
contributes to the majority of our emissions. We also participate in industry 
collaborations including United Nations Fashion Industry Charter for 
Climate Action, the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, G7 Fashion Pact, Clean 
Energy Buyers Alliance and RE100, among others. These collaborations 
help to bring together expertise to inform targeted corporate actions for 
decarbonization, including the transition to renewable energy across our 
supply chains and growing the circular economy.

Emissions Progress 
Our absolute emissions decreased by 29% in FY23 from our FY20 
baseline. This reduction is driven by production volumes decreasing by 
33% compared to FY20, which contributed significantly to our Scope 
3 emissions from manufacturing and raw materials. Other factors that 
contribute to this change in emissions include: reductions in air freight 
usage from FY22 levels; a shift in business travel practices; and regular 
improvements to our carbon footprint methodology consistent with 
carbon accounting best practices. Specifically, we have made significant 
improvements around how we collect more comprehensive data from 
suppliers to better reflect our manufacturing practices in our supply chain.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Renewable Energy in Our Operations
In recent years, increased demand for renewable energy and disruptions in 
the supply chain have led to sourcing challenges in the renewable energy 
marketplace. As we continue to pursue projects that will help us meet our 
2025 renewable energy target and bring additional renewable electricity 
to the grid, we have navigated these challenges by working closely with 
renewable energy developers, expanding our sourcing to additional grid 
regions, and evaluating alternative contract and financing arrangements.
In FY23, we made progress sourcing virtual power purchase agreements 
(VPPAs) for our electricity consumption in North America and Europe. 
•	 In North America, we are pursuing multiple projects that will result in 
new solar electricity generation in the grid and will collectively match 
the electricity we consume annually in the United States and Canada.
•	 In Europe, we are participating in the Fashion Pact’s collective virtual 
power purchase agreement (CVPPA) initiative. We are partnering with 
11 other fashion companies to aggregate our electricity demand in 
Europe and sign a long-term agreement adding new renewable energy 
capacity to the grid. We anticipate that this agreement will match 
most of the electricity we consume annually in Europe.
LED Lighting in our Distribution Centers
We are in the process of switching all the lighting equipment in our two 
largest North Carolina distribution center facilities from fluorescent to 
energy efficient LED lighting. When completed in FY24, the new lighting 
will decrease our annual electricity use in these facilities by 70% and avoid 
6,300 lbs of fluorescent light waste each year.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Addressing Emissions in Our Supply Chain 
A significant portion of our emissions comes from our supply chain, so we 
work with suppliers to set and implement goals and plans to reduce their 
carbon footprint.
The Carbon Leadership Program
In FY23, we continued our partnership with the Apparel Impact Institute 
to roll out the Carbon Leadership Program within our supply chain. We 
refreshed our supply chain carbon emissions analysis to incorporate the 
emissions reduction targets and roadmaps developed in collaboration 
with our suppliers in the first cohort in FY22. We also continued to identify 
priority facilities and develop decarbonization roadmaps for each. 
Through the Program, we invested in expert technical support for each 
manufacturing facility to develop their 2025 and 2030 carbon and water 
reduction plans in alignment with broader industry ambitions and best 
practices. We also worked closely with our suppliers to track progress and 
support capability building and collective action programs. We plan to 
continue expanding the program in our supply chain.
Accelerating Coal Elimination in our Supply Chain
Coal is one of the most carbon intensive energy sources in the 
manufacturing industry and therefore a crucial factor in our supply chain 
decarbonization pathway. We aim to eliminate the use of coal in our supply 
chain as soon as possible. In FY23, we launched our accelerated roadmap 
to eliminate coal in our supply chain:
•	 Beginning in November 2022, we no longer onboarded new 
manufacturing facilities with on-site coal usage.
•	 As of December 2022, existing suppliers and facilities with known 
on-site coal consumption were required to submit a concrete 
commitment to eliminate coal usage by 2025.
Coal-attributed emissions represent an estimated 31% of our 
manufacturing carbon footprint. In FY23, we analyzed the usage of coal 
in our supply base, making use of the data collected through the third-
party-verified Higg Index Facility Environmental Module as well as our 
internal platform. As of March 2023, we identified 61 active Tier 1, Tier 2 
and sub-contracted facilities that have on-site coal usage. So far, 50 have 
committed to eliminate their coal usage by 2025. We continue to engage 
with our partners to monitor their progress. 
CARBON LEADERSHIP 
PROGRAM PROGRESS
We expanded our roll out of the 
Carbon Leadership Program to 
cover 48 facilities, representing 
approximately 47% of our raw 
material business spend, and 19 
strategic finished goods facilities.
Nominated facilities set carbon 
reduction targets between 14% and 
80% by 2030 against their 2019 
baseline. The average reduction 
targets committed by all the 
nominated facilities so far is 59%. 
Based on the roadmaps developed 
by the nominated facilities, an 
aggregated savings estimation of  
1,792,905 tons of CO2 equivalent 
annually has been identified. 
SUPPLIER 
DECARBONIZATION 
Roadmaps developed under the 
Carbon Leadership Program are

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
As a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action (FICCA), 
we are working to identify opportunities to accelerate the elimination 
of coal across our industry. We continue to monitor the evolving 
infrastructure and policy developments in our sourcing geographies,  
while collaborating closely with our peers and partners in the industry  
to drive action on coal elimination in our shared supply chains.
Integrated Circularity and Sustainable Materials 
Our ongoing commitments to create timeless, circular products and to 
use materials with reduced environmental impact are critical to reducing 
emissions in our value chain. Progress toward our targets (offering high-
quality products made with 100% recycled cotton and increasing the share 
of sustainably-sourced key materials) will contribute to reductions in our 
Scope 3 footprint. For more information, see the Integrated Circularity 
and Sustainable Materials sections of this report.
Transportation and Distribution 
Our Scope 3 footprint includes emissions from product transport such 
as train, ocean, air and truck freight. To mitigate cost and environmental 
impact, we prioritize efficiency when choosing how to transport products 
to our distribution centers. We only allow vendors to deliver products by 
air in rare circumstances, such as when production does not meet delivery 
deadlines and there is a risk to keeping our promise to our customers.  
Our logistics provider selection process continues to include and consider 
candidates’ sustainability practices — from the presence of existing 
company sustainability strategy to working with some parcel carriers to 
develop performance measurement and continuous improvement plans. 
We are also signatories to the Ocean Conservancy’s Arctic Corporate 
Shipping Pledge, committing us to not hire carriers to ship our products 
through Arctic Trans-Shipment Routes.
In FY23, air freight managed directly by Ralph Lauren was 7.6% compared 
with 14.5% in FY22. This decrease was due to ongoing improvements in 
our buying practices and a decrease in time constraints linked to factory 
closures, ocean shipping congestion and pandemic-related port delays. 
In FY23, vendor-managed air accounted for 3.8% of total shipments, 
compared with 6.3% in FY22.
CLIMATE RISK 
We consider climate as part of 
enterprise risk management and 
business planning. In FY23, we 
conducted a preliminary scenario 
analysis for physical climate risk 
and climate policy risk. A cross-
functional Climate Risk Task 
Force meets semi-annually to 
identify and describe key climate 
risks, communicate them to key 
stakeholders ­— including our 
leadership team and our Board of 
Directors — and ensure prevention 
and mitigation actions are taken. We 
align our climate risk disclosures 
with the recommendations of the 
Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Read

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our Water Stewardship Approach 
Water is critical for communities and ecosystems to thrive and is also an 
essential resource for our business. Our industry depends on water, from 
irrigation for fiber crop cultivation to dyeing and washing processes in 
manufacturing to management of our owned and operated facilities. As 
a result, we look to conserve water in our operations, protect its sources, 
responsibly manage wastewater and help improve community access to 
this fundamental resource.
Water Stewardship
We are committed to 
reducing water consumption 
across our value chain, and 
safeguarding and improving 
access to water resources in 
our communities.

2025 GOAL
Water Stewardship in Our Supply Chain
In FY23, we began working with a third-party expert to analyze water 
hotspots in our supply chain and identify priority areas for improving water 
use practices in manufacturing and production. In parallel, we continued 
our direct collaboration with suppliers to improve water management 
through the adoption of more water-efficient processing for our materials 
and product manufacturing. In FY23, these transitions helped our suppliers 
avoid over 240,000 cubic meters of water use. Furthermore, we continued 
to expand our support to help our partners set facility-level water 
reduction targets through the Carbon Leadership Program. Through the 
program, nominated facilities set 2025 and 2030 water reduction targets 
ranging up to 100%. Based on the roadmaps developed by the nominated 
facilities, an aggregated saving estimation of 17 million cubic meters of 
water annually has been identified.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Improving Watershed Health
Addressing water challenges across our value chain goes beyond water 
use in manufacturing, which is why our approach to water stewardship 
includes engaging in joint efforts to improve water management at scale. 
Through our ongoing partnership with World Wildlife Fund (WWF), we 
have conducted a comprehensive water risk analysis, enabling us to 
identify water-stressed basins in our supply chain and prioritize action and 
investment to improve watershed health in those locations.
In FY23, we continued our participation in WWF’s Noyyal-Bhavani 
Collective Action Program. This program is focused on ensuring that, by 
2030, the Noyyal and Bhavani sub-basins of the Cauvery River in Southern 
India are healthy ecosystems that ensure water security for people 
and nature. In addition to addressing regional textile industry impacts 
on freshwater, the program also focuses on improving farming water 
management practices, protecting freshwater biodiversity and clearing of 
invasive species that harm water systems.
In 2022, 13 textile wet processing facilities joined the program and were 
evaluated for potential water management improvement opportunities 
and provided with recommendation plans. Through the implementation of 
these improvement opportunities, the 13 sites saved a total of more than 
114,330 cubic meters of water in 2022. 
Supporting Water Access
Safe drinking water is the most primary of human needs, yet worldwide, one 
in three people do not have access to this vital resource. To help end this 
disparity, we support organizations providing clean water for those in need. 
Since 2018, the Company has been working with GiveMeTap to provide 
drinking water sources in rural communities in the Upper West Region of 
Ghana. In 2023, we funded nine water pumps for a total of 43 pumps, which 
will improve safe water access to approximately 43,000 people since our 
partnership began. We are also proud to expand our goal to fund 100 pumps 
by 2026.
The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation has also made several 
commitments to improve access to clean water around the world, as well as 
sanitation and hygiene. More information on the Foundation and Company 
efforts can be found in the Community Engagement & Philanthropy section 
of this report.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our Waste Management Approach
Part of conserving natural resources is managing waste in a responsible 
way. We work to minimize waste in our operations and divert waste 
from landfill and incineration to donation, reuse and recycling. Our goal 
is continued improvement as we incorporate zero waste principles 
throughout our business practices. 
In Our Distribution Centers
We are proud to have diverted 92% of waste from landfill and 
incineration across our distribution centers, meeting the Zero Waste 
International Alliance definition of zero waste1. Many efforts contributed 
to this milestone, including the FY23 installation of balers at two of our 
distribution centers to increase plastic recycling and the addition and 
expansion of partnerships with textile recyclers. We will continue to 
maintain this minimum diversion level and seek ongoing improvements in 
waste diversion and reduction at all facilities.
In Corporate Offices
We are continually working to identify actions we can take in our corporate 
offices that contribute to waste reduction and diversion. For example, 
we have an ongoing partnership with FABSCRAP to recycle and reuse 
sample fabric, leading to more than 12,000 pounds of fabric diverted from 
landfill in 2022. In the last year, we discontinued use of individual product 
polybags for sales and design samples in the U.S. and Asia Pacific regions 
and are exploring options to expand this practice to Europe in FY24. Also 
in FY23, we introduced organic waste collection for composting at our 
corporate headquarters in New York City.
In Manufacturing 
In 2022, we partnered with Queen of Raw, a global textile marketplace, to 
address fabric waste in production in two key sourcing countries: China 
and Vietnam. Working with our suppliers and Queen of Raw’s global 
network of recyclers, we were able to divert 11.8 metric tons of unused 
materials from landfill. We are exploring options to further expand this 
initiative to other countries in FY24.
Waste Management
We are committed to 
reducing waste at its source 
and diverting waste from 
landfill through recycling  
and reuse.
2025 GOAL
•	
Achieve 100% recyclable, 
reusable or sustainably 
sourced packaging materials.
2023 GOAL 
•	
Achieve zero waste to  
landfill across our  
distribution centers.1
1 Using the Zero Waste International Alliance definition of zero waste, we will divert more than 90% of the waste generated at our distribution centers from landfill and incineration.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
In Our Packaging
We consider packaging a component of the product and, as with all 
our products, we are working toward using materials that reduce 
environmental impact and minimize waste. In FY23, we were able to make 
significant progress toward our goal of packaging material sustainability 
with a full transition to polybags with 100% recycled content from all 
key suppliers. We also began pilot testing paper-based alternatives to 
polybags and polymailers for initial adoption in North American Polo Outlet 
Stores and e-commerce, respectively. 73% of our total packaging volume 
met at least one of our sustainable packaging criteria in the fiscal year. 
On RalphLauren.com, we offer a reduced packaging option that gives 
consumers the ability to remove plastic or paper inserts, hangers, garment 
bags, promotional materials and paper invoices from their orders. In FY23, 
we continued to remove and recycle all of the polybags from reduced 
packaging orders, which represented approximately 9% of all orders 
placed in North America through RalphLauren.com. 
Managing Excess Inventory
Since being introduced in 2020, we have continued to use our Excess 
Inventory Management Principles to guide our approach for limiting excess 
inventory and maximizing waste diversion. 
In FY23, we launched our Fabric First Initiative, decreasing lead times 
in production and allowing us to keep our orders as close as possible to 
market demand. We also continued to prevent excess by decreasing the 
amount of product purchased specifically for sale at Polo Outlet Stores 
and increasing the amount of product originally offered through other 
channels (e.g., wholesale) for sale at Polo Outlet Stores. 
We are committed to identifying and applying sustainable options 
for managing excess and damaged product. In the past year, we have 
continued to increase diversion of excess inventory with new and 
expanded recycling and donation partnerships globally.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our Chemical Management Approach
We take responsibility for ensuring that the chemicals used to make 
our products are safe for people and the environment. Our Sustainable 
Chemical Management Policy outlines our approach to assessing the 
impacts of the chemicals in our supply chain and partnering with our 
manufacturers on responsible chemical management practices.
Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals Programme 
Ralph Lauren is a partner in the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals 
(ZDHC) Programme, a cross-sector coalition aimed at advancing the 
industry toward zero discharge of hazardous chemicals. Through this 
partnership, we collaborate with peers and experts to eliminate the use 
and discharge of these chemicals across our apparel supply chain. We 
adopt the ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) and 
ZDHC-approved Chemical Inventory List Management Tools to enable our 
suppliers to track and report on all chemicals used in the creation of our 
products, and prioritize the substitution of harmful chemicals with MRSL-
conformant, safer alternatives.
The industry’s collective work in sustainable chemicals management — 
as well as the MRSL — continue to evolve as new materials, safer and 
more sustainable alternatives, chemical testing, tools and technologies 
continue to develop over time. We are advancing toward the full elimination 
of hazardous chemicals in our global supply chain, and we are committed 
to continuing to do so as our industry evolves. In FY23, we continued to 
expand our visibility into chemical products used in our manufacturing 
supply chain, as well as their conformance status with the MRSL, 
specifically in Tier 1 manufacturing facilities that represent 79% of our 
business spend, compared to 72% last year. Of the chemicals reported, 
84% conform with the MRSL. In our Tier 2 supply chain, we have chemical 
visibility on 52% of our woven, knit and sweater material business spend. 
Additionally, 86% of the chemicals reported conform with the MRSL. We 
are working closely with suppliers to achieve full MRSL conformance by 
2025 and beyond.
In addition to the chemical transparency and MRSL conformance, we 
continued to assess the operational aspect of chemical management  
at the facility level through the Chemical Management section in the  
Higg Index Facility Environmental Module (FEM). Our Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers 
and subcontracted facilities scored an average 31, 39 and 31 points in the 
Chemical Management section, respectively.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Aligned with the ZDHC approach to confirm that MRSL substances are not 
intentionally used, we require manufacturing facilities with wet processing 
to test their wastewater output against the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines 
and share results on the ZDHC Gateway portal. Among our facilities, 66% 
of Tier 1 and 56% of Tier 2 (by business spend) have performed wastewater 
tests in accordance with the Guidelines; of these 83% comply with the 
ZDHC requirement, with 99.8% of the substances screened compliant with 
the ZDHC standard. 
Chemical Verification
In FY23, we continued to work closely with multiple ZDHC-approved 
chemical inventory list management tool providers to increase the 
adoption of disclosure tools and to ensure that data quality and accuracy 
are high. We are also exploring an industry-aligned methodology to  
validate the chemical data reported from our suppliers’ manufacturing 
sites. In FY24, we plan to pilot test the methodology with our top wet 
processors globally.
Elimination of Priority Chemicals
For the last few years, we have focused on eliminating priority, harmful 
chemicals. We successfully transitioned all our water repellent fabrics 
to non-PFAS materials in FY23. Also, we no longer develop materials or 
products with intentionally added PFAS or PVC materials. Additionally, 
PFAS has been incorporated into our product testing manual to ensure 
product compliance with the MRSL standard. We are on track to phase out 
all Potassium Permanganate from denim by 2025, and plan to expand this  
to non-denim products.
Alternative Washes 
We are building on the progress on our denim washes with other woven 
and knit products where it is challenging to get an authentic vintage look 
without the use of the chemicals we seek to eliminate. Our teams are 
working collaboratively to identify alternative washes that are suitable for 
our other woven and knit materials, while maintaining our quality standards 
and desired aesthetic. We are also dependent upon the scaled availability 
of safer alternative chemicals that are suitable for other woven and knit 
applications. As such, we continue to support engagements with chemical  
providers through the ZDHC to raise awareness on the demands for  
safer alternatives.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Protecting Biodiversity
Nature provides people and businesses like ours with critical resources 
such as freshwater, food and essential raw materials. The dual crises 
of climate change and biodiversity loss are closely intertwined. As 
ecosystems and species are increasingly threatened, Ralph Lauren is 
committed to leveraging science to build an in-depth understanding of our 
current impacts on biodiversity by:
•	 Identifying ways to avoid new negative impacts and reduce existing 
ones where possible
•	 Developing strategies to restore and regenerate ecosystems in our 
value chain
•	 Identifying opportunities to engage in transformative, systems-level 
efforts to address drivers of nature loss
On our path to setting goals in alignment with the Science Based Targets 
for Nature, we have established initiatives that address many aspects of 
the target areas identified in the initial guidance. We are actively engaging 
with The Fashion Pact’s biodiversity pillar, which is focused on supporting 
members with developing biodiversity strategies aligned with the Science 
Based Targets for Nature and identifying pathways for reducing nature 
impacts of key materials such as leather and cashmere.
Biodiversity
Biodiversity is essential 
for the health of people, 
the environment and the 
economy. We work to reduce 
our impact on nature and 
protect and restore the 
ecosystems our supply chain 
relies on.
2024 GOAL
•	
Develop a biodiversity 
strategy and set goals aligned 
with the Science Based 
Targets for Nature by 2024
Supporting Nature-Related Transparency
We believe transparency is an important aspect of addressing biodiversity 
loss at a global scale and recognize the role that business must play 
to mitigate negative impacts on nature. That is why, ahead of the UN 
Biodiversity Conference in Montreal in December 2022, Ralph Lauren 
joined more than 400 business and finance institutions in signing onto the 
#MakeItMandatory campaign. The campaign urged heads of state to adopt 
a requirement for large businesses and financial institutions to assess and 
disclose their risks, impacts and dependencies on biodiversity by 2030 as 
part of the Global Biodiversity Framework.

Combating Deforestation
Deforestation and land conversion are key drivers of biodiversity and 
habitat loss. For the second year, we invested in Impact Partnership 
Incentives (through Textile Exchange), which directly supports Produzindo 
Certo, an on-the-ground organization working with cattle farms in Brazil. 
It seeks to improve their practices to achieve animal welfare certification 
and have their farms third-party verified as Deforestation/Conversion-Free 
within three years. We have also continued our engagement in the Leather 
Working Group’s deforestation working group.
Advancing Our Strategy 
We have engaged Quantis, a leading environmental sustainability 
consultancy, to conduct a formal assessment of our nature-related 
impacts and dependencies, to inform development of a comprehensive 
biodiversity strategy in FY24. As part of this process, we will map our 
current sustainability goals and initiatives against these impact and 
dependency areas and prepare for disclosure informed by the Task Force 
for Nature-Related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) framework, which is 
expected to be released in 2023.

As we deepen our collegiate partnerships, we have incorporated baseline 
criteria to only engage with partners that align with our Company values, 
beliefs and business objectives. In 2022, we expanded our relationships 
and recruitment efforts with historically Black colleges and universities 
(HBCUs) from two to twelve schools. Through HBCU partnerships, we 
invest in scholarships, mentorship and development opportunities and 
offer career acceleration programs for diverse and system-impacted 
talent. For more information on our HBCU scholarships, see the 
Community Engagement & Philanthropy section of this report. 
In 2022, we joined the New York Jobs CEO Council, a coalition of 
employers focused on providing access to high-potential jobs for 
low-income New Yorkers and those within Black, Hispanic/Latinx and 
Asian communities, including students from the City University of New 
York (CUNY) system. Through this coalition, we have deepened our 
relationship with CUNY schools and provided their students access to 
our early career opportunities.
We remain dedicated to supporting diverse early career talent at Ralph 
Lauren, increasing our internship and mentorship program capacities to 
ensure our shared ambition for their growth and development.
Stephen Lawrence Day Foundation Career Day 
In 2022, we increased our engagement with the Stephen Lawrence 
Day Foundation, an organization that aims to inspire a more equal, 
inclusive society and to foster opportunities for marginalized young 
people in the U.K. In our efforts to recruit and develop a diverse array 
of early talent, we participated in their career day event in November 
2022, offering ambitious, U.K.-based young talent a venue to network 
with representatives from throughout Ralph Lauren, participate in 
follow-up mentoring sessions and be among the first to know about 
open roles at the Company relevant to their interests. Learn more about 
our partnership with the Stephen Lawrence Day Foundation in the 
Community Engagement & Philanthropy section of this report.
The diversity of our 
workforce is integral 
to building a strong, 
successful organization. 
With this in mind, we 
develop programs and 
partnerships within 
and outside of our 
Company to engage 
and develop talent with 
diverse backgrounds, 
experiences and 
perspectives.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
UK Black Business Week
Connecting with external organizations and events that champion 
DE&I supports our efforts to recruit diverse talent beyond entry 
levels. In October 2022, Ralph Lauren sponsored U.K. Black Business 
Week, an event honoring the achievements of Black professionals 
and entrepreneurs throughout the U.K. The Company was the sole 
retail apparel event sponsor and hosted an onsite booth dedicated to 
networking and recruitment. Our Head of DE&I was a featured panelist 
on “Black Women Business Talks,” which offers interactive group 
discussions, insights and advice on career success for Black women.
Courageous Conversations 
An inclusive culture is one where people feel heard and can connect 
with others as their authentic selves. Since 2020, we have created 
Company-wide safe spaces for open dialogue through our Courageous 
Conversations series. These monthly forums provide a platform for 
employees to share their thoughts and experiences on topics pertaining 
to DE&I, mental health, well-being and more. Considering cultural 
nuances across regions, we offer these conversations in a variety of local 
languages for our global workforce. 
Case Study
RL Learning Academy: Community
Our RL Learning Academy: Community program supports diverse talent 
through leadership development, capability-building and networking. 
The program provides participants with executive sponsorship, guided 
mentoring and learning experiences for cohorts of Black, Hispanic/
Latinx and Asian employees on two tracks: people management and 
executive leadership.

Championing Diverse Stories
Ralph Lauren makes a conscious effort to celebrate the communities 
that inspire us and elevate all voices through our brand. We aim to deliver 
on our commitment to inclusion by leveraging the power of our brand to 
expand our portrayal of the American dream.
#RLPride
In 2022, we celebrated #RLPride through the perspectives of unique 
LGBTQIA+ luminaries in our “Authors of the American Dream” campaign. 
This campaign demonstrated that the American dream is as much an 
ideal as it is a responsibility — one that each of us carries to create an 
equitable society where all are free to be their authentic selves and lead 
a fulfilling life with those they love. As a part of this effort, we elevated 
conversations with LGBTQIA+ thought leaders, spanning from freedom 
and love to Stonewall and liberation, grounding our reexamination of what 
the American dream represents to LGBTQIA+ communities. 
The campaign highlighted Ralph Lauren’s more than 30-year history 
of support for these communities and our continued partnership with 
Stonewall Community Foundation, which makes strategic investments 
in communities through an international network of change-making 
organizations, touching many different LGBTQIA+ needs.
“I’ve always believed in the 
power of sharing stories 
— the spaces they create, 
the communities they 
build, and the way heritage 
is preserved through 
them. Stories inspire us to 
dream and offer endless 
opportunities not only for 
ourselves but for all those 
who come after.” 
—
Black History Month 
As a Company and community, our belief in the power of dreams is at the 
core of who we are and how we appear in the world. We remain committed 
to showcasing that belief, keeping the people, cultures and lifestyles that 
inspire us — including Black experiences — at the forefront of  
our storytelling.
To that end, in February 2023, we produced our first full-scale Black 
History Month campaign, titled “A Heritage Preserved.” The campaign 
invited four cultural leaders to the historical Akwaaba Mansion in Bedford-
Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, for a conversation on the importance of preserving 
Black heritage.

Employee Impact Groups
Our Employee Impact Groups (EIGs) harness the talent and passion of 
our employees around the world to help create an inclusive and diverse 
company culture. In 2023, we launched a new framework, shifting to a more 
customized approach to ensure accessibility for employees worldwide. 
Formerly called Employee Resource Groups, our newly renamed Employee 
Impact Groups aim to bring employees together based on shared 
experiences and the desire to be allies and advocates. They create 
learning and engagement opportunities and provide a space for support 
and change agency based on community-specific goals. 
Our mission is to create EIGs that enable the organization to: 
•	 Deliver results that tie directly to our Next Great Chapter:  
Accelerate business strategy by fostering a culture where all 
employees can thrive
•	 Advance a trustful and engaged work environment, with diversity of 
thought and passionate employees
•	 Boost inclusive leadership capabilities to promote a sense of 
belonging for all employees
•	 Empower our employees to positively impact our workplace and the 
communities in which we live and serve
Ralph Lauren currently has 12 global and regional EIGs, as well as 19 local 
EIGs representing specific geographic areas.

Pledges, Actions and Allyship for Social Justice
At Ralph Lauren, we believe everyone deserves to be respected and 
treated equally. We work to make this a reality in broader society through 
new and continued support of initiatives that promote social justice.
#TimeToVote
We recognize the importance of every voice in our political process 
with our support of the nonpartisan #TimeToVote pledge, which aims 
to increase voter participation in U.S. elections. As a part of this pledge, 
we ensure Ralph Lauren employees in the U.S. are offered paid time off 
and increased flexibility as needed on Election Day. We also ensure all 
employees have access to trusted nonpartisan information and resources 
regarding their eligibility, methods and deadlines for casting their ballot. 
LGBTQIA+ Rights
At the center of Ralph Lauren’s 30-year history of supporting LGBTQIA+ 
communities is a deeply held belief that everyone deserves to live a life 
filled with dignity, compassion, respect and love. In this spirit, we were a 
member and signatory of three Human Rights Campaign initiatives in 
2022 in support of LGBTQIA+ communities.
Stand with Asian Americans
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian communities in the 
U.S. and worldwide have seen an increase in acts of racism and targeted 
violence. We firmly believe in every individual’s human right to safety 
and respect, and we are proud to join Stand with Asian Americans, an 
organization focused on ending violence and discrimination against Asian 
communities in the U.S.
HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN 
(HRC) INITIATIVES
In 2022, Ralph Lauren  
proudly supported: 
HRC’s Business Coalition for 
Equality Act which supports 
legislation in the U.S. that would 
protect members of LGBTQIA+ 
communities against discrimination.
HRC’s Business Statement on 
Anti-LGBTQ State Legislation 
which calls on U.S. lawmakers to 
oppose or abandon discriminatory 
laws, including those that unjustly 
target transgender people 
LGBTQIA+ parents and youth.
HRC’s campaign to support the 
Respect of Marriage Act, which was 
signed into U.S. law in December 
2022, ensuring federal recognition of 
marriage regardless of gender, race, 
ethnicity or nationality.

CHAMPIONING DISABILITY EQUITY
At Ralph Lauren, we are committed to respect and advocacy for 
people with disabilities through engagement, education, employment 
and product. On this journey, we aim to support diverse talent in our 
organization, inclusion in our design, accessibility in our sales channels 
and advocacy in our communities. 
In 2022, we reiterated our pledge to the Valuable 500, committing to 
work with other brands to ignite systemic change for disability equity.  
To help put our pledge into action, we launched a new employee-led  
Disability Equity Impact Group to champion Company-wide disability 
objectives including: 
•	 Employee training and education
•	 Increased representation
•	 Visibility in communications
•	 Accessibility within our digital and brick-and-mortar marketplace
•	 Identification of key partners to progress social inclusion
In 2023, we are launching Disability 360, an enterprise-wide equity 
strategy that supports people with disabilities through education, 
talent, culture and product. From accessible design collaborations to 
our continued support of Team USA’s Paralympians, Disability 360 
aims to recognize the potential, talent and contributions of people 
with disabilities. Given the magnitude of this strategy, we will be 
launching it in phases. Our first phase will focus on offering baseline 
education opportunities to our employees, developing relationships with 
organizations that can help guide us on our journey and learning how we 
can best support communities with disabilities. 
Pay Parity
We take a proactive approach to pay equity, continually monitoring our 
compensation programs to ensure fairness and identify any necessary 
corrective actions. Annually, we conduct a pay equity assessment 
globally for gender and in the U.S. for race and ethnicity. Leveraging 
an independent, third-party software program, we’re able to compare 
employee compensation, identify patterns more precisely and determine 
any course corrections needed to ensure fairness in our pay practices. We 
review these results and remediate where necessary. In FY23, our female 
employees in the U.S. earned an average of 99 cents for every $1 earned 
by males and 98 cents for every $1 globally. In the U.S., our non-white 
employees earned an average of 99 cents for every dollar earned by  
white employees.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our Approach to Employee Wellness
As our employees navigate challenging times, it is important for us to be 
supportive in and out of their workdays and aid their resilience in the face 
of life’s demands. Our Employee Global Wellness Committee champions 
workplace activities that inspire healthy habits, create positive work-life 
balance and generally promote well-being. From mindfulness webinars to 
exercise courses, we offer comprehensive resources to foster wellness.
This year, we relaunched our Ralph Lauren Well-being Exchange. The 
program creates opportunities for qualified employees to volunteer their 
time to teach skills they are proud to share. During these regular sessions, 
employees lead general wellness and learning experiences for their 
coworkers such as yoga, meditation, Zumba®, painting, origami and more. 
THRIVE Global Wellness Program
THRIVE, our global wellness program, provides access to benefits such as 
flexible work arrangements, sabbaticals and other support mechanisms. In 
FY22, we partnered with an external vendor, THRIVE Global, to launch an 
app-based support tool that allows our global employees to set actionable 
wellness goals called microsteps and track their progress. This tool is 
interactive, on-demand and helps employees succeed through features 
that make connections and access supporters. Local benefit offerings 
can be added to the platform to increase engagement. For example, we 
added a new benefit to our U.S.-based employees called Gympass, which 
provides employees a large selection of wellness gyms, studios and apps.
Employee Safety & Security 
The safety and well-being of our employees is our top priority. In 2022, 
we began offering an innovative preventative safety and security service, 
the Bond app. For situations that make employees feel unsafe, but may 
not warrant a call to 911, the Bond app can be used for the services of a 
security professional using voice, video and chat. The service is available 
24/7 at no cost to our corporate and retail employees in North America.
Employee Well-Being
The contributions of 
our employees make 
Ralph Lauren a vibrant 
organization. Our people 
drive our success, and we 
are dedicated to supporting 
the physical, emotional, 
social and financial needs 
of our employees and their 
families to help them thrive. 
We focus on employee 
wellness, engagement, 
learning and development, 
and compensation  
and benefits.

& OVERVIEW
Employee Mental Health 
We strive to help employees face the challenges of everyday life and 
have committed to supporting efforts that prioritize mental health. Our 
Employee Assistance Plan (EAP) is available globally, providing services to 
employees when they need them. In 2022, we updated our U.S. employee 
medical plans so that out-of-network mental health services are covered 
at the same level as in-network. We also continue our meeting-free days 
policy to enable better balance and focus during the work week.
Support for Gender Equity and Reproductive Rights 
We believe that our Company and our society are stronger when women’s 
rights are prioritized and gender equity is championed. Ralph Lauren is a 
founding partner of Parity.org, the leading impact organization focused on 
increasing representation of women and people of color in organizational 
leadership. The organization celebrated its fifth anniversary in 2022, and 
we earned its Best Companies for Women to Advance designation for 
a third consecutive year. We also earned a ranking on the Bloomberg 
Gender Equality Index.
At Ralph Lauren, we remain committed to respecting the right to personal 
choice when making individual healthcare decisions. For us, that means we 
will continue to support those seeking reproductive healthcare services, 
including covering costs associated with travel for employees seeking care 
out-of-state, as we do for a range of other healthcare services already — 
from surrogacy to cancer care.
Due to potential state-by-state inconsistencies and uncertainty 
surrounding reproductive healthcare services in the U.S., we publicly 
reiterated this commitment in 2022 and expanded our benefits offerings 
to cover costs associated with employees seeking out-of-state services, 
including coverage for upfront travel expenses.

•	 Skill-building through our Ralph Lauren Workday Learning platform
•	 Our RL Learning Academy collection of customized

Specific to DE&I education, we continued to focus on inclusive leadership 
and added to our DE&I Curriculum the ‘Includership’ program globally. In 
addition, we are continuing to evolve our cultural awareness training. We 
also offer open enrollment learning for all employees called ‘Drive Your 
Success’. Each quarter, the content is refreshed and has a focus on key 
DE&I learning mapped to activities for that quarter. All of our employee 
learning and development programs aim to promote our Ralph Lauren 
Success Drivers — the attributes, skills, ways of thinking and behaviors  
that create the conditions for individual and team success. 
Employee Engagement and Enablement Scores
In FY23, we saw an increase in the number of Learning Hours and Learning 
Instances. We aim to create a positive work environment that supports 
all our employees. To that end, we conduct an employee engagement and 
enablement survey annually to gain feedback for continuous improvement. 
Ralph Lauren achieved 83% Engagement and 75% Enablement in FY23.
Engagement is based on four questions related to pride for the company, a

SPP focuses on four areas of impact to guide programs, partnerships  
and initiatives:
•	 Wellness & Prevention — We promote the health and wellness of 
our communities through support and collaborative development of 
programs for education, advocacy and access to health care. 
•	 Citizenship & Sustainability — We work with our sustainability teams 
to recycle, repurpose and donate product to extend the lifecycle of 
excess and aged product. We also support clean water initiatives and 
other sustainable business practices.
•	 Education & DE&I — Company programs support education for 
students, such as UNCF’s scholarships providing need-based and 
last dollar awards to students from system-impacted communities to 
complete their degree. We provide scholarships for students annually 
through our partnerships with Asian University for Women, the Asian 
American Scholarship Fund, the American Indian College Fund 
and the Hispanic Scholarship Fund. We also support initiatives that 
empower women and galvanize our Employee Impact Groups.
•	 Ralph Lauren Gives Back and Community Resilience — The

Cancer Care and Prevention
More than 30 years ago, Ralph Lauren made a personal commitment to do 
all that he could to contribute to the fight against cancer. His dedication 
serves as inspiration to the Foundation and Company in their respective 
efforts to support cancer care and prevention. 
$25 MILLION COMMITMENT FOR CANCER CARE 
In 2022, the Foundation announced a $25 million commitment in new 
grant funding to expand or establish five Ralph Lauren-named cancer 
centers aimed at reducing disparities in cancer care and access 
across underserved communities in the United States. The White 
House recognized the Foundation’s philanthropic pledge as a leading 
example of public and private sector partners coming together and 
answering its Cancer Moonshot call to action to accelerate progress 
against the disease.
The $25 million commitment, the largest single funding pledge in the 
Foundation’s history, will benefit institutions with a National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) designation, including the Ralph Lauren Center for 
Cancer Prevention at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer 
Center and Memorial Sloan Kettering Ralph Lauren Center (MSK RLC). 
The Foundation is collaborating with Conquer Cancer Foundation of 
the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), to identify and 
select three additional grant recipients.

& OVERVIEW
Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Prevention at Georgetown Lombardi 
Comprehensive Cancer Center — Washington, D.C.
This year, the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Prevention at Georgetown 
Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center opened to help address 
disparities in healthcare in Washington, D.C. Building on Ralph Lauren’s 
longstanding collaboration with Georgetown Lombardi, this Center is 
aimed at helping residents get the cancer care they need by bringing a 
dynamic patient navigation model and comprehensive cancer resources  
to underserved communities in Southeast Washington.
Services at this newly remodeled facility build upon the programming 
and impact of the previous practices of the Capital Breast Care Center, 
which has been a fixture in the community for more than 15 years. The 
Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Prevention at Georgetown Lombardi 
offers comprehensive cancer resources to the diverse populations 
disproportionately impacted by breast, lung, colorectal, prostate and other 
cancers — from screening to treatment, when necessary. The Center also 
includes a wider array of cancer-focused services, targeted outreach and 
education in collaboration with MedStar Health, Georgetown’s academic 
health system partner. 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Ralph Lauren Center (MSK RLC) —  
Harlem, New York
For almost 20 years, MSK RLC has offered cancer prevention, diagnosis, 
treatment and support services in a warm, welcoming and culturally 
sensitive environment. MSK RLC has cared for thousands of people, making 
it a beacon for accessible, compassionate cancer care for residents of 
Harlem and beyond.
In 2022, MSK RLC had about 10,000 patient visits and performed around 
1,900 mammograms. MSK RLC’s supportive services include a renowned 
patient navigation program, financial counseling and an array of other social 
services. There is also a medically tailored food pantry supplemented with 
nutritional counseling. MSK RLC is highly active in the community — it 
provides health education and health screenings, and promotes health and 
wellness for area residents.

22 Years of Pink Pony
For more than two decades, we have supported cancer-fighting 
organizations around the world through the Company and the Foundation. 
Since its founding, the Pink Pony Fund of The Ralph Lauren Corporate 
Foundation has helped thousands of patients in the U.S., primarily through 
making patient navigation programs possible across the country.
Pink Pony is the Company’s worldwide initiative in the fight against cancer, 
supporting programs for research, screenings, early diagnosis, treatment, 
education, and patient navigation through Foundation grants in the U.S. and 
Company donations around the world. The 2022 Pink Pony campaign built 
upon the Company’s continued commitment, with donations raised from 
the annual product collections benefiting the Foundation’s Pink Pony Fund 
and an international network of cancer charities. 
Royal Marsden Partnership
For 10 years, the Company has supported The Royal Marsden Cancer 
Charity, opening The Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research 
in 2016. In 2023, we look forward to the opening of a new Ralph Lauren 
Research Wing within their Oak Cancer Centre. Additionally, Ralph Lauren 
employees in the U.K. are deeply connected to the organization, annually 
raising funds for Royal Marsden through Pink Pony activities.
Fondazione AIRC per la Ricerca sul Cancro Research Grant
In 2021, the Company entered into a two-year partnership with Fondazione 
AIRC per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC), supporting the advancement  
of research projects aimed at making cancer more curable. AIRC’s 
 cancer research focuses on Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the  
U.K. For over 50 years, AIRC has refined its method to select the most 
deserving projects. 
PINK PONY ACTIVATIONS 
AROUND THE WORLD 
The Company renewed its 
commitment to cancer care access 
and prevention, as well as early 
detection. For the first time since 
the global COVID-19 pandemic, the 
Company activated our employees 
through in-person awareness, 
wellness, and fundraising events and 
activities. Our Pink Pony Initiative 
activated the power of over 1,700 
employees who participated in 
nine walks/runs, generated over 
4,200 volunteer hours and held 17 
fundraising events globally.

Protecting the Environment
Environmental sustainability is integrated throughout our value chain. 
These efforts are supported respectively by the Foundation and the 
Company through grants, partnerships, and programs aimed at protecting 
our planet and providing access to critical natural resources. The 
Foundation partners with organizations focused on local community  
needs including sustainable cotton development, safe water, adequate 
sanitation and proper hygiene solutions.
U.S. REGENERATIVE COTTON FUND
In 2021, the Foundation and the nonprofit Soil Health Institute (SHI) 
announced the creation of the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund 
(USRCF), a unique, farmer-facing, science-based initiative housed 
at SHI that supports long-term, sustainable cotton production in the 
U.S. with a goal to eliminate one million metric tons of carbon dioxide 
equivalent from the atmosphere by 2026. The USRCF works toward 
this goal by empowering growers and their trusted advisors with the 
education, tools, information and networks they need to successfully 
adopt regenerative soil health systems. The USRCF is focused on five 
key initiatives:
•	 Standardizing soil measurement and goal setting through  
the development of soil health targets
•	 Establishing the business case through analysis of  
soil health economics
•	 Farmer education and empowerment through soil  
health training
•	 Building the regenerative movement through impact 
assessment and communication
•	 Creating a resilient future through diversity, equity and 
inclusion programs
In 2022, SHI hosted five aspiring young soil scientists from four 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities as part of the USRCF 
Internship Program. Participants engaged in soil sampling, impact 
assessment and professional development in soil science.
After USRCF’s first year of research, SHI data from five farms showed 
that by employing innovation in agriculture and regenerative cotton 
cultivation, farmers gained an average of $100 an acre with these 
more sustainable practices.
This past year, other leading industry and philanthropic peers have 
joined USRCF in support of the goal to reach nine states representing 
85% of U.S. cotton production. 
The Foundation’s founding 
contribution to USRCF has primarily 
supported work in four states: 
•	
Texas
•	
Arkansas
•	
Mississippi 
•	
Georgia

DigDeep — Navajo Water Project, U.S. 
DigDeep is a human rights nonprofit working to ensure that every person 
living in the U.S. has clean, running water and proper sanitation. DigDeep’s 
Navajo Water Project is a community-managed utility alternative that 
brings hot and cold running water to homes without access to water or 
sewer lines on the Navajo Nation. In 2020, the Foundation made a three-
year commitment to support the implementation of DigDeep’s Navajo 
Water Project which serves hundreds of Navajo families each year. The 
Foundation’s commitment has directly funded 33 Home Water Systems 
from 2020-2022. 
In 2022, supported by commitments like the one made by the Foundation, 
the Navajo Water Project expanded to serve more communities, bringing 
Home Water Systems to 200 additional homes and delivering more than 
one million gallons of water to people across the Navajo Nation.
GiveMeTap
The Company partners with GiveMeTap to provide clean, safe drinking 
water sources to communities in rural Africa. GiveMeTap’s mission is to 
provide access to clean drinking water and reduce plastic waste. To date, 
our partnership has funded 43 water pumps in communities, primary 
schools and health centers, which will directly benefit approximately 
43,000 people in the Upper West Region of Ghana with access to  
clean water.
As a part of our partnership with and support for GiveMeTap, the Company 
recently sent a delegation of employees from diverse backgrounds, regions 
and roles within the organization to Ghana. The aim of the visit was to 
foster meaningful connections with communities that are beneficiaries of 
Ralph Lauren-funded GiveMeTap water pumps, to support the installation 
process for several new pumps and to learn firsthand about the impacts of 
safe drinking water scarcity.
The Company’s partnership 
with GiveMeTap will directly 
benefit approximately 
43,000 people in the Upper 
West Region of Ghana with 
access to clean water.

Education, Advocacy and Access 
At Ralph Lauren, we are committed to creating more pathways to equity  
in education for system-impacted students. Through their work in 
education, advocacy and access, the Ralph Lauren Corporation and The 
Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation direct funds and foster programs that 
champion DE&I, women’s empowerment, and health and wellness in our 
global communities. 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)
In 2021, The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation launched scholarship 
programs supporting HBCUs as part of its work to help create greater 
equity and access to education for diverse and system-impacted groups. 
The Foundation grants support students at Morehouse College,  
Spelman College and 10 additional HBCUs through the United Negro 
College Fund (UNCF). 
UNCF aims to increase the total annual number of African American 
college graduates by focusing on activities that ensure more students are 
college-ready, enroll in college and persist to graduation. The Foundation 
will support at least 20 students over the four-year commitment via  
The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation scholarship program. This 
donation is in addition to its annual sponsorship of UNCF’s National Walk 
for Education.
Additionally, the Company works with UNCF to amplify the mission in order 
to broaden the potential of positive outcomes for students, augmenting 
their chance to matriculate and enter the workforce successfully. This, 
in turn, serves as a precursor to establishing a robust and sustainable 
pipeline of future talent.
Through the value of equitable access to education, the Company remains 
steadfastly committed to creating more avenues for access within the 
fashion industry and beyond. In March 2023, UNCF recognized the Ralph 
Lauren Corporation’s partnership and collaborative efforts to support 
HBCUs and system-impacted students by honoring the Company with its 
Corporate Partner Award at the “A Mind Is…”® New York Gala.
Pin of Solidarity
In 2022, the Company extended its Pin of Solidarity program for 
consumer purchase, 100% of the profits from which benefit the UNCF 
Ralph Lauren Scholarship program. We also launched the pin in five major 
European markets, benefiting scholarship and bursary programs through 
the Stephen Lawrence Day Foundation. The Stephen Lawrence Day 
Foundation funds scholarships and bursary programs for students in the 
U.K. to create more pathways for equity. 
UNCF recognized Ralph 
Lauren Corporation with its 
Corporate Partner Award 
for supporting HBCUs and 
system-impacted students.

actions to Canada and Mexico. 
LGBTQIA+ Community Allyship
A longtime ally of the LGBTQIA+ community, The Ralph Lauren Corporate 
Foundation has partnered with many organizations, most notably the 
Hetrick-Martin Institute — the oldest LGBTQIA+ youth nonprofit in the U.S. 
The Institute works to provide critical social services to at-risk, LGBTQIA+ 
youth, primarily those of color.
For more than 15 years, the Foundation has partnered with them on 
Café HMI, which addresses hunger and food insecurity through its 
meal program. Café HMI functions at the heart of the Institute — giving 
LGBTQIA+ youth a chance to be a part of an affirming community while 
also receiving compassionate care.
In addition to providing meals, HMI provides its youth members with access 
to mental health services, social services, basic needs such as toiletries 
and clothing, as well as remote and in-person programming services

Supporting HIV/AIDS Initiatives
The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation is a longstanding supporter of 
communities affected by HIV and AIDS. Over the years, the Foundation has 
contributed to a number of HIV/AIDS initiatives that help raise awareness 
and bring attention to the epidemic, including:
•	 Treatment and cure research, along with advocacy initiatives 
supporting the needs of people living with HIV, led by amfAR,  
The Foundation for AIDS Research
•	 Funding provided to the Elton John AIDS Foundation to help provide 
access to HIV services and care as well as reduce the stigma around 
the disease globally
•	 Honoring the more than 100,000 New Yorkers who have died of AIDS 
as a named sponsor of the New York City AIDS Memorial
•	 Supporting AIDS Walks for decades by bringing together hundreds 
of Ralph Lauren employees, friends and family across the country for 
awareness events in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles
Supporting Local Communities 
Our employees are a critical driver of our efforts to give back, and both 
the Company and the Foundation have programs in place to support 
their contributions of time, talent and funding as well as enable deeper 
connection to their communities. 
Ralph Lauren Gives Back Volunteering Program 
Consistent with their shared goal to promote volunteerism, Ralph Lauren 
Gives Back (RLGB) is a joint program between the Company and the 
Foundation that enables Ralph Lauren employees to volunteer year-
round across causes that are aligned with our collective strategic focus 
areas. Funding for volunteer opportunities may come from the Foundation 
or the Company to maximize support for employees who wish to give 
back, both in-person and virtually. While virtual volunteering continued 
as a part of the RLGB strategy, FY23 in-person volunteer events with 
our nonprofit partners were reestablished, and the number of in person 
activations increased incrementally as the year progressed. We recognized 
the momentum this created and will respond in FY24 by expanding our 
volunteer opportunities from three weeks per year to four focus months, 
one for each of the philanthropic focus areas, to afford employees the 
flexibility to volunteer throughout the year.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Rights & Empowerment 
in the Supply Chain
Our Approach 
We believe safe, enabling, inclusive and sustainable workplaces contribute 
to workers realizing a better life. To support this, Ralph Lauren works with 
suppliers to build capabilities, with workers to empower them and with 
industry partners to collaborate for positive change. 
Our comprehensive approach integrates risk assessment, monitoring, 
remediation, capability building, stakeholder engagement, life skills 
programs and empowerment opportunities for factory workers. 
Our Commitment to Respect Human Rights
Our Purpose is grounded in a commitment to respect the human rights 
of all those affected by our global operations. Our Human Rights Policy 
outlines this commitment in detail.
We implement this policy in our supply chain through human rights 
due diligence (HRDD) efforts that seek to identify, prevent, mitigate 
and remediate any adverse impacts. We do so in alignment with the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence 
Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment & Footwear 
Sector and the United Nations Guiding Principles. Read more about how 
we respect the rights of factory workers and our HRDD approach in our 
Human Rights Disclosure.
Championing Factory Workers
We take a holistic approach to championing factory workers, focusing on 
life skills, female representation in leadership roles and wage management, 
to drive positive impact. Recognizing the critical role of women in this 
sector, we focus on removing barriers and empowering them to have 
agency over their own lives and access to opportunities. Transformational 
change is possible when workers are supported, with cascading positive 
impacts to their families and society. 
We cannot move the needle forward on our own. A multistakeholder 
approach is necessary to overcome some of the structural challenges 
to progress, like operating in shared factories where other brands also 
source. This is why we are collaborating with stakeholders across the 
industry to increase efficiency and scale impact.
At Ralph Lauren, we are 
committed to conducting our 
global operations ethically 
with respect for the dignity 
of all people who make our 
products. Our approach aims 
to create a positive impact in 
the lives of factory workers 
and their families.
2030 GOALS
•	
Make empowerment and life 
skills programs available to 
250,000 workers across our 
supply chain
•	
All strategic and key 
suppliers will have the 
capabilities and systems 
in place to deliver fair and 
timely compensation
2025 GOAL
•	
Achieve a 25% increase of 
women in factory leadership 
that seeks to create a path 
to parity
2023 GOAL

Life Skills and Worker Empowerment 
HERproject™
To help achieve our goal of making empowerment and life skills 
programming available to 250,000 workers across our supply chain, 
we partner with a range of local specialists, including our longstanding 
partnership with Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) to sponsor 
HERproject™, a collaborative initiative to empower women working in 
global supply chains through workplace-based interventions. Our current 
programs include: HERhealth™ in Vietnam, HERfinance™ in Cambodia and 
HERessentials™ in India and Guatemala.
Building on the success of the HERessentials™ pilot in Bangladesh and 
a similar pilot in India, we co-sponsored the pilot of HERessentials™ 
in Guatemala in FY23. The training program builds workers’ adaptive 
capacity and resilience in the face of crisis. This tablet-based learning 
app engages workers and managers on health, financial inclusion and 
gender equality. The app-based design of HERessentials™ also helps to 
increase the digital literacy of workers, empowering them in an increasingly 
technology-driven world.
Just as we adapt our approach to different circumstances and geographies, 
HERessentials™ learnings are adapted to the local context. To expand the 
HERessentials™ program to the garment industry in Guatemala, the first 
step was to conduct a participatory needs assessment. The HERproject™ 
team and Cooperative for American Remittances to Everywhere 
(CARE) Guatemala undertook a needs assessment to solicit worker and 
management feedback across the three factories in the pilot, including one 
Ralph Lauren supplier facility.
The needs assessment, which is based on worker perceptions, highlighted 
workers’ interest in learning about healthy diets, stress management 
and digital and tech skills. In addition, financial health and security were 
identified as urgent issues to support workers’ resilience and stress 
management. The HERessentials™ training will address these identified 
needs and workers’ interests over the next year. 
REIMAGINING INDUSTRY 
TO SUPPORT EQUALITY
We are supporting the launch of 
Reimagining Industry to Support 
Equality (RISE), formerly known 
as Empower@Work. RISE is a 
collaborative initiative supporting 
the industry to advance equality for 
female workers in global garment 
supply chains. The initiative 
brings together the four largest 
women’s empowerment programs 
in the apparel industry — BSR’s 
HERproject™, Gap Inc. P.A.C.E, CARE 
and Better Work — to build from 
proven approaches, scale impact 
and improve efficiency.
In FY24, we look forward to exploring 
the suite of options made available 
by RISE to expand the availability 
of empowerment and life skills 
programs to factory workers across 
our supply chain.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
South India Mills Program
We recognize the longstanding forced labor risks to young women and girls 
working in the spinning and textile mills across the South Indian state of 
Tamil Nadu. As a member of a multistakeholder initiative implemented by 
the local NGO Social Awareness and Voluntary Education (SAVE), along 
with three other brands, we work to mitigate these risks and create a textile 
industry that respects human rights, empowers workers in the community 
and mills and promotes fair recruitment practices across Tamil Nadu.
The program maintains a three-prong approach to addressing the root 
causes and key actors by focusing on the labor agents who recruit workers, 
the communities where workers originate and the spinning mills who 
employ them. As many mills rely on labor agents to recruit workers, the 
program trains them on legal requirements and ethical practices that 
are key to preventing forced and child labor. To date, almost 80 agents, 
managing over 2,500 workers, have been trained.
At the mill level, workers and middle management receive training on life 
skills and a decent working environment. As of FY23, over 1,600 workers 
benefited from the trainings. In addition, the program introduced the This 
Is My Backyard (TIMBY) app to community and resource centers covering 
over 900 workers. TIMBY is a platform for workers to raise grievances 
about any aspect of the employment process. These grievances are 
addressed in a multistakeholder approach through the suppliers with 
support of industry associations, SAVE and brands. TIMBY will be rolled 
out to mills in the next phase of the program development.
Within the community, the program established six resource centers, which 
provide learnings on financial and digital literacy, legal rights, reproductive 
health and nutrition, as well as pre-departure training. Teaching these life 
skills is critical to developing the awareness and confidence to handle 
difficult situations in workers’ personal and professional lives. To-date, 
11,400 current and prospective workers and their families have benefited 
from the resource centers with 91% being female. 
As of FY23, SAVE implemented the program in six mills, impacting over 
14,600 beneficiaries. Moving forward, the program aims to expand TIMBY 
to Tier 1 factories, onboard additional mills and explore opportunities for 
more brand partners. 
98,402
workers reached through  
our life skills and  
empowerment programs.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Advancing Equity & Inclusion through 
the Gender Equity Worker Voice Tool 
We are committed to engaging with the rights holders that move 
our supply chain forward. Worker voice tools, such as surveys, allow 
workers to share their needs and experiences at work. These insights 
can be used to inform better policies, programs and business decisions 
at the factory and brand level. As female garment workers face 
different vulnerabilities and demands, worker voice tools need to have 
specific gender considerations to promote equity and inclusion in 
supply chains. 
In FY23, we participated in the Gender Equity Worker Engagement 
Group (GEWEG), a partnership between global brands and the 
International Center for Research on Women (ICRW). Ralph Lauren and 
brand partners co-financed the creation of holistic worker voice and 
employee engagement tools to address the challenges women face 
across supply chains and support their well-being. For example, ICRW 
created the Gender Equity Worker Voice Tool, a survey with gender-
responsive questions across 10 themes, including gender-based 
violence and sexual harassment, professional development and skills 
building, and employee evaluation and promotion. This tool can fit into 
existing surveys and addresses a blind spot in the worker voice space.
The Gender Equity Worker Voice Tool was piloted in six factories 
across Vietnam, Indonesia and China with a total of 1,813 respondents. 
This was followed up by a series of focus group discussions to further 
refine the survey questions. For suppliers that also used the ICRW Self-
Diagnostic Tool (SDT), which is completed by factory management, the 
worker questionnaire could be used as a basis for comparison to find 
areas of convergence and misalignment. 
The pilot survey results found that workers generally felt positive about 
their safety, health and wellbeing, and confident in their workplace 
reporting systems for gender-based violence and harassment. 
Some areas for improvement included elimination of gender-based 
discrimination and support for working parents.
We will continue to use and glean insights from the Gender Equity 
Worker Voice Tool in our upcoming worker voice surveys.

In the global apparel 
industry, most factory 
workers are women. Our 
supply chain follows this 
demographic trend with 
women accounting for  
67% of the workforce.  
As of FY23, the ratio of 
female supervisors to  
total supervisors stands  
at around 40%.
Our efforts to increase women in factory leadership are focused on 
countries where our gender ratio data shows the most opportunity for 
improvement: Bangladesh, Guatemala, India and Peru. To make this work 
sustainable, we take a holistic approach, empowering and upskilling female 
workers to take on leadership roles, while working on factory-wide systems 
to counter approaches that prevent women from accessing more  
senior roles.
As of FY23, we have exceeded our goal of increasing women in factory 
leadership by 25%, achieving a 27% average increase across our four 
target countries. 
Achieving our goal was driven by strong progress made in Bangladesh and 
India, the two countries with the steepest gap between female operator 
and female supervisor representation. We will continue to make progress 
in this work as we recognize the various and unique cultural factors that 
continue to hinder the career advancement of women factory workers. As 
we look ahead, we will continue to focus on these countries, especially in 
Bangladesh and India, where significant room for improvement remains.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Promoting Inclusive Workplaces in Latin America
Creating diverse, equitable and inclusive workplaces is something 
the Company strives to accomplish, in our supply chains and our own 
operations. This year, we continued our supplier DE&I roundtables with 
a workshop for our suppliers in Latin America, including Guatemala, 
Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. This workshop discussed what DE&I is, why 
it is important and actions companies can take to foster comfortable 
workplaces. Participating suppliers were provided a toolkit that included 
tips for developing a DE&I commitment, strategy and workforce 
engagement. They were further required to submit their own DE&I 
commitment and a Women in Leadership Action Plan for how they will 
support women’s advancement to supervisory roles. This workshop was 
paired with the release of our open-source online DE&I training for supplier 
management titled, Respect and Inclusion, an Introduction for Global 
Supply Chains, commissioned through BSR and available in four languages 
(English, Spanish, Hindi and Vietnamese). In addition to other strategic 
priorities, we hope this DE&I workstream promotes work cultures that 
further the promotion of women into leadership roles.
Gender Equality and Returns Program
The biggest catalyst for success in Bangladesh was driven by our 
partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) to implement the Gender Equality 
and Returns (GEAR) Program. GEAR aims to ease the path for women 
working in garment factories to progress into supervisory roles, which 
improves their access to better jobs, contributes to increased line-level 
productivity and reduces management level gender imbalances. 
Nine Ralph Lauren-nominated suppliers completed the GEAR program. In 
total, there were 111 trainees with 70 females promoted as supervisor. This 
was instrumental to increasing the percentage of women in supervisory 
roles in our supply chain. Notably, three of the factories that completed 
GEAR did not previously have a single female supervisor. 
Apparel Training & Design Centre
Like Bangladesh, we have seen substantial increases in women in 
leadership roles in India. As of FY23, about 51% of the workforce of our 
India suppliers are women, with the ratio of female supervisors to total 
supervisors at about 14%. This represents approximately a 39% increase 
from the baseline. However, there is still much progress to be made.
This is why in FY23, we launched a partnership with the Apparel Training 
& Design Centre (ATDC), one of the largest vocational training networks 
in the garment sector in India. This partnership aims to establish a training 
program at scale to equip female factory workers with the communication 
and technical skills needed for leadership roles, providing career 
progression pathways in their sector. 
MAINTAINING PROGRESS 
AND EXPANDING 
OPPORTUNITIES
While we have achieved our female 
leadership goal, we know that 
sustaining these results is the key to 
maintaining progress and continuous 
improvement. To that end, our new 
supplier scorecard includes a 
women’s leadership performance 
indicator. Moreover, our life skills and 
empowerment programs combined 
with our worker voice efforts, will 
help address some of the structural 
barriers that make achieving gender 
equity a challenging, yet critically 
important, endeavor.

Supporting the Transition to Digital 
Wages in Cambodia 
Most of the wages in the garment sector are paid in cash. Cash 
payments can create a lack of transparency and heighten the potential 
for labor violations, among other risks and inefficiencies. These types 
of payments can also disempower women who often have less control 
over their wages when paid in cash because of traditional gender roles 
and expectations. 
To support moving the sector away from cash payments, we are 
participating in the HERfinance™ Digital Wages pilot in Cambodia 
sponsored by the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth. Cambodia 
is an important market for this pilot as it has a low level of financial 
inclusion, even compared to other producing countries. It is also a 
market where 80% of garment workers are women, further raising the 
potential to make a profound impact through this work.
The HERfinance™ Digital Wages pilot takes a three-prong 
approach to digital transition: 
1.	 Middle management training to familiarize managers with digital 
wage systems
2.	 Awareness campaigns to support suppliers in sharing payroll 
changes and the benefits of financial services with workers 
3.	 Peer educator training on financial literacy, which is particularly 
relevant for women who may not be familiar with using financial 
services or digital tools
We are piloting the program with two suppliers.
In addition to HERfinance™, we nominated three of our factories in 
Cambodia to participate in a joint project through the Textile, Apparel, 
Footwear & Travel Goods Association in Cambodia, Better Factories 
Cambodia and the ILO Global Center on Digital Wages for Decent 
Work on transitioning to digital wages. Factories in the program receive 
training on responsible wage digitization, access to advisory support, 
tools for promoting financial literacy and assistance negotiating with 
financial service providers.

Wage Management 
In FY23, we achieved our goal to roll out our Wage Management Strategy to 
all our strategic and key suppliers. We did this by activating all five modules 
of our strategy:
•	 Human rights due diligence 
•	 Supplier capabilities
•	 Worker engagement
•	 Industry collaboration 
•	 Alignment with our internal teams 
We have active workstreams within each module that provide tools and 
resources for suppliers to improve their wage systems, in addition to 
our internal work on responsible purchasing practices which better 
enable suppliers to meet their wage goals. In FY23, we finalized important 
workstreams that enable us to continue our work on wage management 
into the next phase.
Wage Data Collection and Analysis
This year, we extended our ongoing wage data collection and analysis by 
adopting the Fair Labor Association’s (FLA) Fair Compensation toolkit. 
This aligns with our aim to adopt industry tools, easing the burden on 
our suppliers and increasing the amount of comparative wage data for 
the industry. The toolkit consists of the FLA’s groundbreaking Wage 
Data Collection Tool and Fair Compensation Dashboard, which are 
scalable tools that allow companies to gather worker wage data from 
their suppliers, conduct analyses and measure progress over time. The 
Dashboard provides living wage benchmarks from over 30 countries and 
helps suppliers measure their wages against other local firms. In FY23, we 
successfully deployed the FLA tool with our strategic and key suppliers 
across more than 10 countries and for the first time in Tunisia, Turkey, 
Mexico, Bangladesh, Peru and the U.S.
Our country analysis using the FLA tool shows that in five countries — 
India, China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia — the average net wage 
increased year over year. This was primarily driven by the increase in the 
legal minimum wage. In Guatemala, the Philippines and Italy, we saw the 
average net wage decrease, year over year, due to reduced production and 
working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic.

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Assessment of Wage Management Systems
In FY23, we expanded our work to understand and address worker wage 
gaps by focusing on factory-level wage management systems. New tools 
that assess the maturity of these systems at the factory level helped us 
identify the largest and most common areas of opportunity among our 
suppliers so that we could provide targeted support. 
We completed two key workstreams: piloting our Wage Management 
Assessment Tool and conducting an in-depth factory human resource and 
production systems diagnostic. We piloted our assessment tool with nine 
factories, covering different areas that impact wage, from performance 
evaluation and job progression to skills training and worker engagement. 
We found that just under half of the factories are using performance pay, 
but often lack the accompanying investment in skills training needed 
to support this type of compensation, which is much needed due to an 
industry-wide shortage of skilled workers. In FY24, we will update the wage 
management assessment based on the findings from this pilot. 
Our in-depth factory systems diagnostic was led by a cross-functional 
team of human resources and production experts who tested our approach 
at a factory in Vietnam. The team identified several improvement 
opportunities including more insightful human resource management 
data analytics, increased labor productivity with worker skills training 
programs and worker-management communication channels for problem 
solving. Workers’ viewpoints and suggestions were collected via survey 
and in-person focus group discussions. Workers broadly identified similar 
strengths and opportunities based on their own experience and highlighted 
their top priorities as health and take-home pay. 
The insights gathered from these pilots demonstrated the need for greater 
knowledge, support and tools on factory wage management systems. 
Therefore, we have set a new goal that by 2030, all strategic and key 
suppliers will have the capabilities and systems in place to deliver fair and 
timely compensation. We will be working with them to ensure they have 
these compensation strategies in place: data collection and analytical 
processes, performance-based pay models, worker training programs, 
career pathing and two-way communication tools for workers and 
management. We will measure these critical areas with our updated Wage 
Management Assessment Tool to provide an evaluation of the suppliers’ 
current systems, and will provide guidance on how they can improve their 
current practices. 
FAIR WAGE NETWORK
We collaborated with the Fair Wage 
Network (FWN) in India to conduct 
fair wage assessments of seven 
factories in three regions: Karnataka, 
Tamil Nadu and Haryana. A fair  
wage assessment is an objective 
appraisal of wage practices at the 
factory level in relation to the Fair 
Wage framework.
The FWN results for India confirmed 
our findings that suppliers pay 
above the stipulated legal minimum 
wage. The factories all achieved 
at least FWN’s “relatively fair” 
score (the second highest level).
One factory reached the top level: 
a “Fair Wage’’ certification. Areas 
identified for improvement included 
worker representation, sustainability 
strategies, tying wages to worker 
performance and skills, coherent 
wage policies and the need for 
improved social dialogue around 
wage policies.

Assessments, Monitoring and Remediation 
Our Global Citizenship team monitors supplier compliance and evaluates 
supplier relationships based on their performance and potential.
This starts with our Operating Standards (OS), which communicate our 
expectations of suppliers. All new suppliers must meet our standards 
before we place an order with them. We undertake due diligence with 
existing suppliers by scoping potential risks, preventing and mitigating 
those identified and remediating issues when found. 
We work with suppliers to identify the root cause of issues and agree on 
corrective action plans that prioritize workers’ welfare and livelihoods. 
We remain committed to ensuring that workers have access to effective 
grievance mechanisms and that they can voice their concerns without fear 
of retaliation. 
Alongside industry-wide assessment tools like Better Work and the Social 
& Labor Convergence Program (SLCP), we use independent third-party 
assessments to complement our continuous due diligence and site-
based risk monitoring processes. Assessment results feed into our overall 
supplier scoring through our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) which 
directly influences our sourcing decisions and our strategy for managing, 
mitigating and eliminating risks in our supply chain.
In FY23, all our active factories received a performance rating, which 
ranges from green, indicating good to exceptional level of performance 
to red, indicating a violation of our Operating Standards with one or more 
critical issues and a risk of business termination. Approximately 53% of 
factories were rated as yellow, which indicates an acceptable level of 
performance requiring improvement. We saw a 7% increase in green, a 
1% increase in red ratings and a 3% decrease in orange, which indicates 
weak performance requiring significant improvement. These ratings are a 
component of analyzing supplier risk.

Supplier Assessments 
We recognize the industry-wide need to streamline the monitoring 
process, reduce audit fatigue, and reallocate resources to allow for more 
capability building and worker well-being initiatives. To that end, in FY23, 
we continued our adoption of SLCP to complement our social compliance 
assessment tools. We worked with our strategic, key and evolving suppliers 
in Tier 1 to kick-off the SLCP adoption with over 100 SLCP verifications 
reviewed and remediated, representing 33% of our business volume. With 
the use of the SLCP report, we are collaborating with other brands in the 
industry to identify joint remediation approaches, and to further streamline 
remediation efforts and communication with suppliers. In FY24, we are 
also aiming to increase the adoption of industry-common assessment 
tools (both SLCP and Better Work) to factories representing 80% of our 
business volume in Tier 1.
Overall, we take a risk-based approach to our assessments to ensure we 
are prioritizing areas for action. We assessed 81% of factories supplying 
Ralph Lauren in FY23, representing 93% of our business volume. We also 
assessed key subcontractors in FY23 with 162 subcontractors. At Tier 2, 
we monitored fabric mill suppliers that made up about 40% of our core 
fabric business, using SLCP and Better Work. We were able to conduct  
24% more assessments in FY23 than FY22 in both Tier 1 and 2, thanks to  
more efficient assessment scheduling and the return of Better Work to  
full capacity.

& OVERVIEW
The most common category of nonconformance was health and safety 
(52%). After reviewing all nonconformance issues with the suppliers, 
we agreed on a corrective action plan and followed up to ensure issues 
are addressed in a timely manner. Less than 1% of assessment findings 
revealed zero-tolerance issues. We deactivated four factories that were 
unable to remediate these issues or other OS requirements.
Working with Licensees
In addition to our own products, we license the Ralph Lauren brands to 
select companies. All licensees are required to have social compliance 
programs and standards equivalent to our own. We separately assess 
licensee supplier compliance programs and review their assessments 
to ensure that they meet our requirements. In FY23, 31 licensees used

INTRODUCTION 
& OVERVIEW
Our Data Privacy & Security Approach 
Our global information security program has multiple security measures 
in place including network segmentation, security monitoring, endpoint 
protection, identity and access management, data loss prevention 
controls and data protection best practices. To ensure that our employees 
understand their roles in preserving information security, we conduct 
cybersecurity awareness programs including regular phishing simulations 
and annual general cybersecurity awareness and data protection training, 
as well as more contextual and personalized sessions for targeted users 
and roles. We also continue to focus on user awareness, and enhance our 
defense and response mechanisms to align with emerging cyber trends 
such as ransomware and third-party supply chain risk.
We incorporate external expertise and guidance, leveraging cybersecurity 
specialists to complete external audits and objective assessments of 
our cybersecurity program and practices, as well as to conduct targeted 
attack simulations. We continually enhance our information security 
capabilities to protect against emerging threats, while also increasing 
our ability to detect and respond to cyber incidents and maximize our 
resilience to recover from potential cyber attacks. 
For business purposes, we collect, use and process personal data of 
individuals in North America, Europe and Asia. Compliance with data 
protection and privacy laws across multiple jurisdictions is core to our 
values and strategy. We utilize a variety of technical and organizational 
security measures and protocols to protect data, including data pertaining 
to our customers, employees and suppliers.
We have a data governance structure in place to continuously monitor 
for new and/or updated global directives and regulations related to data 
privacy, data protection, cyber security and data breaches. We make 
necessary adjustments to both external and internal policies and programs 
to align with the different requirements. Most recently, adjustments were 
made to align with the new SEC guidance and proposed rules, recent U.S. 
state and Canadian provincial privacy laws changes, and recent European, 
post-Brexit and Chinese regulations, including those on cross-border  
data transfers.

Data Privacy & Security
We have a longstanding 
information security risk 
program led by our Chief 
Information Security Officer, 
with oversight from our 
Board of Directors. The 
program is structured 
according to the National 
Institute of Standards and 
Technology Cybersecurity 
Framework, industry 
best practices, privacy 
legislation, and other  
global and local standards 
and regulations.

Approach to stakeholder engagement
We engage with our stakeholders at varying frequencies and in different 
formats to inform our citizenship and sustainability strategy. One of the 
many ways we accomplish this is by regularly completing a materiality 
assessment to update our understanding of these factors as well as 
stakeholder expectations for our efforts. 
Our latest materiality assessment was conducted in 2022 through 
consulting firm BSR. The assessment engaged internal and external 
stakeholders through interviews, focus groups and surveys to analyze 
our Company’s impact on society and the environment, along with our 
enterprise value. Among the external stakeholders were environmental 
and social non governmental organizations, supplier and licensee partners 
and global retailers. Internal stakeholders included employees across all 
functions, all geographies and levels of the organization.

Energy consumption within  
the organization
Total fuel consumption within the organization from nonrenewable 
sources: 802,692 GJ of natural gas, propane, fuel oil, electricity, steam  
and cooling.
Total fuel consumption within the organization from renewable sources: 
48,308 GJ of electricity.
•	 Electricity consumption: 592,051 GJ 
•	 Heating consumption: 244,345 GJ
•	 Cooling consumption: 4,887 GJ
•	 Steam consumption: 29,717 GJ
•	 Total energy consumption within the organization: 851,000 GJ
Standards, methodologies, assumptions, calculation tools and 
conversion factors used: World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol. Energy consumption calculated for energy from natural gas, 
diesel, propane, fuel oil, electricity, steam and cooling consumed at 
owned and operated global retail stores, offices and distribution centers. 
Site-specific energy use is determined using a three-tiered system, 
depending on the availability of primary data for the fiscal year. If we 
have primary data for all months that a facility was operating in the fiscal 
year, the energy usage data is simply summed. If we have partial primary 
data, existing data is scaled based on geographic region and facility type 
to fill gaps. Finally, if we have no primary data, we model yearly energy 
using facility square footage and an energy use intensity based on the 
climate zone and facility type of primary data, scaled to fill gaps.
More details on our footprint can be found in the Climate section on 
page 31 of our 2023 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report.

In FY23, we continued to progress toward our goal to conduct 80% 
of our business with suppliers that meet the key & strategic supplier 
criteria which includes business, quality, citizenship and sustainability 
performance. In FY23, 50% of our business was with suppliers that meet 
the key and strategic supplier criteria.

Negative environmental impacts in supply 
chain and actions taken
We explicitly state in our Vendor Compliance and Operating Standards 
that all suppliers are required to adhere to all applicable laws and 
regulations of the regions where they operate, including, but not limited 
to, the local environmental standards. We have the right to terminate 
our business relationship should the supplier fail to comply with the 
applicable laws and regulations. In addition to that, we are screening our 
supply base for any potential significant environmental impacts through 
the Higg Index FEM and the Institute of Public and Environmental 
Affairs (IPE) Supervision platform (the latter is specific to China-based 
facilities). If an issue is found, we require the supplier to take corrective 
action and put in place preventive measures to avoid recurrence. 
Specifically, on any violation record found on the IPE platform, we  
also require the facilities — at a minimum — to publish enterprise 
feedback onto the platform, which details the corrective and preventive 
measures taken.
In FY23, we screened all our Tier 1, subcontracted processing and top 
mills through these platforms. We identified 9 facilities with potential 
significant environmental impacts related to industrial wastewater, 
permits and air emissions. We do not use Higg FEM assessment results 
or IPE records to terminate business relationships with suppliers. We 
addressed all the identified facilities to ensure corrective action and 
preventive measures are in place.

MANAGEMENT OF CHEMICALS IN PRODUCTS	
Discussion of processes to maintain 
compliance with restricted  
substances regulations
CG-AA-250a.1
Ralph Lauren has Vendor Compliance Packets (VCP) for all mills and finished-goods 
suppliers. The VCP states suppliers must comply with American Apparel & Footwear 
Association (AAFA) Restricted Substances List (RSL). We adopt the AAFA RSL to serve 
as a practical tool that sets forth specific chemical substance bans, limitations or test 
methods, as specified by government or regulatory agencies.
We test to the strictest global standard. Tests are performed through our Apparel 
Testing Program, which ensures our products meet compliance requirements, 
regardless of their markets of distribution. It also contains protocols on how tests 
should be conducted, including all fabrics, trims or related materials, apparel, 
accessories, footwear, home textiles and components that are supplied or sold to our 
Company for use in the manufacturing or distribution of any Ralph Lauren product. 
A zero tolerance policy is in effect on any product not meeting the RLC standards as 
defined in the protocol. Suppliers are required to use only Ralph Lauren-nominated 
independent third-party testing labs to achieve passing test reports for raw materials 
and finished products prior to the shipping of product.
We also use independent third-party labs to conduct raw material risk assessments of 
our lines each year to ensure our raw material suppliers are clear on our development 
standards and deliver fabric that will meet our compliance requirements.
Our three stages of testing are:
1. Fabric testing for apparel: The testing is required for bulk yardage in all colorways and 
where approved raw-material-risk-assessment exists. A completed and passing fabric 
test is valid for six months.
2. Component testing for apparel, footwear and accessories: Suppliers are allowed to 
test the raw material and subcomponents used to produce an item. A completed and 
passing subcomponent test is valid for 12 months.
3. Finished-goods testing for home, apparel and footwear: Finished goods testing must 
be done in bulk fabric with bulk trim items. A completed and passing finished goods test 
is valid for six months.

Discussion of processes to assess and manage

in products
CG-AA-250a.2
Our process for assessing and managing risks and/or hazards associated with 
chemicals in products is described above. Policies and practices are fully aligned 
across our brands and product categories. As described above, all raw materials and 
finished products undergo testing to confirm compliance with regulations. Depending 
on the volume of orders, some styles may undergo more testing than others. We take a 
combination of hazard- and risk-based approaches to chemical management.
As mentioned above, we complete extensive risk assessments each year by raw 
material. We are fully compliant with all laws and regulations and are currently 
exploring innovations for reduction, elimination or assessment outside of that scope. 
The third-party certifications used and our approach to chemical management at 
each stage of the product life cycle are discussed above. We partner with the Zero 
Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) to work towards the alignment and 
collective action across the industry in monitoring and eliminating the usage and 
discharge of hazardous chemicals in textile, apparel and leather manufacturing, as well 
as promoting the development and adoption of safer chemical alternatives. We aim to 
eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals in our supply chain by 2025. We fully adopt 
the ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) and have communicated 
expectations to our supply chain through our Sustainable Chemicals Management 
Policy, as well as our VCP.
More details on our management of chemicals in products can be found in the  
Chemical Management section on page 40 of our 2023 Global Citizenship & 
Sustainability Report.

LABOR CONDITIONS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN	
Percentage of (1) Tier 1 supplier facilities 
and (2) supplier facilities beyond Tier 1 in 
compliance with wastewater discharge permits 
and/or contractual agreement
CG-AA-430a.1
In FY23, 99.8% of Tier 1 direct supplier facilities were in compliance with wastewater 
discharge permits and/or contractual agreements.
We explicitly state in our Vendor Compliance and Operating Standards that all suppliers 
are required to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations of the regions where they 
operate, included, but not limited to, the local environmental standards. We have the 
right to terminate our business relationship should the supplier fail to comply with the 
applicable laws and regulations. Our compliance audit also includes the compliance 
with wastewater regulations as part of the health and safety requirement.
Our main supply chain risks associated with the wastewater discharge are related to the 
usage of chemicals in production and the effluent treatment system put in place.
Our supplier facilities implement effluent treatment methods in accordance with the 
local regulatory requirements. This may include operating an on-site effluent treatment 
plant (ETP), partnering with an off-site ETP and, for some, implementing a zero liquid 
discharge effluent treatment system.
In addition to the regulatory compliance, we adopt the ZDHC MRSL and its suite of tools 
to guide and align our efforts to eliminate the use and discharge of hazardous chemicals 
with the industry’s standards and best practices. This includes the implementation 
of ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines, which goes beyond the regulatory compliance. The 
ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines provide clear guidance in effluent testing methods, 
parameters, limits and reporting approach as a way to confirm that our manufacturing 
facility is not discharging hazardous chemicals to the environment. We expanded the 
roll out of the ZDHC Wastewater Test in our supply base as part of our sustainable 
chemicals management initiative to monitor the facility’s conformance against the 
ZDHC MRSL. While the wastewater test is only a snapshot of the effluent quality of
the facility, it ensures an annual monitoring that allows us to follow up and address 
any nonconformance from its source through a root cause analysis approach that 
aligns with the ZDHC. This helps inform both the facility and Ralph Lauren on targeted 
chemicals phaseout at the facility level. Among our facilities, 66% of the Tier 1 facilities 
by business spend have performed wastewater test in accordance with the Guidelines; 
83% of the facilities, including Tier 1 and 2, that tested comply with the ZDHC 
requirement; and out of the substances screened, 99.8% comply with the  
ZDHC standard.

We monitor labor compliance against local law, national law and our Operating 
Standards through independent third party audits, together with audits conducted 
by our in-house team and assessments from Better Work and the Social & Labor 
Convergence Program (SLCP). In FY23, 81% of our Tier 1 direct supplier factories were

duplication of audits, we work with Better Work, an international organization focused 
on improving working conditions in the garment industry, to conduct audits in some of 
our factories.
In FY23, we also prioritized auditing our raw material suppliers, completing 32 audits at 
our top knit and woven fabric suppliers. One hundred percent of these were conducted 
by an independent third party.
For additional information on our supply chain auditing, including methodology, 
relationship with suppliers, transparency and efforts toward capacity building, as well as

The most common category of nonconformance was health and safety (52%). After 
reviewing all nonconformance issues with the supplier, we agreed on a corrective action 
plan and followed up to ensure issues were addressed in a timely manner. Less than 
1% of assessment findings revealed zero tolerance issues (24 of 3,752 total findings). 
We deactivated four factories that were unable to remediate these issues or other OS

As members of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, we are committed 
to measuring, improving and sharing our environmental and social 
performance. The Higg Brand & Retail Module (BRM) is a sustainability 
assessment that allows Ralph Lauren and other companies to measure 
performance against the most relevant environmental, social, and 
governance issues in our industry. 
In 2022, we completed the assessment for the 2021 BRM reporting cycle 
and received a verified score based on the Higg verification protocol.  
This score serves as our baseline for future Higg BRM assessments, 
helping us to understand areas for improvement in our environmental and 
social performance.
Based on our completion of the verified BRM assessment, we have 
identified performance improvement areas, including supply chain 
transparency and traceability. For more on our approach and progress 
around transparency and traceability, see the Responsible Sourcing
