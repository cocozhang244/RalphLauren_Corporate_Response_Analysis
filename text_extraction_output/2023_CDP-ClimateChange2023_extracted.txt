Ralph Lauren Corporation - Climate Change 2023
C0. Introduction
C0.1
(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
For more than 50 years, we have sought to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. At Ralph Lauren, we believe in creating things that are
timeless — that last and that never go out of style. Our iconic products are created to be worn, loved and passed on through generations. This ethos of timelessness extends
beyond our products to the lives, communities and natural resources our business intersects. We  call this framework Timeless by Design, our global approach to citizenship
and sustainability.  
Through Timeless by Design, we are ensuring our philosophy of timelessness is embedded from inspiration through to our products’ every use and reuse. We also continue
charitable work through our Company and The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation. With this as our North Star, we aim to reduce our overall environmental impact, advance
a circular economy and uplift and empower our communities. Our Timeless by Design approach is supported by three pillars: Create with Intent, Protect the Environment and
Champion Better Lives:  
• Create With Intent – We are working to implement circular principles and instill cultural awareness practices into our design and development  process. By designing with
timelessness in mind from the start, we are enabling our products to live on responsibly and helping our consumers to love their items longer. 
• Protect The Environment –Beyond creating products more responsibly, we are working to operate in ways that respect our planet, such as transitioning to renewable
energy, diverting waste from landfill and incineration, and efficiently managing water for our business and the communities where we operate. 
• Champion Better Lives – Shaping a business that is timeless and has a positive impact on tomorrow means building relationships that stand  the test of time and ensuring
that everyone is included, respected and empowered. That’s why we’re committed to supporting our employees, our partners and those within our communities — working to
build a brighter future. 
Our Company’s reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products, brands, distribution channels, and international markets. We believe
that our global reach, breadth of lifestyle product offerings, and multi-channel distribution are unique among luxury and apparel companies. Our global reach is extensive, as
we sell directly to customers throughout the world via our 553 retail stores and 722 concession-based shop-within-shops, as well as through our own digital commerce sites
and those of various third-party digital partners. Merchandise is also available through our wholesale distribution channels at over 9,000 doors worldwide, the majority in
specialty  stores, as well as through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers. In addition to our directly operated stores and  shops, our international
licensing partners operate 182 Ralph Lauren stores and shops.

The Nominating, Governance, Citizenship & Sustainability Committee (the Nominating 
Committee) of the Board oversees ESG risks and opportunities and receives quarterly updates,
reviews initiatives, goals, and policies, and makes recommendations to the Board on 
ESG matters, including climate-related issues. Each quarterly update to the Nominating 
Committee includes a standing agenda item on ESG-related risks and opportunities, inclusive of 
climate risks. Updates in the previous year include a summary report of our climate-related 
risks and mitigation strategies; a roadmap for our product transparency and traceability 
program to enable more accurate measurement of climate impacts and risks; and a summary of 
ESG key performance indicators, including updates on climate-related KPIs. The Finance 
Committee and the Nominating Committee advise on the incorporation of goals into our 
corporate strategy and engagement on those business initiatives that influence corporate 
citizenship and sustainability. The Audit Committee of the Board reviews ESG risks as 
part of its overall Enterprise Risk Management review. The full Board receives a report on 
citizenship and sustainability progress at least once annually and reviews the Company’s 
annual Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report and a summary report of our climate related risks
and mitigation strategies. The Talent, Culture & Total Rewards Committee (the 
Talent Committee) reviews and approves our compensation programs, including corporate 
metrics and milestones related to any ESG factors included in the compensation plans, and 
may consult the Nominating Committee on ESG goals when establishing, monitoring, or 
reviewing performance goals. For Fiscal 2023, ESG metrics in the form of a scorecard were 
selected by the Talent Committee as our strategic goal to support the importance of our 
citizenship and sustainability strategy to create positive social and environmental impacts 
across our Company, our industry and society. These ESG metrics serve as a strategic modifier 
goal which, if met, would adjust bonuses for director-level employees and above (other than 
our Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer) upwards by up to 10%.

C2.1b
(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
In our corporate Enterprise Risk Management process, risks rating criteria are used to assess the extent to which a risk event may affect the company’s strategy, finances,
operations, and/or reputation.  Substantive financial or strategic impact is defined as any risks rated as “critical” or “high”. A critical risk is defined as having one or more of the
following impacts: (1) a very high impact on the company’s ability to meet strategic goals or execute priority initiatives; (2) leading to greater than $700 million impact on
revenue or $70 million impact on our operating margin; (3) a national, sustained, negative reputational damage with stakeholders; or (4) leading to severe and potentially long-
term impact on the operations of our business. A “high” risk is defined as having one or more of the following impacts: (1) a high impact on the company’s ability to meet
strategy goals or execute priority initiatives; (2) leading to between $350 million and $700 million impact on revenue or between $35 million and $70 million impact on our
operating margin; (3) a national, short-term, negative reputational damage with stakeholders; or (4) leading to significant impact on the operations of our business. Risks and
opportunities described herein with the potential to have a "substantive financial or strategic impact on our business" are not necessarily "material" to investors as defined by
the SEC.

Description of process
Ralph Lauren’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process is used to identify and plan responses to ensure the health and life of the business enterprise and successfully
prepare our company to face risk events, including those presented by climate change. Our ERM process currently involves identifying broad ESG sustainability risks,
creating rankings of importance for each risk, and creating mitigation plans for certain risks. We primarily focus on risks within each fiscal year, rather than long-term risks.
As part of this annual ERM assessment, our Head of Global Internal Audit & Asset Protection initiates this process by meeting with leadership of different business units
(e.g., Chief Product Officer, Chief Global Impact & Communications Officer, etc.) and gathers a list of risks that each business unit has identified. From this full list, our ERM
team conducts an exercise to rank risks based on the perceived potential impact of each risk and the company’s vulnerability to that risk. This ranking is benchmarked
against the previous year’s ERM results and discussed with business unit managers to fine-tune these rankings. For each risk identified, the ERM team works with business
unit leaders to create mitigation plans for each risk. For ESG risks, this involves engaging our Chief Product Officer, Chief Global Impact & Communications Officer to
develop mitigation plans, including for those related to climate change. For top risks, our Head of Global Internal Audit & Asset Protection assigns a risk owner to manage
the risk and report to the Board of Directors quarterly. Through the ERM process, climate change has been identified as an ESG risk that requires a more granular
assessment process. To conduct this detailed climate risk assessment, we created a cross-functional Ralph Lauren Climate Risk Taskforce, designed to make the
company more resilient to evolving risks presented by climate change. On a semiannual basis, the taskforce develops and updates a Climate Risk Report to: (1) identify key
climate risks; (2) describe the risks, the level of impact, and likelihood, and ensure key actions are being taken to address risks; and (3) communicate climate risks to key
stakeholders, including our leadership team and Board of Directors. The Climate Risk Taskforce is responsible for preparing the semiannual Climate Risk Report and for
developing inputs for other internal and external reporting on climate risk, including ERM and this CDP Climate Change questionnaire. The Taskforce includes
representatives from the following teams/business units: sustainability, internal audit/risk, logistics, sourcing, investor relations, store operations/asset protection, global risk,
communications, finance, treasury, legal, and worker well-being. The Climate Risk Report is reviewed by our Global Citizenship & Sustainability Steering Committee, who is
responsible for ensuring climate risk is built into our operating model and business strategy. The Climate Risk Report is then presented to the Board of Directors, where the
Nominating, Governance, Citizenship and Sustainability Committee is responsible for oversight of sustainability and ESG matters, including climate risk. To assess climate
risks, the Taskforce describes risks according to the following categories: where the risk occurs, risk type, risk driver, time horizon, likelihood, magnitude of impact, financial
impact, and key actions to mitigate risk. Financial impact is evaluated according to the financial impact criteria used in our corporate ERM process across four tiers of impact
to our revenue and operating margin. In developing the Climate Risk Report, the Taskforce identified both climate-related physical risks and climate-related transitional
risks. One of the most critical climate-related physical risk identified by the Taskforce comes from chronic changes in weather that can affect the availability, quality, and
price of the raw materials that Ralph Lauren depends on. We are responding to this climate-related risk by implementing a sourcing strategy focused on near-shoring,
geographic diversification, and the use of sustainable materials. This strategy will help mitigate potential increases in raw material costs due to extreme weather events in
one sourcing country or region by allowing us to shift our sourcing more easily to other countries or regions. Specifically, we have set a goal to switch to 100 percent
sustainable sourced key materials by 2025, including cotton that is either from the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), Fair Trade certified, organic, recycled, transitional, or
aligned to the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol. The Taskforce also identified climate-related transitional risks, including the need to transition to lower emissions technology to
reduce the greenhouse gas emissions impact of our operations and supply chain in line with our goal of reducing our absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 30% by 2030
from our FY20 baseline. To address the technological challenges of transitioning to a low-carbon business model, we are investing in technologies that have the potential to
reduce the emissions of our products, such as our work with Natural Fiber Welding which led to the launch of the RLX CLARUS® Polo Shirt. This product marked the
unveiling of a first-to-market patented platform that transforms virgin and recycled cotton in ways previously not possible. The shirt featured a high-performance cotton that
performs similarly to plastic-based synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon, but without the use of petroleum-based fossil fuels.

(C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments?
Relevance
&
inclusion
Please explain
Current
regulation
Relevant,
always
included
Current regulations are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. An
example of a current regulatory risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is the move to low-Sulphur fuel oil (LSFO) across the
globe as mandated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and all its member countries. LSFO is a higher-grade fuel, so it costs more to refine and therefore could cause an
abrupt shift in energy costs, impacting our costs for shipping goods.
Emerging
regulation
Relevant,
always
included
Emerging regulations are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. An
example of an emerging regulatory risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is a potential carbon tax. Ralph Lauren may
become affected by carbon taxes and other pricing schemes that affect the cost of energy for facility operations and the cost of fuel for logistics.
Technology Relevant,
always
included
Technology risks are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. An example
of a technology risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is deploying technologies necessary for achieving our greenhouse
gas reduction commitments. We are investing in technologies that will allow us to reduce the carbon footprint of our products and supply chain in order to achieve our greenhouse gas
reduction target.
Legal
Relevant,
always
included
Legal risks are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. We have
monitored legal risks related to climate change, such as not adhering to climate laws, but we have not been affected by climate-related litigation.
Market
Relevant,
always
included
Market risks are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. An example of a
market risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is increased costs of raw materials. Chronic changes in weather can affect
the availability, quality, and price of the raw materials that Ralph Lauren depends on.
Reputation
Relevant,
always
included
Reputational risks are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. An example
of a reputational risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is perceived inaction on climate change. We have responded to this
risk by working to set meaningful commitments to combat climate change, including a science-based greenhouse gas reduction target and a commitment to source 100% renewable
electricity from our owned and operated facilities.
Acute
physical
Relevant,
always
included
Acute physical risks are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. An
example of an acute physical risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is business disruptions in our operations, sales
channels, and manufacturing and distribution networks as a result of increased severity of extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods.
Chronic
physical
Relevant,
always
included
Chronic physical risks are assessed as part of Ralph Lauren’s cross-functional Climate Risk Taskforce in developing and updating our Climate Risk Report on a semiannual basis. An
example of a chronic physical risk related to climate change that has been included within Ralph Lauren’s risk management process is reduced revenue from decreased production
capacity (e.g., transport difficulties, supply chain interruptions) as a result of changes in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns.

Company-specific description
Chronic changes in weather can affect the availability, quality, and price of the raw materials that Ralph Lauren depends on. One of the major raw materials in Ralph
Lauren’s products is cotton, which is a crop that is known to be affected by variation in annual rainfall and extreme precipitation, such as hail. This may impact the
communities and people that grow cotton, leading to a reduction in the supply of cotton and/or shifts in the key cotton-producing regions, which could affect material prices
and quality.

Explanation of financial impact figure
Our Climate Risk Taskforce evaluated the financial impact of this risk according to the financial impact criteria used in our corporate Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
process across four tiers of impact to our revenue and operating margin. This risk has been assigned the lowest financial impact category, with an estimated revenue impact
of less than $70 million. This estimate is based on our assessment of potential financial impacts from fluctuations in the cost of cotton. Recent internal analysis has shown
that we could see a 20-30% increase in the cost of cotton from overall market shifts. However, these market shifts have not translated to increases to our costs of goods
sold due to elements of our sourcing strategy mitigating this variability, including origin country shifts, and consolidation of materials and suppliers.
Cost of response to risk
Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
The financial impact of this risk can be mitigated through our sourcing strategy. This includes strategies to achieve balanced diversified country allocation, near shoring, and
localization of materials. We are working to consolidate our supply chain, with a goal for 80 percent of our business to be with strategic and key suppliers by 2025.

Company-specific description
We have operations, including retail, distribution, and warehousing operations, in locations subject to natural disasters, such as severe weather caused by climate change,
any of which could disrupt our operations. The occurrence of natural disasters or other catastrophic events may result in sudden disruptions in the business operations of
the local economies affected, as well as of the regional and global economies. Any of these events could result in decreased demand for our products and disruptions in our
sales channels and manufacturing and distribution networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Additionally, as storms become more severe and higher than average rainfall occurs as a result of climate change, the facilities operated by Ralph Lauren may have to
spend more to protect from storm-related damage and losses. Potential impacts associated with this risk include increased frequency weather events leading to business
disruption, expense and financial impact, costs to protect and retrofit existing facilities to be more resilient to extreme weather events. This also includes an increase in
philanthropic contributions to relief organizations in response to natural disasters that occur in countries where we operate.

Company-specific description
Ralph Lauren’s climate strategy includes development of low emission products and materials. We are currently using and aiming to increase the use of recycled content for
both synthetic and natural fibers, as well as cotton grown with less chemical inputs and irrigation water than conventional cotton. Our strategy also includes the use of
regeneratively grown fibers and materials to support carbon drawdown by healthy soils. In FY23, 89% of our units produced met at least one of our sustainable material
criteria—up from 77% in FY22. Last year we announced a comprehensive circularity strategy to further advance sustainability goals. We’re focused on using the principles
of Cradle to Cradle (C2C) as foundational inspiration for all aspects of design, development, manufacturing, packaging and the post-sale experience. Ralph Lauren has
been working closely with the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute to support the adoption of the latest version of the C2C standard and to provide apparel brand
perspective on its use. In FY23, we launched our C2C Certified® Gold Cashmere Sweater, an iconic product made to be worn, loved and live on responsibly for generations
to come. Available in Men’s Purple Label and Women’s Collection brands, the first-of-its-kind luxury crewneck cashmere sweater is the first of five iconic Ralph Lauren
products that we committed to have C2C Certified® by 2025. We plan to submit at least one additional product for certification in 2023. We will also continue to invest in
scalable technologies that will elevate the quality of recycled materials so that they are of the same high quality and feel as virgin material. In 2020, Ralph Lauren invested
in Natural Fiber Welding, a leading sustainable material science startup that is scaling a new industry standard for natural fiber recycling. As part of this commitment, Ralph
Lauren will produce 100% recycled cotton products across our portfolio by 2025. We continue to source innovative materials, including through NFW, to launch new
products. In March 2023, we released the POLO® MIRUM® sneaker and crossbody pouch. MIRUM® is a 100% plastic-free material, created without relying on
petrochemical and synthetic inputs. As we develop new and expanded circular and low emissions products, this could result in a competitive advantage, brand preference,
and brand loyalty among customers.

respect to these questions.
Row 1
Focal questions
In conducting scenario analysis, the focal question we are asking is - how should our corporate strategy and supporting investments change in response to potential climate
change scenarios? We have selected the scenarios described in question C3.2a to encompass physical and transition scenarios that address our highest priority climate
risks related to physical impacts to our facilities and supply chain and transition risks presented by carbon pricing and other regulations. We selected these scenarios to
ensure inclusion of multiple greater than 2 degrees aligned physical scenarios and multiple 2 degrees or lower transition scenarios.
Results of the climate-related scenario analysis with respect to the focal questions
The Ralph Lauren Climate Risk Taskforce has reviewed the results of our climate-related scenario analysis, has assessed how transition risks are potentially mitigated by
implementing our existing strategy, and is developing plans for adjusting our business strategy and financial planning to better address the physical and transition risks
under these scenarios. Based on this greater understanding of our focal question, in the next 12 months we are conducting an update to our greenhouse gas reduction
pathway analysis to assess the expected investment required to achieve our targets across various strategies and scenarios. This analysis will account for avoided carbon
pricing impacts of greenhouse gas reductions in our operations and supply chain. Additionally, the results of our climate-related scenario analysis of physical risks
quantified risk exposure at some of our largest owned and operated facilities and some priority supplier facilities. To identify specific actions to mitigate risks at these
facilities and to expand our understanding of potential risk exposure for a greater share of owned and operated and supplier facilities, we will be conducting an expanded
analysis of physical climate risks using scenario analysis in the next 12 months.

We take a holistic approach to sourcing preferred fibers and materials for our products, including the consideration of climate-related risks and opportunities. For example, we know that
supporting the increased supply of sustainably-grown, climate-resilient cotton on a global scale is imperative in order to meet our near-term 2025 goal of using 100% sustainably-sourced
cotton. This year we continued our transition to cotton qualities we recognize as sustainable, such as organic or Better Cotton. We also continued to support the growth of regenerative
cotton practices in the United States. The U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund (USRCF), run by the Soil Health Institute (SHI) and established through a founding grant from The Ralph
Lauren Corporate Foundation, is a unique, farmer-facing, science-based initiative housed at SHI that supports long-term, sustainable cotton production in the U.S. with a goal to
eliminate one million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent from the atmosphere by 2026. The Foundation’s founding contribution to USRCF has primarily supported work in four

Based on our assessment of our GHG emissions and climate risks within our supply chain, we established a roadmap to drive significant GHG reductions and risk mitigation in our
manufacturing supply chain. As part of this roadmap, in FY20, we launched our Supplier Engagement Strategy to establish and maintain collaborative relationships and systems that
foster increased transparency and accountability with our suppliers. Our sustainability expectations are included in the Supplier Engagement Strategy, which include considerations that
can be used in the future to mitigate risks from climate change in our supply base. For example, we strive for geographical diversity in our key and strategic suppliers, which will support
our efforts to mitigate the risk of disruptions in our supply chain from climate change. Helping our manufacturers achieve significant emissions reductions will be critical for achieving our
science-based GHG emissions target. We continued to invest in technical support for our partners to develop their decarbonization strategies and set targets and implementation plans
that align with the industry’s timeline and ambition level. We continue to partner with the Apparel Impact Institute (Aii) to roll out the Carbon Leadership Program within our supply chain.
We conducted a supply chain carbon emission analysis prior to the roll out to identify priority facilities to develop a decarbonization pathway. Through the Program, each manufacturing
facility is provided with technical support and toolkit to develop their bespoke 2025 and 2030 carbon and water reduction roadmaps and clear action plan with near-, medium- and long-
term priorities that align with the broader industry ambitions and best practices. We expanded our roll out of the Carbon Leadership Program to cover 48 facilities, representing
approximately 47% of our raw material business spend, and 19 strategic finished goods facilities. Nominated facilities set carbon reduction targets between 14% and 80% by 2030
against their 2019 baseline. The average reduction targets committed by all the nominated facilities so far is 59%. Based on the roadmaps developed by the nominated facilities, an

use efficiency, and prolong the life and durability of our products. These investments have the potential to lead to increased revenues resulting from cost savings as well as innovation in
sustainable customer offerings. Through the execution of our strategy of R&D investment, we expect to realize these opportunities in the medium-term (i.e., in the next two to five years).
This includes a minority investment in Natural Fiber Welding, Inc. (NFW), a leading sustainable material science startup that has revolutionized the reuse of natural fibers – such as
cotton waste – into patented, high-performance materials. Through this investment, we are looking to expand our use of recycled post-consumer cotton, helping to advance our progress
toward sustainable sourcing of 100% of our key materials, including cotton, by 2025 and integrating zero-waste principles across our business. The partnership has enabled us to begin
replacing and reducing our reliance on non-biodegradable synthetics, such as polyester and nylon, while scaling the use of more sustainable and upcycled materials. In FY23 we
debuted the POLO® MIRUM® sneaker—our first shoe made with MIRUM® components, a plant-based material from Natural Fiber Welding (NFW) that is 100% plastic-free. Created
without relying on petrochemical or synthetic inputs, the unique MIRUM® material for this sneaker uses a mixture of natural rubber, cotton, cork, plant oil, and plant wax.
Operations Yes
Ralph Lauren may become affected by carbon taxes and other pricing schemes that affect the cost of purchased electricity consumed at our offices, stores, and distribution centers. At
the same time, Ralph Lauren will need to deploy lower emissions technologies in order to achieve our greenhouse gas reduction commitments and to meet our commitment to source
100% renewable electricity in our direct operations by 2025 (i.e., in the next two years). This includes overcoming constraints in our facilities and lease arrangements to deploy energy
efficiency technologies and source renewable power. To mitigate potential increases in the costs non-renewable electricity and potential future carbon taxes applied to non-renewable
electricity consumption, we have developed a global strategy for sourcing renewable electricity across our owned and operated facilities and have begun engaging various teams
throughout our business to execute this strategy. A key aspect of our strategy will be signing one or more virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) in North America and Europe.
When fully implemented, these long-term agreements will provide us with renewable energy attribute certificates equivalent to the majority of our annual global electricity consumption in
those regions, mitigating the risk of carbon taxes from non-renewable electricity consumption. In evaluating and negotiating VPPAs throughout FY23, we convened our cross-functional
working group that draws on the perspective and expertise of members of our sustainability, procurement, legal, tax, treasury, accounting, and finance business functions. In 2022 and
2023, the contributions of the members of the working groups informed the definition of key commercial terms and go-to-market strategy for sourcing VPPAs in North America and
Europe, evaluation and selection of specific projects and developers, and negotiation of contract terms.

our commitment to source 100% renewable electricity in our direct operations by 2025 (i.e., in the next two years).
Capital allocation: To mitigate potential increases in the costs non-renewable electricity and potential future carbon taxes applied to non-renewable electricity consumption, we have
developed a global strategy for sourcing renewable electricity across our owned and operated facilities and have begun building these associated costs into our financial budgets.
Direct costs and Time horizons: A key aspect of our strategy will be signing one or more virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) in North America and Europe, a total of approximately
125,000 MWh per year. In evaluating VPPAs, our financial planning has considered the potential range of contract prices and expected monthly settlement prices to model anticipated costs
across the 10-to-15-year lifetime of the agreement across a range of market scenarios. As we implement this strategy and look towards signing our first VPPA in the coming year, we will fully
incorporate the anticipated financial performance of the selected project into our corporate budgets.

Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
In FY20, we established a science-based target to reduce our absolute GHG emissions by 30 percent by 2030, compared to 2020 levels. This target includes reducing
emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity and reducing emissions from our supply chain (scope 3). In June 2020, SBTi
verified that this target is aligned with GHG reductions required to keep global temperature rise to 1.5°C for Scope 1 and 2 and well below 2°C for Scope 3. Beyond 2030,
we intend to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2040. We have submitted our net zero target for SBTi approval and expect to complete the review and approval process in
2023. To accompany these commitments, we published a Net Zero Commitment Statement that details how we will achieve these targets. Please refer to 4.2c for more
information on our Net Zero target.
Ralph Lauren’s annual carbon footprints are aligned with our fiscal years. The baseline year of our science-based target is aligned with FY20, which ran from April 2019 to
March 2020. However, the target language of the SBTi specifies 2030 as the target year. Due to our reporting cycle being misaligned with the reporting year, we are aiming
to achieve our 2030 goal in our FY31 reporting, which will cover April 2030 to March 2031.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Achieving and sustaining our 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target will require adoption of low- and zero-carbon practices throughout our supply chain. As we develop and
refine our roadmap to achieving this goal, we have identified the strategies that will be most important to reach this target. These strategies include: Achieving and
maintaining our target of sourcing 100% renewable electricity at our facilities; increasing the share of low-carbon materials in our products (e.g., recycled fiber or
regenerative cotton farming practices); expanding and accelerating decarbonization practices with our product manufacturing suppliers, including supplier GHG reduction
roadmap development and coal phase-out; prioritizing ocean freight and minimizing air freight to transport our products; investing in our circularity strategy; and working with
partners and action networks for industry-wide change. Our absolute emissions decreased by 29% in FY23 from our FY20 baseline. This reduction is driven by production
volumes decreasing by 33% compared to FY20, which contributes significantly to our Scope 3 emissions from manufacturing and raw materials. Other factors contributing
to this change in emissions are reductions in air freight usage from FY22 levels, a shift in business travel practices, and regular improvements to our carbon footprint
methodology consistent with carbon accounting best practices. Specifically, we have made significant improvements around how we collect more comprehensive data from
suppliers to better reflect our manufacturing practices in our supply chain.

In FY20, we joined RE100 and committed to the goal of powering our owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100 percent renewable electricity by

energy strategy into action.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
In FY23, 8% of electricity used in our operations was from renewable sources, such as wind power. This is an increase from the share of renewable electricity used in
FY22 and represents renewable energy attribute certificate purchases in Europe. We continued to implement our renewables strategy in FY23 focused on virtual power
purchase agreements (VPPAs) in North America and Europe. For any remaining renewable electricity needs, we will source renewable energy credits (RECs) and
equivalent certificates.

Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
We have set a target to achieve net zero emissions across our value chain by 2040. In setting this target in 2021, we aligned our target with the 10 initial recommendations
defined in the Science Based Targets Initiative’s Foundations for Science-Based Net-Zero Target Setting In The Corporate Sector. We have submitted our net zero target
for SBTi approval and expect to complete the review and approval process in 2023. Upon completion of this review and approval process, we will update our target

Do you intend to neutralize any unabated emissions with permanent carbon removals at the target year?
Yes
Planned milestones and/or near-term investments for neutralization at target year
We believe nature-based climate solutions are a key part of a holistic net zero strategy. While we ramp up our use of regenerative and recycled materials, taking action now
to build capacity and supply of these fibers—through investment in our value chain and purchasing carbon removals—will be key to ensuring that fiber from regenerative
systems is available in the future. With over 80 percent of our products made of cotton, protecting and regenerating ecosystems will be core to our carbon removals
strategy. In selecting carbon removals projects, we will prioritize land-based interventions that help preserve and enhance carbon stocks both within and beyond our own
value chain. As we evaluate these projects, we will be looking at more than just the amount of carbon removed to ensure these interventions lead to: robust social and
environmental co-benefits, including preserving the biodiversity of local ecosystems and cultures as well as ensuring equitable access to natural resources; additional
removals that would otherwise not have occurred; permanent carbon storage with mitigation plans for leakage; quantifiable and unique removals that can be verified by an
accredited third-party. In FY23 we purchased our first credits from nature-based carbon removal projects. These projects provide incentives for newly adopted regenerative
farming practices, allowing farmers to earn income from verified carbon credits. By supporting financial incentives for U.S. growers to prioritize soil health and regenerative
practices, we believe we can accelerate progress toward our net zero commitments.

Cotton is the most widely used natural fiber for clothing production and accounts for more than 80% of our material use. We invest in the increased use of sustainable cotton and seek to support the
scaling of improved practices in cotton cultivation, which benefits our business, the environment and the farmers that grow it. In FY23, 94% of the cotton units we produced met at least one of our
defined sustainability attributes (organic, transitional/ in-conversion, Better Cotton, recycled, regenerative, U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol or Fair Trade).

In FY23, we continued our partnership with the Apparel Impact Institute to roll out the Carbon Leadership Program within our supply chain. We refreshed our supply chain carbon emissions analysis to
incorporate the emissions reduction targets and roadmaps developed in collaboration with our suppliers in the first cohort in FY22. We also continued to identify priority facilities and develop
decarbonization roadmaps for each. Through the Program, we invested in expert technical support for each manufacturing facility to develop their 2025 and 2030 carbon and water reduction plans in
alignment with broader industry ambitions and best practices. We also worked closely with our suppliers to track progress and support capability building and collective action programs. We plan to
continue expanding the program in our supply chain.

In FY23, we expanded the use of renewable energy in our operations, including increased renewable energy use in our retail stores and offices in Germany,
Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The formula used for calculating the percent reduction was (The change in emissions / previous year scope 1 & 2
emissions) x 100, or 4,177 MT CO2e / 80,873 MT CO2e x 100 = 5.16%.

The remaining decrease in emissions is not attributable to one particular reason. There were no changes in boundary or emission factor sources used, and
minor changes are expected year over year, for example to the data used or as emission factor methodologies improve. The formula used for calculating
the percent reduction was (The change in emissions / previous year scope 1 & 2 emissions) x 100, or 2,109 MT CO2e / 80,873 MT CO2e x 100 = 2.61%

We continued to implement our renewables strategy in FY23 focused on virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) in North America and Europe. We expect to sign our
first VPPA in FY24. In identifying and sourcing new-build solar projects and signing long-term power purchase agreements, we are directly contributing to bringing new
capacity into the grid in the regions where we operate. For any remaining renewable electricity needs, we will source renewable energy credits (RECs) and equivalent
certificates. We believe these purchases will indirectly contribute to bringing new capacity into the grid in the regions where we operate by sending a market signal about the
growing demand for renewable electricity.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) aims to achieve mutual, long-term, positive impacts across our supply chain. This requires enduring partnerships based on
transparency and trust. The SES provides a framework for us in building and maintaining these partnerships. It enables us to develop performance-based supply chain
segmentation, as well as drive continuous improvement and positive impact that are based on shared transparency, accountability and value creation. The SES and
supplier performance evaluation covers all suppliers globally. We communicate our expectations of responsible practices with all suppliers and seek feedback from our
strategic and key partners on their expectations on us as a responsible purchasing practice. We continue to progress towards our 2025 goal to conduct 80% of our
business with suppliers that meet the key and strategic supplier criteria which includes business, quality, citizenship and sustainability performance. In FY23, 54% of our
business was with suppliers that meet the key and strategic supplier criteria. Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) continues to focus on strengthening performance in
three key areas: business execution and partnership, citizenship and sustainability, and quality. Sustainability performance is a substantial contributor to the supplier’s
overall performance evaluation scorecard, which is used to inform business decisions and segmentation.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
Our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES) provides a framework for us to build and maintain mutual, long-term partnerships with our suppliers. The performance-based
supply chain segmentation takes into account the supplier’s performance in sustainability metrics, including climate, water stewardship, and sustainable chemicals
management. Our strategic and key supplier segments are held to a higher degree of expectations and are incentivized through growing business and transparency. We
rely on our partnership with the suppliers to drive reductions in our Scope 3 – manufacturing footprint to achieve our Science Based Target. We continue to invest in
programs and initiatives that support our supply partners in setting up and implementing sustainability and climate roadmap that aligns with or exceed our goals. We are
committed through the UNFCCC Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action to continuously pursue energy efficiency measures, coal phase-out, and renewable energy
adoption in our value chain. In FY23, we continued our partnership with the Apparel Impact Institute (aii) and expanded the roll out of Carbon Leadership Program to cover
48 facilities, representing approximately 47% of our raw material business spend, and 19 strategic finished goods facilities. Nominated facilities set carbon reduction targets
between 14% and 80% by 2030 against their 2019 baseline. The average reduction
targets committed by all the nominated facilities so far is 59%. Based on the roadmaps developed by the nominated facilities, an aggregated savings estimation of
1,792,905 tons of CO2 equivalent annually has been identified. Through the Program, we invested in technical support for each manufacturing facility to develop their
bespoke 2025 and 2030 carbon and water reduction roadmaps and clear action plan with near-, medium- and long-term priorities that align with the broader industry
ambitions and best practices.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
The success of our climate strategy requires engagement with our suppliers to reduce emissions throughout our supply chain. The first step to integrating our suppliers into
our strategy is to ensure they are complying with our code of conduct. Each supplier is required to sign our Vendor Compliance Packet (VCP) which details our code of
conduct. This legal document also features our sustainability policy. We incorporated our climate commitment into our supply chain and materials sustainability policy which
covers all suppliers and licensees.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
We are committed to a 30% reduction in absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by 2030 compared to a FY20 baseline. Through our Vendor Compliance Packet (VCP),
our suppliers are made aware of our sustainability policy, and are expected to comply with the requirements set therein as they sign the agreement. Since FY21, we
integrated citizenship and sustainability into our Supplier Engagement Strategy (SES), and launched our Vendor Management System (VMS), a database that enables us to
share information and opportunities with all tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers. As part of our Supplier Engagement Strategy, we integrated citizenship and sustainability into our
supplier evaluation scorecard, where sustainable materials, chemical management, water stewardship, and climate performance now sit alongside other business-critical
issues such as quality.

Through our Vendor Compliance Packet, we set a clear expectation that all facilities manufacturing Ralph Lauren products and materials track and report their
environmental and climate impact data via the Higg Index Facilities Environment Module (FEM) on an annual basis. We continued to engage closely with our Tier 1 and
Tier 2 suppliers through the Higg Index FEM. We also rolled out third-party verification of the FEM data in accordance with protocols set by the Sustainable Apparel
Coalition (SAC). While we require all suppliers to share Higg FEM verified data with us, in FY23, 56% of the active factories representing 90% of total business spend had
shared their data with us, including our strategic and key suppliers. We continue to invest in efforts to increase visibility to our supply chain climate and environmental data
through expanding the adoption of Higg FEM and third party verification in partnership with the SAC and Higg Co.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
We are committed to the industry’s collective effort to increase visibility of environmental and climate data monitoring and drive the adoption of manufacturing best practices.
Through the Higg Index Facility Environmental Module (FEM), we gain visibility to our supplier’s environmental data on an annual basis. The data is used to monitor our
footprint and progress made over time. In FY23, We collected Higg FEM data from 270 Tier 1 facilities, representing 90% of our supply chain spend. Among the reporting
facilities, 255 facilities (89.7% of business spend) have completed data verification by an SAC approved verifier. Facilities scored an average of 53 points across all
sections, with an average of 68 points in the water section, 31 points in chemical management section and 77 in the energy section. In FY23, the expanded FEM rollout also
covered 186 mills, a significant increase from 50 facilities last year, representing an estimated 78% (54% in FY22) of our woven, knit, and sweater yarn production. A total of
178 mills (48 in FY22) have completed data verification, with an average score of 58 points across all sections. The mills scored on average 84 points in the energy section,

Please explain the rationale for selecting this group of customers and scope of engagement
The use and end-of-life treatment of our sold products contribute approximately 17% of our overall Scope 3 carbon footprint. Our circularity strategy aims to reduce those
emissions by offering our customers innovative products and experiences.
In June 2022 we announced our new Live On promise to enable our past and future products to live on responsibly by 2030. The Ralph Lauren Live On promise builds on
the Company’s existing circularity strategy and is supported by three foundational pillars that guide initial goals:
(1) Design for Circularity: Ralph Lauren has committed to designing our products according to circular principles by 2025, including a goal to make five iconic products C2C
Certified®. In addition, we will offer high quality products made with 100% recycled cotton.
(2) Enable Circular Consumer Experiences: We have committed to extend the life of our products by piloting ways for its consumers to rent, repair, and recirculate Ralph
Lauren products by 2025, in select top cities.
(3) Advance the Circular Economy: By 2025, we will also invest in scaling regenerative practices – such as the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund – and innovative
technologies like those produced by Natural Fiber Welding, a leading sustainable material science startup that is scaling a new industry standard for natural fiber recycling.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
The impact of this engagement will be measured based on our progress towards achieving the initial goals of our Live On promise. For example, we have committed to
designing our products according to circular principles by 2025, including a goal to make five iconic products C2C Certified®. In FY23 we introduced The Cradle to Cradle

(C12.1d) Give details of your climate-related engagement strategy with other partners in the value chain.
 We regularly engage with our peers and other organizations through collaborative projects and programs to leverage collective action to address climate change impacts in
our value chain. In particular, we have focused on collaborative initiatives to reduce emissions from our raw materials sourcing, manufacturing, and processing, and
transportation and distribution, as these comprise the largest sources of emissions in our value chain. This year, we were actively involved in a number of initiatives driving
collective action to address climate change impacts in our value chain, including the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, Apparel Impact Institute, UN Fashion Industry Charter for
Climate Action, and the G7 Fashion Pact. 
Through engagement with these initiatives, we have come to better understand that our actions alone are not enough to address climate-related strategies throughout our
value chain. For example, as signatories to the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, we have committed to establishing a decarbonization pathway and
continuously pursue coal phase-out, energy efficiency measures and renewable energy in our value chain, including suppliers in the North America, Latin America, EMEA,
and APAC regions. The challenge we face, along with our fellow Fashion Charter signatories, is finding efficient and effective methods for decarbonization in our supply
chain, including with suppliers where we are one of several customers. Building off the Fashion Charter’s guidance for supply chain decarbonization, we analyzed our GHG
emissions and climate risks within our supply chain and established a roadmap to drive significant GHG reductions in our manufacturing. It has become clear that in order to
deliver on our ambitious roadmap, we need to work closely with our suppliers to align their climate agenda, focus, and priorities with ours. 
As a result of this analysis and engagement with the Fashion Charter and the Apparel Impact Institute, we are drawing on guidance and programs from these partners to
support our suppliers in establishing an energy and carbon reduction strategy and roadmap. We expect that these suppliers’ strategies will be crucial in ensuring we achieve
our target of a 30% reduction in absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by 2030 compared to a FY20 baseline. 
We are therefore expanding our collaboration with suppliers through collective action programs that accelerate the standardized approach to setting carbon targets and low-
carbon action plans at the factory level and help them build capability to implement them. We believe this will further empower our supply partners to establish and implement
climate strategies aligned with our climate objectives. Facilities representing approximately 47% of our raw material business spend has been engaged in the collective action
programs by Apparel Impact Institute so far and we will continue expanding the adoption of the collective action programs in our value chain. We are also working to identify
opportunities to accelerate the elimination of coal across our industry. In FY23, we launched our accelerated roadmap to eliminate coal in our value chain aiming to eliminate
coal as soon as possible. We analyzed the usage of coal in our supply base, and start engaging the on-site coal using facilities to develop a concrete coal elimination
roadmap. We continue to monitor the evolving infrastructure and policy developments in our sourcing geographies, while collaborating closely with our peers and partners in
the industry to drive action on coal elimination in our shared supply chains.

Climate-related requirement
Complying with regulatory requirements
Description of this climate related requirement
We explicitly state in our Vendor Compliance and Operating Standards that all suppliers are required to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations of the regions where
they operate, including, but not limited to, the local environmental standards. We have the right to terminate our business relationship should the supplier fail to comply with
the applicable laws and regulations. In addition to that, we are screening our supply base for any potential significant environmental impacts through the Higg Index Facility
Environmental Module and the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) Supervision platform (the latter is specific to China-based facilities). If an issue is found, we
require the supplier to take corrective action and put in place preventive measures to avoid recurrence. Specifically, on any violation record found on the IPE platform, we
also require the facilities—at a minimum—to publish enterprise feedback onto the platform, which details the corrective and preventive measures taken.
In FY23, we screened all our Tier 1, subcontracted processing and top mills through these platforms. We identified 9 facilities with potential significant environmental
impacts related to industrial wastewater, permits and air emissions. We do not use Higg FEM assessment results or IPE records to terminate business relationships with
suppliers. We addressed all the identified facilities to ensure corrective action and preventive measures are in place.

Climate-related disclosure through a non-public platform
Description of this climate related requirement
Through our Vendor Compliance Packet, we set a clear expectation that all facilities manufacturing Ralph Lauren products and materials track and report their
environmental and climate impact data via the Higg Index Facilities Environment Module (FEM) on an annual basis. We continued to engage closely with our Tier 1 and
Tier 2 suppliers through the Higg Index FEM. We also rolled out third-party verification of the FEM data in accordance with protocols set by the Sustainable Apparel
Coalition (SAC). While we require all suppliers to share Higg FEM verified-data with us, in FY23, the active factories representing 90% of total business spend had shared
their data with us, including our strategic and key suppliers. We continue to invest in efforts to increase visibility to our supply chain climate and environmental data through
expanding the adoption of Higg FEM and third party verification in partnership with the SAC and Higg Co.

Ralph Lauren believes that the United States must play a leading role in the transition to a low-carbon world. The United States’ recent commitment to reduce emissions by
50-52% by 2030 is an important step on the pathway to achieving net-zero GHG emissions by no later than 2050 and of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. However, to
achieve this commitment and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, there is a need for strong federal climate policies. Our stance on US climate policy action can be found
attached to this question.

Ralph Lauren was pleased to see the SEC’s proposed rules for climate-related disclosures as introduced in March 2022 and we are supportive of requirements for
disclosing data points that are measurable, quantifiable, widely reported, and widely used. In June 2022 we submitted a comment to SEC Chair Gary Gensler
communicating our support for the proposed rule.
Ralph Lauren supports policies that support and advance our sustainability efforts to deliver the changes that will help reduce our climate impact and create a more
sustainable future for generations. We actively support reporting on emissions, climate risks and energy transition activities in a manner that is relevant, accurate,
transparent and consistent. We provide information on ESG in annual reports that follow the voluntary approaches, frameworks, and priorities recommended by and
contained in reporting frameworks such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), CDP, International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), and
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

Representing more than 1,000 brands, the American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA) is a public policy and political voice of the apparel and footwear industry, its
management and shareholders, its four million U.S. workers, and its contribution of $384 billion in annual U.S. retail sales. The AAFA holds that the best way to reduce
carbon emissions and therefore climate change is to pursue multilateral negotiations that would shape a post-Kyoto approach to global climate change policy.
Ralph Lauren’s Chief Product Officer is currently a member of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors for AAFA and, as part of that role, participates in
discussions of how AAFA supports apparel and footwear industry in addressing sustainability and climate change. During FY23, we worked with AAFA to develop a position
on the California Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (SB 253), advocating our support for the bill to require public disclosure of companies’ Scope 1, 2, and 3
emissions.

Business Roundtable has supported, and continues to support, more transparent and comparable climate-related disclosures with regard to the material risks and business
opportunities associated with climate change. In 2020, Business Roundtable announced support for the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and a suite of policies to help
achieve those goals. As part of that statement, Business Roundtable noted the following about the role of disclosure: “American corporations must continue to lead the way
in driving efficiency, advancing a spectrum of low to negative emissions technologies and reducing GHG emissions. Many companies seek to be transparent around their
approaches and progress toward those goals. It is important for companies to continue to engage on, and disclose when appropriate, material risks that may be driven by
climate change as well as the business opportunities associated with advancing low-carbon solutions. Effective disclosures should focus on the company’s approach to risk
management and its connection to the company’s strategy and governance. These disclosures should be voluntary, and industry supported and should consider leading
disclosure frameworks.”
In response to the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s proposed rule “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors”, we have
engaged directly with Business Roundtable to provide feedback on the organization’s comments on the proposed rule. Our perspective differs from Business Roundtable on
certain aspects of the proposed rule, including the importance of quantifying and disclosing corporate scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. We have encouraged Business
Roundtable to support the inclusion of scope 3 greenhouse gas reporting requirements in the final rule.
