PART I
Item 1.    Business.
General
Founded in 1967 by Mr. Ralph Lauren, we are a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including
apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, fragrances, and hospitality. For more than 50 years, Ralph Lauren has sought to inspire the dream of a better
life through authenticity and timeless style. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products, brands,
distribution channels, and international markets. We believe that our global reach, breadth of lifestyle product offerings, and multi-channel distribution are
unique among luxury and apparel companies.
We diversify our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and
licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or
channel of distribution. We sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-
shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-
party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which we have licensed the right to operate in defined geographic
territories using our trademarks. In addition, we license to third parties for specified periods the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the
licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.
We organize our business into the following three reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to these reportable segments, we
also have other non-reportable segments. See "Our Segments" for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.
Our global reach is extensive, as we sell directly to customers throughout the world via our 504 retail stores and 684 concession-based shop-within-
shops, as well as through our own digital commerce sites and those of various third-party digital partners. Merchandise is also available through our
wholesale distribution channels at approximately 9,000 doors worldwide,

================================================================================
the majority in specialty stores, as well as through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers. In addition to our directly-operated stores
and shops, our international licensing partners operate 148 stores and shops.
We have been controlled by the Lauren family since the founding of our Company. As of April 2, 2022, Mr. R. Lauren, or entities controlled by the
Lauren family, held approximately 85% of the voting power of the Company's outstanding common stock.
Objectives and Opportunities
Our purpose is to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. We believe that our size and the global scope of our
operations provide us with design, sourcing, and distribution synergies across our business. Our core strengths include a portfolio of global premium lifestyle
brands, a well-diversified global multi-channel distribution network, an investment philosophy supported by a strong balance sheet, and an experienced
management team. Despite the various risks and uncertainties associated with the current global economic environment, as discussed further in
Item 7 — "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Global Economic Conditions and Industry Trends,"
we believe our core strengths will allow us to execute our long-term growth strategy.
An overview of our long-term growth strategy is presented below:

volunteerism and our dedication to social and environmental causes.
•
Worker Empowerment and Well-being — We are committed to conducting our global operations ethically and with respect for the dignity of all
people who make our products. We aim to enrich the quality of work and life for everyone in our supply chain, ensuring they all have the
opportunity to reach their full potential in a safe and inclusive environment.
Additional information relating to Design the Change can be found in our annual sustainability reports, which is available at our website at

Factors — Risks Related to Environmental, Social, and Governance Issues."
Recent Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic
Beginning in the fourth quarter of our Fiscal 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19 emerged and spread rapidly
across the globe, including throughout all major geographies in which we operate, resulting in adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well
as significant volatility in global financial markets. Since then, governments worldwide have periodically imposed varying degrees of preventative and
protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such
factors, among others, have resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. Additionally, companies
across a wide array of industries have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating expenses and preserve cash balances during the pandemic,
including work furloughs, reduced pay, and severance actions, which could lower consumers' disposable income levels or willingness to purchase
discretionary items. Such government restrictions, company initiatives, and other macroeconomic impacts resulting from the pandemic could continue to
adversely affect consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences, such as willingness to congregate in indoor shopping centers or other
populated locations.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of our stores, distribution
centers, and corporate facilities, as have our wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 at the
peak of the pandemic, the majority of our stores in key markets were closed for an average of 8 to 10 weeks due to government-mandated lockdowns and
other restrictions, resulting in significant adverse impacts to our operating results. Resurgences and outbreaks in certain parts of the world resulted in further
business disruptions periodically throughout Fiscal 2021, most notably in Europe where a significant number of our stores were closed for approximately two
to three months during the second half of Fiscal 2021, including during the holiday period, due to government-mandated lockdowns and other restrictions.
Such disruptions continued throughout Fiscal 2022 in certain regions, although to a lesser extent than the comparable prior year fiscal period. Further,
throughout the course of the pandemic, the majority of our stores that were able to remain open have periodically been subject to limited operating hours
and/or customer capacity levels in accordance with local health guidelines, with traffic remaining challenged. However, our digital commerce operations have
grown significantly from pre-pandemic levels, due in part to our investments and enhanced capabilities, as well as changes in consumer shopping preferences.
Our wholesale and licensing businesses have experienced similar impacts, particularly in North America and Europe.
The COVID-19 pandemic also continues to adversely impact our distribution, logistic, and sourcing partners, including temporary factory closures,
labor shortages, vessel, container and other transportation shortages, and port congestion. Such disruptions have reduced the availability of inventory, delayed
timing of inventory receipts, and resulted in increased costs for the both the purchase and transportation of such inventory.
Throughout the course of the pandemic, our priority has been to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and the communities in
which we operate around the world. We continue to consider the guidance of local governments and global health organizations and have implemented new
health and safety protocols in our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities. We also took various preemptive actions in the prior fiscal year to
preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position, as described in the Fiscal 2021 10-K. Such actions included, but were not limited to, issuing $1.250
billion of unsecured senior notes, temporarily suspending our quarterly cash dividend and common stock repurchase programs, temporarily reducing the base
compensation of our executives and senior management team, and temporarily furloughing or reducing work hours for a significant portion of our employees.
Despite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines and improvements in the global economy as a whole during Fiscal 2022, the pandemic remains
volatile and continues to evolve, including the emergence of variants of the virus, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, which has and could continue to
adversely affect consumer sentiment and confidence. Accordingly, we cannot predict for how long and to what extent the pandemic will continue to impact
our business operations or the overall global economy. We will continue to assess our operations location-by-location, considering the guidance of local
governments and global health organizations.
See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions — Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could
have a material adverse effect on our business" for additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan
We have undertaken efforts to realign our resources to support future growth and profitability, and to create a sustainable, enhanced cost structure. The
key initiatives underlying these efforts involve evaluation of our: (i) team organizational structures and ways of working; (ii) real estate footprint and related
costs across our corporate offices, distribution centers, and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors; and (iii) brand portfolio.
In connection with the first initiative, on September 17, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the "Fiscal 2021 Strategic
Realignment Plan") to reduce our global workforce. Additionally, during a preliminary review of our store portfolio during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021,
we made the decision to close our Polo store on Regent Street in London.
Shortly thereafter, on October 29, 2020, we announced the planned transition of our Chaps brand to a fully licensed business model, consistent with our
long-term brand elevation strategy and in connection with our third initiative. Specifically, we have entered into a multi-year licensing partnership, which
took effect on August 1, 2021 following a transition period, with an affiliate of 5 Star Apparel LLC, a division of the OVED Group, to manufacture, market,
and distribute Chaps menswear and womenswear. The products are being sold at existing channels of distribution with opportunities for expansion into
additional channels and markets globally. This agreement has created incremental value for the Company by enabling an even greater focus on elevating our
core brands in the marketplace, reducing our direct exposure to the North America department store channel, and setting up Chaps to deliver on its potential
with an experienced partner that is focused on nurturing the brand.
Later, on February 3, 2021, our Board of Directors approved additional actions related to our real estate initiative. Specifically, we are in the process of
further rightsizing and consolidating our global corporate offices to better align with our organizational profile and new ways of working. We also have
closed, and may continue to close, certain of our stores to improve overall profitability. Additionally, we further consolidated our North America distribution
centers in order to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability, and deliver a better consumer experience.
Finally, on June 26, 2021, in connection with our brand portfolio initiative, we sold our former Club Monaco business to Regent, L.P. ("Regent"), a
global private equity firm, with no resulting gain or loss on sale realized during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. Regent acquired Club Monaco's assets and
liabilities in exchange for potential future cash consideration payable to us, including earn-out payments based on Club Monaco meeting certain defined
revenue thresholds over a five-year period. Accordingly, we may realize amounts in the future related to the receipt of such contingent consideration.
Additionally, in connection with this divestiture, we are providing Regent with certain operational support for a transitional period of approximately one year,
varying by functional area.
In connection with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan, we have recorded cumulative pre-tax charges of $262.1 million, of which $25.3 million
and $236.8 million were recorded during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan were
substantially completed by the end of Fiscal 2022, with certain remaining actions expected to be completed during Fiscal 2023. We now expect total charges
of up to $300 million to be incurred in connection with this plan, consisting of cash-related charges of approximately $180 million and non-cash charges of
approximately $120 million. Actions associated with this plan are expected to result in gross annualized pre-tax expense savings of approximately $200
million, a portion of which is being reinvested back into the business.
See Note 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal
2021 Strategic Restructuring Plan.

Our Segments
We organize our business into the following three reportable segments:
•
North America — Our North America segment, representing approximately 48% of our Fiscal 2022 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of
our Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through our retail and wholesale
businesses in the U.S. and Canada. In North America, our retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores,
and our digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.com. Our wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department
stores and, to a lesser extent, specialty stores.
•
Europe — Our Europe segment, representing approximately 28% of our Fiscal 2022 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph
Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in
Europe and emerging markets. In Europe, our retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, our
concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites. Our wholesale business in Europe is comprised primarily of a
varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital partners.
•
Asia — Our Asia segment, representing approximately 21% of our Fiscal 2022 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren

No operating segments were aggregated to form our reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable
segments, representing approximately 3% of our Fiscal 2022 net revenues, which primarily consist of Ralph Lauren and Chaps branded royalty revenues
earned through our global licensing alliances. In addition, prior to its disposition at the end of our first quarter of Fiscal 2022, our other non-reportable
segments also included sales of Club Monaco branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and our
licensing alliances in Asia. Refer to "Recent Developments" for additional discussion regarding the disposition of our former Club Monaco business, as well
as the recent transition of our Chaps business to a fully licensed business model.
This segment structure is consistent with how we establish our overall business strategy, allocate resources, and assess performance of our Company.

approximately 4.0 million and 0.7 million square feet, respectively, as well as through our own digital commerce sites and those of various third-party digital
partners. We operate our business using a global omni-channel retailing strategy that seeks to deliver an integrated shopping experience with a consistent
message of our brands and products to our customers, regardless of whether they are shopping for our products in physical stores or online. We also continue
to scale and expand our Connected Retail capabilities to enhance the consumer experience, which now include virtual selling appointments, Buy Online-Pick
Up in Store, and mobile checkout and contactless payments, among other capabilities.
Ralph Lauren Stores
Our Ralph Lauren stores feature a broad range of apparel, footwear, accessories, watch and jewelry, fragrance, and home product assortments in an
atmosphere reflecting the distinctive attitude and image of the Ralph Lauren, Polo, and Double RL brands, including exclusive merchandise that is not sold in
department stores. During Fiscal 2022, we opened 31 new Ralph Lauren stores and closed 7 stores. Our Ralph Lauren stores are primarily situated in major
upscale street locations and upscale regional malls, generally in large urban markets.

season products.

Concession-based Shop-within-Shops
The terms of trade for shop-within-shops are largely conducted on a concession basis, whereby inventory continues to be owned by us (not the
department store) until ultimate sale to the end consumer. The salespeople involved in the sales transactions are generally our employees and not those of the
department store.
The following table presents the number of concession-based shop-within-shops by segment as of April 2, 2022:

     Our concession-based shop-within-shops were located at approximately 320 retail locations.
The size of our concession-based shop-within-shops ranges from approximately 100 to 4,200 square feet. We may share in the cost of building out
certain of these shop-within-shops with our department store partners.
Directly-Operated Digital Commerce Websites
In addition to our stores, our retail business sells products online in North America, Europe, and Asia through our various directly-operated digital
commerce sites, which include www.RalphLauren.com, among others. We continue to expand accessibility to our digital flagships globally while localizing
language, currencies, payment methods, product assortments, and content. We also sell our products online through various third-party digital partner
commerce sites, primarily in Asia, as well as through our mobile apps in North America and in the United Kingdom.
Our Ralph Lauren digital commerce sites offer our customers access to a broad array of Ralph Lauren, Polo, Lauren, and Double RL apparel, footwear,
accessories, watch and jewelry, fragrance, and home product assortments, and reinforce the luxury image of our brands. While investing in digital commerce
operations remains a primary focus, it is an extension of our investment in the integrated omni-channel strategy used to operate our overall retail business, in
which our digital commerce operations are interdependent with our physical stores.
Our Wholesale Business
Our wholesale business sells our products globally primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and golf and pro shops, as well as to various
third-party digital partners. We have continued to focus on elevating our brand by improving in-store product assortment and presentation, as well as full-
price sell-throughs to consumers. As of the end of Fiscal 2022, our wholesale products were sold through approximately 9,000 doors worldwide, with the
majority in specialty stores. Our products are also increasingly being sold through the digital commerce sites of many of our traditional wholesale customers
and our third-party digital partners.
The primary product offerings sold through our wholesale channels of distribution include apparel, footwear, accessories, and home furnishings. Our
luxury brands, including Ralph Lauren Collection and Ralph Lauren Purple Label, are distributed worldwide through a limited number of premier fashion
retailers. In North America, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, and to a lesser extent, specialty stores. In Europe, our
wholesale business is comprised primarily of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to
various third-party digital partners. In Asia, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, with related products distributed
through shop-within-shops. We also distribute our wholesale products to certain licensed stores operated by our partners in Latin America, Asia, Europe, and
the Middle East.
We sell most of our excess and out-of-season products through secondary distribution channels worldwide, including our retail factory stores.

Worldwide Wholesale Distribution Channels

Doors
North America
3,373 
Europe
5,184 
Asia
446 
Total
9,003 
In addition to our conventional wholesale doors, our products are increasingly being sold through the websites of many of our traditional wholesale
customers, as well as those of our third-party digital partners. As of April 2, 2022, our wholesale business served approximately 100 third-party digital
partners, primarily in Europe.
We have three key wholesale customers that generate significant sales volume. During Fiscal 2022, sales to our three largest wholesale customers
accounted for approximately 16% of our total net revenues. Substantially all sales to our three largest wholesale customers related to our North America
segment.
Our products are sold primarily by our own sales forces. Our wholesale business maintains its primary showrooms in New York City, as well as
regional showrooms in London, Madrid, Milan, Munich, Paris, and Stockholm. In addition, we utilize virtual showrooms, allowing our customers to
experience and discover our product assortments in a retail setting remotely.
Shop-within-Shops.    As a critical element of our distribution to department stores, we and our licensing partners utilize shop-within-shops to enhance
brand recognition, to permit more complete merchandising of our lines by the department stores, and to differentiate the presentation of our products.
The following table presents by segment the number of shop-within-shops in our primary channels of distribution as of April 2, 2022:
Shop-within-Shops
North America
7,191 
Europe
6,640 
Asia
621 
Total
14,452 
The size of our shop-within-shops ranges from approximately 85 to 9,200 square feet. Shop-within-shop fixed assets primarily include items such as
customized freestanding fixtures, wall cases and components, decorative items, and flooring. We normally share in the cost of building out these shop-within-
shops with our wholesale customers.
Replenishment Program.    Core products such as knit shirts, chino pants, oxford cloth shirts, select footwear and accessories, and home products can
be ordered by our wholesale customers at any time through our replenishment program. We generally ship these products within two to five days of order
receipt.
Backlog.    We generally receive wholesale orders approximately three to five months prior to the time the products are delivered to customers, except
for orders received through our replenishment program which ship within two to five days of order receipt. Our wholesale orders are generally subject to
broad cancellation rights. Further, the size of our order backlog depends on several factors, including the timing of the market weeks for our particular lines
during which a significant percentage of our orders are received and the timing of shipments, which varies from year-to-year with consideration for holidays,
consumer trends, concept plans, and the replenishment program's usage. Consequently, the dollar amount of our backlog as of any date may not be indicative
of actual future shipments and therefore is not meaningful in understanding our business as a whole.

Our Licensing Business
Through licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight, design, and marketing skills with the specific product or geographic competencies of
our licensing partners to create and build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners who are leaders in their respective markets, contribute the
majority of product development costs, provide the operational infrastructure required to support the business, and own the inventory. Our licensing business
has been aggregated with other non-reportable segments.
Product Licensing
We grant our product licensees the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated
products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings. Each product licensing partner pays us royalties based upon its sales of our
products, generally subject to a minimum royalty requirement for the right to use our trademarks and design services. In addition, our licensing partners may
be required to allocate a portion of their revenues to advertising our products and sharing in the creative costs associated with these products. Larger
allocations typically are required in connection with launches of new products or in new territories. Our license agreements generally have two to five-year
terms and may grant the licensees conditional renewal options.
We work closely with all of our licensing partners to ensure that their products are developed, marketed, and distributed to reach the intended consumer
and are presented consistently across product categories to convey the distinctive identity and lifestyle associated with our brands. Virtually all aspects of the
design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising, and promotion of Ralph Lauren products are subject to our prior approval and
continuing oversight. We perform a broader range of services for most of our Ralph Lauren Home licensing partners than we do for our other licensing
partners, including design, operating showrooms, marketing, and advertising.
The following table lists our largest licensing agreements as of April 2, 2022 for the product categories presented. Except as noted in the table, these
product licenses cover North America only.

================================================================================
Digital Ecosystem
Investing in our digital ecosystem remains a primary focus and is a key component of our integrated global omni-channel strategy that spans across
owned and partnered channels, both physical and digital. Our digital ecosystem is comprised of directly-operated platforms, wholesale partner websites, third-
party digital pure players, social commerce, and virtual economy platforms.
Our directly-operated digital commerce sites represent our digital flagships, featuring the most elevated expression of our brands. The strategy for our
digital flagships is to deliver distinct and immersive brand experiences, continuously enhance consumer experience, and develop digital content that drives
deeper consumer engagement and conversion. Our physical flagships are also brought to life in a digital format through our virtual store experience, allowing
consumers to experience our brands and product assortments in a way that was previously only possible by walking into our stores. In connection with our
long-term growth strategy, we also continue to scale and expand our Connected Retail capabilities to enhance the consumer experience, which now include
virtual selling appointments, Buy Online-Pick Up in Store, and mobile checkout and contactless payments, among other capabilities.
Our products are also sold through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers across the globe. With all partners in our ecosystem,
we seek to showcase the brand consistently with our values. We collaborate with our key wholesale customers to deliver the right content to the right
audience, and leverage consumer insights to develop a holistic, channel-agnostic view of our consumer.
We also sell our products online through various third-party digital pure-play sites to reach a broader audience of consumers, including younger
consumers, and amplify our brand messages. On many of these sites, we have created digital shop-in-shop environments with a consistent brand experience,
tailored product stories, and an assortment that is carefully curated by our merchants. We also partner closely with our pure-play customers on marketing
content and events, as well as optimizing search and other data analyses to drive higher traffic and conversion for our brands.
In connection with our digital commerce operations, we engage consumers through various digital and social media platforms, which are supported
through our collaboration with influencers who have an authentic connection to our brand. Ralph Lauren brands are also represented in several virtual
economy platforms, providing digital apparel offerings and virtual brand experiences in the metaverse that attract younger consumers.
Seasonality of Business
Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale sales
in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods
impacting our retail business and timing of seasonal wholesale shipments. As a result of changes in our business, consumer spending patterns, and the
macroeconomic environment, including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events, historical quarterly operating trends and
working capital requirements may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating income, and cash flows in any
fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns.
Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital requirements typically increase during the first half of the fiscal year as
inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling periods and, accordingly, typically decrease during the second half of the fiscal year as inventory is
shipped/sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the second half of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements during
that period.
Product Design
Our products reflect a timeless and innovative interpretation of American style with a strong international appeal. Our consistent emphasis on new and
distinctive design has been an important contributor to the prominence, strength, and reputation of the Ralph Lauren brands.
Our Ralph Lauren products are designed by, and under the direction of, Mr. Ralph Lauren and our design staff. We form design teams around our
brands and product categories to develop concepts, themes, and products for each brand and category. Through close collaboration with merchandising, sales,
and product management staff, these teams support all of our businesses in order to gain market information and other valuable input.

================================================================================
Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing and advertising programs communicate the themes and images of our brands and are integral to the success of our product offerings.
The majority of our advertising programs are created and executed by our in-house creative and advertising agency to ensure consistency of presentation,
which is complemented by our marketing experts in each region who help to execute our international strategies.
We create distinctive image advertising for our brands, conveying the particular message of each one within the context of the overall Ralph Lauren
aesthetic. Advertisements generally portray a lifestyle rather than a specific item and include a variety of products offered by us and, in some cases, our
licensing partners. Our communication campaigns are increasingly being executed through digital and social media platforms to drive further engagement
with the younger consumer. With regard to influencers, we believe in fostering long-term relationships with those who have an authentic connection to our
brand and influence the areas of culture that matter most to our audiences. We also continue to advertise through print and outdoor media, and, to a lesser
extent, through television and cinema.
Our digital advertising programs focus on high impact and innovative digital media outlets, which allow us to convey our key brand messages and
lifestyle positioning. We also develop digital editorial initiatives that allow for deeper education and engagement around the Ralph Lauren lifestyle. We
deploy these marketing and advertising initiatives through online, mobile, video, email, and social media. Our digital commerce sites present the Ralph
Lauren lifestyle online, while offering a broad array of our apparel, footwear, accessories, and home product lines.
Additionally, we advertise in consumer and trade publications, and participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with some of our retail
and licensing partners. We have outdoor advertising placements in key cities as well, focusing on impact and reach. We also provide point-of-sale fixtures and
signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation of our products at their retail locations. In addition, when our licensing partners are required
to spend an amount equal to a percentage of their licensed product sales on advertising, in certain cases we coordinate the advertising placement on their
behalf. We believe our investments in shop-within-shop environments and retail stores, including our global flagship locations, contribute to and enhance the
themes of our brands to consumers.
We also conduct a variety of public relations activities. For example, we typically introduce each of our spring and fall menswear and womenswear
collections at press presentations in major cities such as New York City and Milan. Such fashion events, in addition to celebrity red carpet dressing moments
and events hosted in our stores and restaurants, including The Polo Bar in New York City, generate extensive domestic and international media and social
coverage.
We are the official outfitter for all on-court officials at the Wimbledon, U.S.  Open, and Australian Open tennis tournaments. These tournaments
provide worldwide exposure for our brand in a relevant lifestyle environment. We also continue to be the exclusive Official Parade Outfitter for the U.S.
Olympic and Paralympic Teams, with the right to manufacture, distribute, advertise, promote, and sell products in the U.S. which replicate the Parade Outfits
and associated leisure wear. Most recently, we dressed Team U.S.A. for the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, China in 2022 and the Summer Olympic
Games in Tokyo, Japan in 2021. As part of our involvement with Team U.S.A., we have established a partnership with athletes serving as brand ambassadors
and as the faces of our advertising, marketing, and public relations campaigns. We are also the official apparel outfitter for the Professional Golfers'
Association ("PGA") of America, the PGA Championship, the U.S. Golf Association, and the U.S. Ryder Cup Team, as well as a partner of the American
Junior Golf Association. We sponsor a roster of professional golfers, including Billy Horschel, Andrea Lee, Nick Watney, Smylie Kaufman, Tom Watson,
Davis Love III, Jonathan Byrd, and Doc Redman.
We believe our partnerships with such prestigious global athletic events reinforce our brand's sporting heritage in a truly authentic way and serve to
connect our Company and brands to our consumers through their individual areas of passion.
Sourcing, Production and Quality
We contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own or operate any production facilities. Over 300 different manufacturers worldwide
produce our apparel, footwear, accessories, and home products, with no one manufacturer providing more than 6% of our total production during Fiscal 2022.
We source both finished products and raw materials. Raw materials include fabric, buttons, and other trim. Finished products consist of manufactured and
fully assembled products ready for shipment to our customers. In Fiscal 2022, approximately 97% of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside of
the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, with approximately 19% of our products sourced from China and another 19% from Vietnam. See
"Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations," Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions — Economic conditions
could have a negative impact on our major customers, suppliers,
16

================================================================================
vendors, and lenders, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business," and Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and
Operations — Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to
our specifications."
Most of our businesses must commit to the manufacturing of our garments before we sell finished goods, whether to wholly-owned retail stores or to
wholesale customers. We also must commit to the purchase of fabric from mills well in advance of our sales. If we overestimate our primary customers'
demand for a particular product or the need for a particular fabric or yarn, we primarily sell the excess products or garments made from such fabric or yarn in
our factory stores or through other secondary distribution channels.
Suppliers operate under the close supervision of our global manufacturing division. All products are produced according to our specifications and
standards. Production and quality control staff in Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe monitor manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to
correct problems prior to shipment of the final product. Procedures have been implemented under our vendor certification and compliance programs so that
quality assurance is reviewed early in the production process, allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with
minimal interruption.
Competition
Competition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with numerous designers
and manufacturers of apparel, footwear, accessories, fragrances, and home furnishing products, both domestic and international. We also face increasing
competition from companies selling our product categories through the Internet. Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have substantially
greater resources than us. We compete primarily on the basis of fashion, quality, value, and service, which depend on our ability to:
•
anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and shopping preferences, including the ever-increasing shift to digital brand
engagement, social media communications, and online and cross-channel shopping;
•
create and maintain favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and reputation for quality, including through digital brand engagement and online and
social media presence;
•
develop and produce innovative, high-quality products that appeal to consumers of varying age groups;
•
competitively price our products and create an acceptable value proposition for consumers;
•
provide strong and effective marketing support, including through digital and social media platforms in order to stay better connected to
consumers;
•
provide attractive, reliable, secure, and user-friendly digital commerce sites;
•
obtain sufficient retail floor space, and effectively present our products to consumers;
•
attract consumer traffic to stores, shop-within-shops, and digital commerce sites;
•
source sustainable raw materials at cost-effective prices;
•
anticipate and maintain proper inventory levels;
•
ensure product availability and optimize supply chain and distribution efficiencies;
•
maintain and grow market share;
•
recruit and retain employees to operate our retail stores, distribution centers, and various corporate functions;
•
protect our intellectual property; and
•
withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions.
See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations — We face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we
operate."

All facilities are designed to allow for high-density cube storage and value-added services, and utilize unit and carton tracking technology to facilitate
process control and inventory management. The distribution network is managed through globally integrated information technology systems.
Information Systems
Our information systems facilitate business processes, consumer experiences, and decision-making support across the Company and our extended
ecosystem of manufacturers, vendors, business partners, and customers. Our system applications are connected to support the flow of information across
functions, including:
•
product design, sourcing, and production;
•
comprehensive order processing, fulfillment, and distribution;
•
retail store and digital commerce operations;
•
marketing and advertising;
•
financial accounting and management reporting; and
•
human resources.
Our retail operation systems, including point-of-sale registers and merchandising, planning, and inventory management systems, support operational
processes within our store network and link with our digital commerce processes to support omni-channel capabilities.
We are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems and software. For example, during Fiscal 2022, we continued to transform our
value chain processes and technology to support advanced global capabilities for our supply and demand management solutions. In Fiscal 2022, we also
continued to accelerate our advanced analytics capabilities across functions. We are also continually enhancing the consumer experience by adding new
functionality to our direct-to-consumer channels, including new Connected Retail capabilities, which now include virtual selling appointments, Buy Online-
Pick Up in Store, and mobile checkout and contactless payments, among other capabilities.
We have a longstanding information security risk program structured according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity
Framework, industry best practices, privacy legislation, and other global and local standards and regulations. This program includes a defense-in-depth
approach with multiple layers of security controls, including network segmentation, security monitoring, endpoint protection, and identity and access
management, as well as data loss prevention controls. Our Audit Committee is updated on the overall performance of our information security risk program
on a quarterly basis.

================================================================================
Our cybersecurity awareness programs include phishing simulations, general cybersecurity awareness, and data protection modules, as well as more
contextual and personalized modules for targeted users and roles. We incorporate external expertise and guidance in all aspects of our program. We leverage
cybersecurity specialists to complete external audits and objective assessments of our cybersecurity program and practices, as well as to conduct targeted
attack simulations. We continually enhance our information security capabilities in order to protect against emerging threats, while also increasing our ability
to detect and respond to cyber incidents and maximize our resilience to recover from potential cyber-attacks. We have a robust incident response plan in place
that provides a documented runbook for handling high severity cybersecurity incidents and facilitates coordination across multiple parts of our Company. We
also routinely perform simulations and drills at both a technical and leadership level. Additionally, we have purchased network security and cyber liability
insurance in order to provide a level of financial protection, should a data breach occur.
See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Information Systems and Data Security — A data security or privacy breach could damage our
reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to litigation risk, and adversely affect our business" and "Risk Factors — Risks
Related to Information Systems and Data Security — Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate
effectively."
Wholesale Credit Control
We manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners,
and extend credit based on an evaluation of the wholesale customer's financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. We monitor credit
levels and the financial condition of our wholesale customers on a continuing basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor or underwrite our accounts
receivables, nor do we maintain credit insurance to manage the risk of bad debts. In North America, collection and deduction transactional activities are
provided through a third-party service provider. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations — A substantial portion of
our revenue is derived from a limited number of large wholesale customers. Our business could be adversely affected as a result of consolidations,
liquidations, restructurings, other ownership changes in the retail industry, and/or any financial instability of our large wholesale customers."
Trademarks
We own the RALPH LAUREN, POLO, POLO RALPH LAUREN, and the famous Polo Player Design trademarks in the U.S. and over 120 countries
worldwide. Other trademarks that we own include:
•
PURPLE LABEL;
•
DOUBLE RL;
•
RRL & DESIGN;
•
RLX;
•

•
LAUREN RALPH LAUREN;
•
PINK PONY;
•
LAUREN;
•
RALPH;
•
POLO BEAR;
•
CHAPS; and
•
Various other trademarks.
Mr. Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as trademarks RALPH LAUREN, DOUBLE RL, and RRL in perpetuity in connection with, among
other things, beef and living animals. The trademarks DOUBLE RL and RRL are currently used by the Double RL Company, an entity wholly owned by
Mr. R. Lauren. In addition, Mr. R. Lauren has the right to engage in personal projects involving film or theatrical productions (not including or relating to our
business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a company wholly owned by Mr. R. Lauren. Any activity by these companies has no impact on us.
19


================================================================================
[PAGE 22 OF 281]
================================================================================
Our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items of apparel, apparel-related
products and accessories, home furnishings, restaurant and café services, online services and online publications, and beauty products, as well as in
connection with retail services, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid
and enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. We regard
the license to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and, on a
worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. As a result of the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been the object of
counterfeiting. While we have a broad enforcement program which has been generally effective in protecting our intellectual property rights and limiting the
sale of counterfeit products in the U.S. and in most major markets abroad, we face greater challenges with respect to enforcing our rights against trademark
infringement in certain parts of Asia.
In markets outside of the U.S., our rights to some or all of our trademarks may not be clearly established. Over the course of our international
expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks, including POLO and/or a
representation of a Polo Player Design, which impede our use and registration of our principal trademarks. While such conflicts are common and may arise
again from time to time as we continue our international expansion, we have, in general, successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both legal
action and negotiated settlements with third-party owners of the conflicting marks (see Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and
Operations — Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the U.S." and Item 3 — "Legal Proceedings"
for further discussion). Although we have not suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot
assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce trademarks to new markets.
Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations
Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand is subject to duties. In addition, most of the
countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas and duties to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market
disruption. The U.S. and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported (from China or
other countries) at unfairly traded prices in such increased quantities that would cause (or threaten) injury to the relevant domestic industry (generally known
as "anti-dumping" actions). If dumping is suspected in the U.S., the U.S. government may self-initiate a dumping case on behalf of the U.S. textile industry
which could significantly affect our costs. Furthermore, additional duties, generally known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the
U.S. government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or
threatens to injure a U.S. industry.
In addition, each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. Because the U.S. and the other countries in
which our products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, or adjust
presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of import restrictions and opportunities. We seek to minimize
our potential exposure to import-related risks through, among other measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts of production among
countries and manufacturers, and through geographical diversification of our sources of supply.
As almost all of our products are manufactured by foreign suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international
trade regulations or executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in sourcing patterns could adversely affect our operations. See Item 1A — "Risk
Factors — Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, and Tax Matters — Our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory,
political, and economic risks" and "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations —  Our business is subject to risks associated with
importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications."
We are also subject to other international trade agreements, such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement,
the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement and other special trade preference
programs. A portion of our imported products are eligible for certain of these duty-advantaged programs.
Apparel and other products sold by us are under the jurisdiction of multiple governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade
Commission, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. Our products are
also subject to regulation in the U.S. and other countries, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which relate principally to product
labeling, licensing requirements, and consumer product safety requirements and regulatory testing, particularly with respect to products used by children. Any
failure
20


================================================================================
[PAGE 23 OF 281]
================================================================================
to comply with such requirements could result in significant penalties and require us to recall products, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business or operating results. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign
rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. Our licensed products, licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents,
and the vendors and factories with which we contract for the manufacture and distribution of our products are also subject to regulation. Our agreements
require our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, vendors, and factories to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we are
not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.
We are also subject to disclosure and reporting requirements, established under existing or new federal or state laws, such as the requirements to
identify the origin and existence of certain "conflict minerals" under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and disclosures of
specific actions to eradicate abusive labor practices in our supply chain under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. While we require our
suppliers to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and our operating guidelines which promote ethical and socially responsible business practices,
any violation of labor, environmental, health, and safety or other laws, or any divergence by an independent supplier's labor practices from generally accepted
industry standards, could damage our reputation, disrupt our sourcing capabilities, and increase the cost of doing business, adversely affecting our results of
operations. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations — Our business could suffer if we fail to comply with labor laws
or if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental practices."
Although we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant
impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets.
Human Capital
Our purpose is to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. This purpose extends to how we provide resources to
support our employees' health, well-being, work-life harmony, and quality of life. We believe that attracting, developing, and retaining a diverse work force
that is both skilled and motivated is critical to the successful execution of our long-term growth strategy. To this end, we are committed to creating a culture
and work environment in which all employees feel welcome and can thrive, both as individuals and as part of our team.
Our Board of Directors regularly reviews our people and development strategy, including our employee diversity, respect, and inclusion initiatives.
Our Employees
As of April  2, 2022, we had approximately 22,200 employees, comprised of approximately 13,500 full-time and 8,700 part-time employees.
Approximately 10,400 of our employees are located in the U.S.  and 11,800 are located in foreign countries. Approximately 5 of our U.S. production
employees in the womenswear business are members of Workers United (which was previously known as UNITE HERE) under an industry association
collective bargaining agreement, which our womenswear subsidiary has adopted. We consider our relations with both our union and non-union employees to
be good.
As of April  2, 2022, approximately 64% and 36% of our global workforce self-identified as female and male, respectively, and in the U.S.,
approximately 62% of our workforce self-identified as an underrepresented race and ethnic group and 33% self-identified as white, with the remaining 5%
electing not to disclose such information.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We believe the diversity of our employees and our culture of inclusivity drive innovation and creativity, and we are committed to further strengthening
such diversity and inclusion across race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and mental health and wellness, among other demographics, ensuring
fairness for all. Our diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DE&I") strategy is guided by the following five pillars:
1.
Talent — Cultivate diverse teams and elevate underrepresented talent to leadership ranks. In calendar 2019, we achieved our goal to have gender
parity in our leadership ranks for Vice President and above. We are committed to have at least 20% of People of Color in our global leadership
team by end of Fiscal 2023.
21


================================================================================
[PAGE 24 OF 281]
================================================================================
2.
Collaboration and Belonging — Enable open dialogue and create safe spaces for the amplification of diverse voices and perspectives. During
Fiscal 2022, we expanded our RL Community Groups to include a Veterans Network, focused on supporting veterans and active military
personnel, including our employees, spouses, family members, and allies, and a community group focused on religion, spirituality, and faith,
focusing on the co-existence of people of different faiths in the workplace. We also continued to deepen our work in our Racial Equity Manifesto
with specific and action-oriented commitments to elevate, amplify, and support the Black Community.
3.
Learning — Build an inclusive culture through awareness, education, and deployment of mandatory DE&I trainings globally. During Fiscal
2022, we expanded inclusive leadership learning with the rollout of Includership training for managers of people, which is also now included in
our new hire onboarding. In addition, we have mentoring and professional development programs offering internal and external development and
career acceleration programs for underrepresented talent. We also provided scholarship funds to academic programs supporting underrepresented
students.
4.
Communication and Messaging — Maximize our inclusive message and increase the transparency of our DE&I initiatives. We gather direct
feedback from our employees and measure their engagement to better understand how we can improve.
5.
Celebration and Recognition — Appreciate our unique differences and increase educational events for all employees with a focus on diverse
experiences. In Fiscal 2022, we increased educational and celebratory events focused on diverse experiences with over 70 virtual and in-person
DE&I events with 10,000 participants globally. Our DE&I efforts have been recognized in recent years, including being named a Best Place to
Work for LGTBQIA+, receiving 100% on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index for the third year in a row, as well as being
named Best Place to Advance for Women by Parity.Org.
During Fiscal 2022, our internal Global DE&I Synthesis Committee continued to meet bi-quarterly, whose members are directly accountable for
executing on our DE&I strategies ensuring consistent support to achieve our goals. This committee leads all 29 of our employee resource groups and their
impact work, which provides a robust structural framework to action on our DE&I commitments. We also continue to expand our advisory councils, including
the Black Advisory Council (U.S.A.), Race & Ethnicity Council in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Asian Pacific Islander Council, Native American
Council, and Hispanic, Latino, and Latinx Council, who advise our executive leadership team, marketing campaigns, and long-term programs and initiatives
to amplify the voices of underrepresented groups at Ralph Lauren.
In addition to our robust DE&I governance structure, our employees play a key role in embedding a culture of inclusion at Ralph Lauren through our
other employee resource groups, including our Gender Community Group, Pride Group, and Disability, Mental Health, and Wellness Group, and our new
community groups focused on veterans and co-existence of people of different faiths in the workplace. These groups promote dialogue, define DE&I focus
areas, and help us properly prioritize action plans and necessary resources to develop solutions.
Additional information relating to our DE&I initiatives and goals can be found in our annual sustainability reports, which is available at our website at
http://investor.ralphlauren.com under the caption "Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report." Our 2022 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report is
expected to be published in June 2022. The content of our sustainability reports is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in
any other report or document we file with the SEC.
Learning and Development
We are committed to the growth and development of our employees and offer a wide range of development programs for all levels. In addition to
receiving ongoing on-the-job training and coaching, our employees can build skills and prepare for the future through our Ralph Lauren Learning Portal.
During Fiscal 2022 we launched our RL Success Drivers, representing key attributes, skills, ways of thinking, and behaviors that ultimately create conditions
that better enable individuals and teams to succeed. Success requires all of our employees to be leaders and the RL Success Drivers act as the language of
such leadership by applying a common language that defines high performance and leadership excellence. We also launched our RL Learning Academy,
representing a collection of customized collaborative and experiential learning programs rooted in the RL Success Drivers that further supports our
employees' career progression, reinforces our company's culture, and promotes overall wellness and balance. We continue to build our learning portfolio and
have added new courses this year, many of which focus on hybrid working environments, including leading teams in such hybrid environments, as well as
DE&I education. We also support learning beyond our walls through tuition assistance. These collective learning and development programs help foster
career mobility for our employees, while simultaneously allowing us to fill open positions with existing employees who know our company best.

================================================================================
Employee Safety and Well-Being
We are committed to the safety, health, and overall well-being of each of our employees and their families, providing a wide array of physical,
emotional, social, and financial support to meet this objective. THRIVE, our global wellness program, provides access to volunteer events and physical and
mental wellness support. During Fiscal 2022, we launched the THRIVE application to give employees real-time access to wellness articles and resiliency
training and also to provide tools to set and track measurable wellness goals. We gather direct feedback from our workforce, including through regular
employee surveys, which allows us to measure their engagement and understand how we can improve.
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our priority has been to ensure the safety and well-being of all of our employees, customers, and the
communities in which we operate in around the world. In this regard, we have implemented new health and safety protocols in our stores, distribution centers,
and corporate offices. We have also expanded employee well-being services in the U.S. to include additional backup childcare, as well as MyStrength, an
online wellness portal. Globally, we host monthly wellness webinars and provide weekly meditation classes through our RL Well-Being Exchange program.
Financial grants have also been provided through the Ralph Lauren Employee Relief Fund for employees facing special circumstances.
Compensation and Benefits
We are committed to providing competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain a diverse and talented workforce. We are also committed to
achieving pay equity throughout our organization, conducting annual assessments in partnership with an independent firm who is a leader in workplace equity
and creators of a comprehensive analytics software platform used to analyze our employee compensation based on gender, race, and ethnicity. We offer a
wide array of both employer-paid and employee-paid benefits to support our employees' overall financial, physical, and mental well-being, including, but not
limited to, healthcare and welfare benefits, retirement savings, paid time off, temporary leave, sabbaticals, and flexible work arrangements. We also provide
our employees a merchandise discount on most of our products. During Fiscal 2022, we further expanded our medical benefits in the U.S. to a larger portion
of our part-time employees, ensuring equitable benefits for our front-line employees. We introduced a new healthcare benefit for our Puerto Rico retail
employees and in our U.S. distribution center which allows them to benefit from a reduction in total cost of care. Additionally, we launched a multi-year plan
to increase hourly wages for our store and distribution center employees.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors
There are risks associated with an investment in our securities. The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our
business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risk factors could materially adversely
affect our business, including our prospects, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the trading price of our securities, and/or the actual outcome
of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently
view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in future periods or if circumstances change.
Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions
Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our business could be adversely affected by infectious disease outbreaks, such as the novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19.
COVID-19, which emerged beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, has spread rapidly across the globe, including throughout all major geographies in
which we operate (North America, Europe, and Asia), resulting in adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well as significant volatility in
global financial markets. Governments worldwide have periodically imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel
bans, stay-at-home orders, and forced business closures or other operational restrictions, including reduced capacity limits and operating hours, all in an effort
to reduce the spread of the virus. Such factors, among others, have resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on
discretionary items.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of our stores, distribution
centers, and corporate facilities, as have our wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors, as described in Item 1 — "Business — Recent
Developments." Collectively, these disruptions have had a material adverse impact on our business throughout the pandemic, particularly during Fiscal 2021.
Despite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve, including the emergence of variants of the
virus, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, which has and could continue to adversely affect consumer sentiment and confidence. Accordingly, we cannot
predict for how long and to what extent this crisis will continue to impact our business operations or the overall global economy. Potential impacts to our
business include, but are not limited to:
•
our ability to successfully execute our long-term growth strategy;
•
reduced retail traffic at our stores and those of our wholesale customers and licensing partners due to forced closures or other operational restrictions,
such as reduced capacity limits and operating hours, declines in tourism, and/or potential changes in consumer behavior and shopping preferences,
such as their willingness to congregate in shopping centers or other populated locations and the overall growing preference to shop online versus at
traditional brick and mortar locations;
•
potential declines in the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, caused by higher
unemployment and lower disposal income levels, inflationary pressures, travel and social gathering restrictions, work-from-home arrangements, or
other factors beyond our control;
•
the potential build-up of excess inventory as a result of store closures and/or lower consumer demand;
•
temporary closures or other operational restrictions of our distribution centers and/or corporate facilities;
•
supply chain disruptions resulting from closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, shipping and loading capacity constraints,
and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas, including any related cost increases;
•
our ability to attract, retain, and manage employees in the current environment, which include remote working arrangements;
•
additional costs to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities, such as more frequent and thorough cleanings of our
facilities and supplying personal protection equipment;
•
the potential loss of one or more of our significant wholesale customers or licensing partners, or the loss of a large number of smaller wholesale
customers or licensing partners, if they are not able to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions, and our ability to collect
outstanding receivables;
•
increased vulnerability to data security or privacy breaches as a result of a substantial portion of our corporate employees continuing to work
remotely;
•
our ability to successfully negotiate with landlords to obtain rent abatements, rent deferrals, and other relief;

================================================================================
•
our ability to access capital markets and maintain compliance with covenants associated with our existing debt instruments, as well as the ability of
our key customers, suppliers, and vendors to do the same with regard to their own obligations;
•
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support our operations, including repayment of our debt obligations as they become due, as well as to
return value to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock;
•
diversion of management attention and resources from ongoing business activities and/or a decrease in employee morale; and
•
our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Additional discussion related to the various risks and uncertainties described above is included elsewhere within this "Risk Factors" section of this Form 10-
K.
Economic, political, and other conditions may adversely affect the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products,
including our products.
The industries in which we operate are cyclical. Many economic and other factors outside of our control affect the level of consumer spending in the
apparel, footwear, accessory, and home product industries, including, among others, man-made or natural disasters, such as pandemic diseases; consumer
perceptions of personal well-being and safety; consumer perceptions of current and future economic conditions; employment levels and wage rates; stock
market performance; inflation; interest rates; foreign currency exchange rates; the housing market; consumer debt levels; the availability of consumer credit;
commodity prices, including fuel and energy costs; global food supplies; taxation; general domestic and international political conditions; the threat, outbreak,
or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts, or other hostilities; and weather conditions.
Consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, tend to decline during periods of recession or high
inflation and at other times when disposable income is lower. Unfavorable economic conditions and other factors, such as pandemic diseases and other health-
related concerns, political unrest, military conflicts, and acts of terrorism, may also reduce consumers' willingness and ability to travel to major cities and
vacation destinations in which our stores and shop-within-shops are located. Further, consumers may prefer to spend more of their discretionary income on
"experiences," such as dining and entertainment, over consumer goods. Stay-at-home orders, social gathering restrictions, and work-from-home
arrangements, such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, may also diminish consumers' demand for luxury apparel products. Accordingly, a
downturn or an uncertain outlook in the economies in which we, or our wholesale customers and licensing partners, sell our products, or other changes in
consumer preferences, may materially adversely affect our business.
Economic conditions could have a negative impact on our major customers, suppliers, vendors, and lenders, which in turn could materially
adversely affect our business.
Although we believe that our existing cash and investments, cash provided by operations, and available borrowing capacity under our credit and
overdraft facilities and commercial paper borrowing program will provide us with sufficient liquidity, the impact of economic conditions on our major
customers, suppliers, vendors, and lenders, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and their ability to access global capital markets cannot
be predicted. The inability of major manufacturers to ship our products could impair our ability to meet the delivery date requirements of our customers.
Deterioration in global financial or capital markets could affect our ability to access sources of liquidity to provide for our future cash needs, increase the cost
of any future financing, or cause our lenders to be unable to meet their funding commitments under our credit and overdraft facilities. A disruption in the
ability of our significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a
significant reduction in their future orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could
have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations.
Our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. Specifically, changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies
impact our financial results from a transactional perspective, as our foreign operations generally purchase inventory in U.S. dollars, as is common for most
apparel companies. Given that we source most of our products overseas, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant
currencies. Changes in currency exchange rates may also impact consumers' willingness or ability to travel abroad and/or purchase our products while
traveling,
26


================================================================================
[PAGE 29 OF 281]
================================================================================
as well as affect the U.S. Dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international businesses sell products. Additionally, the
operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as their financial results are
translated from the respective local currency into U.S. Dollars during the financial statement consolidation process. The foreign currencies to which we are
exposed to from a transactional and translational perspective primarily include the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the
Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi. The expansion of our international business increases our exposure
to foreign currency exchange risk.
Although we hedge certain exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot fully
anticipate all of our currency exposures and therefore foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, factors
that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging activities include the volatility of currency markets, the accuracy of forecasted transactions, and the
availability of hedging instruments. As such, our hedging activities may not completely mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of
operations. See Item 7 — "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Market Risk Management."
Risks Related to our Strategic Initiatives and Restructuring Activities
We cannot assure the successful implementation of our growth strategy.
We have developed a long-term growth strategy with the objective of delivering sustainable, profitable growth and long-term value creation for
shareholders, as described in Item 1 — "Business — Objectives and Opportunities." Our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy is subject to
various risks and uncertainties, as described herein.
Although we believe that our growth strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, there can be no assurance regarding the timing
of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits, if at all. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits, which may be due to our inability to
execute the various elements of our growth strategy, changes in consumer preferences, competition, economic conditions (including inflationary pressures),
and other risks described herein, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain challenges, could have a material adverse effect on our
business. Such a failure could also result in the implementation of additional restructuring-related activities beyond those currently planned, which may be
dilutive to our earnings in the short term.
Achievement of our growth strategy may require investment in new capabilities, distribution channels, and technologies. These investments may result
in short-term costs without accompanying current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term. There can be no assurance
regarding the timing of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits of these investments and other costs, if at all.
We may not be successful in the expansion of our multi-channel distribution network or accelerating growth in certain product categories.
Implementation of our growth strategy involves the continuation and expansion of our multi-channel distribution network, including within
international markets such as China, which is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to (i) identify new or underpenetrated markets
where our products and brand will be accepted by consumers; (ii) attract customers, particularly in new markets; (iii) identify desirable freestanding and
department store locations, the availability of which may be out of our control; (iv) negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement
allowances; (v) efficiently and cost effectively build-out stores and shop-within-shops; (vi) source sufficient inventory levels timely to meet the needs of the
new stores and shop-within-shops; (vii) hire, train, and retain competent store personnel; and (viii) integrate new stores and shop-within-shops into our
existing systems and operations.
Any of these challenges could delay or otherwise prevent us from successfully executing our distribution expansion strategy. There can be no assurance
that our new stores and shop-within-shops will be successful and profitable or if the capital costs associated with the build-out of such new locations will be
recovered. Further, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new or existing competitors that have a more established market presence than
us or other competitive advantages. Other risks related to our international expansion plans include (i) changes in general economic conditions in specific
countries and markets, including those resulting from pandemic diseases, civil or political instability, or military conflicts; (ii) changes in diplomatic and trade
relationships and any resulting anti-American sentiment; (iii) foreign government regulation; and (iv) restrictions on the repatriation of funds held
internationally, among other risks described herein. If our expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our
business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

================================================================================
The success of our business also depends largely on our ability to continue to maintain, enhance, and expand our digital footprint and capabilities. In
recent years, consumers have been increasingly shopping online using computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices, and using such devices to perform
comparison shopping on a real-time basis. The COVID-19 pandemic has further amplified this trend due in part to travel bans, stay-at-home orders, forced
business closures, and other operational restrictions, which impede upon the ease at which consumers can shop at brick and mortar locations. Many
consumers may also prefer to avoid populated locations, such as indoor shopping centers, in fear of exposing themselves to the virus or other infectious
diseases. Any failure on our part, or on the part of our third-party digital partners, to provide attractive, reliable, secure, and user-friendly digital commerce
platforms, including mobile apps, could negatively impact our customers' shopping experience resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our
brands, and lost sales. In addition, as we continue to expand and increase the global presence of our digital commerce business, sales from our brick and
mortar stores and wholesale channels of distribution in areas where digital commerce sites are introduced may decline due to changes in consumer shopping
habits and cannibalization.
Our growth strategy also includes accelerating growth in certain high-value, underdeveloped product categories, comprised of denim, wear to work,
outerwear, footwear, and accessories. We compete with other retailers in these product categories, some of which may be significantly larger than us and more
established in these product categories, and competition is intense, as described within other risk factors herein. There can be no assurance that our targeted
expansion in these product categories will be successful.
The success of our business depends on our ability to respond to constantly changing fashion and retail trends and consumer preferences in a timely
manner, develop products that resonate with our existing customers and attract new customers, and provide a seamless shopping experience to our
customers.
The industries in which we operate have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. Our success depends in
large part on our ability to originate and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge, and react to changing consumer
preferences in a timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers worldwide whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and
are subject to rapid change, influenced by fashion trends, economic conditions, and weather conditions, among other factors. This issue is further
compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared across the globe. We
cannot assure that we will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or successfully meet constantly changing consumer preferences in the future. In
addition, we cannot assure that any new products or brands that we introduce will be successfully received by consumers. Any failure on our part to
anticipate, identify, and respond effectively to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our products
and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if
manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. Any of these outcomes could have a material
adverse effect on our business. For a discussion of risks related to our inventory management, see "Risks Related to our Strategic Initiatives and
Restructuring Activities — Our profitability may decline if we are unable to effectively manage inventory or as a result of increasing pressure on margins."
Our marketing and advertising programs are integral to the success of our product offerings and on our ability to attract new customers and retain
existing customers. Our communication campaigns are increasingly being executed through digital and social media platforms to drive further engagement
with the younger consumer, with a focus on influencers. However, we cannot assure that our marketing and advertising programs will be successful or appeal
to consumers.
The success of our business also depends on our ability to continue to develop and maintain a reliable omni-channel experience for our customers, as
well as our ability to introduce new Connected Retail capabilities, such as virtual selling appointments, Buy Online-Pick Up in Store, and mobile checkout
and contactless payments, among other capabilities. Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to a shopping experience through multiple
technologies, including computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices, as our customers have become increasingly technologically savvy and expect a
seamless omni-channel experience regardless of whether they are shopping in stores or online. We are increasingly using digital and social media platforms to
interact with customers and enhance their shopping experience. If we are unable to develop and continuously improve our customer-facing technologies, the
efforts of which typically require significant capital investments, we may not be able to provide a convenient and consistent experience to our customers
regardless of the sales channel. This could negatively affect our ability to compete with other retailers and result in diminished loyalty to our brands, which
could adversely impact our business.
We have also implemented, and expect to continue to implement, new store design concepts and other renovations to our existing store portfolio as part
of our growth strategy. There can be no assurance that any of our store designs will resonate with customers or otherwise achieve the desired sales and
profitability measures necessary to recover our initial capital investments, and such risks may be further compounded during periods of adverse economic
conditions. If customers are not receptive to the
28


================================================================================
[PAGE 31 OF 281]
================================================================================
design layout or visual merchandising of our stores, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, the failure of our store designs to achieve
acceptable results could lead to asset impairment charges and/or our decision to close a store prior to the lease expiration date resulting in other store closure-
related charges, including early lease termination fees. For additional discussion of risks related to the early termination of our leases, see "Risks Related to
our Business and Operations — Our business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases."
Our profitability may decline if we are unable to effectively manage inventory or as a result of increasing pressure on margins.
We have implemented key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and improve the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply
chain. Although we have shortened lead times for the design, sourcing, and production of certain of our product lines, we expect to continue to place orders
with our vendors for the majority of products in advance of the related selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences and
demand and pricing shifts. Our failure to continue to shorten lead times or to correctly anticipate consumer preferences and demand could result in the build-
up of excess inventory. Other factors beyond our control could also result in the build-up of excess inventory, including unforeseen adverse economic
conditions or business disruptions, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Excess inventory levels could result in the utilization of less-preferred
distribution channels, markdowns, promotional sales, donations, or destruction to dispose of such excess or slow-moving inventory, which may negatively
impact our overall profitability and/or impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if manufacturers
fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which may negatively impact customer relationships, diminish
brand loyalty, and result in lost sales. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Additionally, our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition and a highly promotional
retail environment, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes in consumer spending patterns.
Although we continue to limit our promotional activity in connection with our quality of sales initiatives, these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices
to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset
price reductions with comparable reductions in our costs. If our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses,
our profitability will decline. In addition, changes in our customer, channel, and geographic sales mix could have a negative impact on our profitability. Any
of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring plans.
We have implemented restructuring plans to support key strategic initiatives, such as the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan, as described in Item 1
— "Business — Recent Developments." Although designed to deliver long-term sustainable growth, restructuring plans present significant potential risks that
may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, including (i) higher than
anticipated costs in implementing planned workforce reductions, particularly in highly regulated locations outside the U.S.; (ii) higher than anticipated lease
termination and store or facility closure costs (see "Risks Related to our Business and Operations — Our business is subject to risks associated with leasing
real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases"); (iii) failure to meet operational targets or customer requirements due to the loss of
employees or inadequate transfer of knowledge; (iv) failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing, and subsequent to completing, our
restructuring plans; (v) diversion of management attention and resources from ongoing business activities and/or a decrease in employee morale; (vii) attrition
beyond any planned reduction in workforce; and (viii) damage to our reputation and brand image due to our restructuring-related activities.
If we are not successful in implementing and managing our restructuring plans, we may not be able to achieve targeted operating enhancements, sales
growth, and/or cost reductions, which could adversely impact our business. Our failure to achieve targeted results for any reason, including business
disruptions from pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, could also lead to the implementation of additional restructuring-related activities, which may be
dilutive to our earnings in the short term.

================================================================================
Risks Related to our Business and Operations
The loss of the services of Mr. Ralph Lauren or any other changes to our executive and senior management team may be disruptive to, or cause
uncertainty in, our business.
Mr. Ralph Lauren's leadership in the design and marketing areas of our business has been a critical element of our success since the inception of our
Company. Mr. R. Lauren is instrumental to, and closely identified with, our brand that bears his name. Our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage
the goodwill associated with Mr. R. Lauren's name may be damaged if we were to lose his services. The death or disability of Mr. R. Lauren or other extended
or permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or industry perception with respect to him or arising from his loss, could have a material adverse
effect on our business.
We also depend on the service and management experience of other key executive officers and members of senior management who have substantial
experience and expertise in our industry and our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. Competition in our industry to
attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our reputation, our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, and economic
conditions, among other factors. Any changes in our executive and senior management team, including those resulting from our restructuring actions, may be
disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business and future strategic direction. The departure of any key individuals and the failure to ensure a smooth
transition and effective transfer of knowledge involving senior employees could hinder or delay our strategic planning and execution, as well as adversely
affect our ability to attract and retain other experienced and talented employees. Furthermore, the retail industry (among others) has been adversely affected
by overall labor shortages resulting from a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic, labor disputes, strikes, and other factors. The introduction of new work
arrangements and company-specific requirements regarding when and how often employees are required to work on-site versus remotely may also impact
companies' ability to attract and retain employees. The departure of key individuals or our failure to maintain sufficient employee staffing levels could have a
material adverse impact on our business, as well as impede our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls and compliance with the
requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
We are not protected by a material amount of key-man or similar life insurance covering our executive officers, including Mr. R. Lauren, or other
members of senior management. We have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, but competition for experienced
executives in our industry is intense and the non-compete period with respect to certain of our executive officers could, in some circumstances in the event of
their termination of employment with our Company, end prior to the employment term set forth in their employment agreements.
We face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate.
We face increasing competition from companies selling apparel, footwear, accessories, home, and other of our product categories through the Internet.
Although we sell our products through the Internet, increased competition and promotional activity in the worldwide apparel, footwear, accessory, and home
product industries from Internet-based competitors could reduce our sales, prices, and margins. We also face intense competition from other domestic and
foreign fashion-oriented apparel, footwear, accessory, and casual apparel producers that sell products through brick and mortar stores and wholesale and
licensing channels. We compete with these companies primarily on the basis of:
•
anticipating and responding in a timely fashion to changing consumer demands and shopping preferences, including the ever-increasing shift to
digital brand engagement, social media communications, and online and cross-channel shopping;
•
creating and maintaining favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and a reputation for quality, including through digital brand engagement and
online and social media presence;
•
developing and producing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups;
•
competitively pricing our products and creating an acceptable value proposition for consumers, including price increases to mitigate inflationary
pressures while simultaneously balancing the risk of lower consumer demand in response to any such price increases;
•
providing strong and effective marketing support in several diverse demographic markets, including through digital and social media platforms
in order to stay better connected to consumers;
•
providing attractive, reliable, secure, and user-friendly digital commerce sites;
•
obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at stores and shop-within-shops;
•
attracting consumer traffic to stores, shop-within-shops, and digital commerce sites;
30


================================================================================
[PAGE 33 OF 281]
================================================================================
•
sourcing sustainable raw materials at cost-effective prices;
•
anticipating and maintaining proper inventory levels;
•
ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain and distribution efficiencies with third-party manufacturers and retailers;
•
maintaining and growing market share;
•
recruiting and retaining employees to operate our retail stores, distribution centers, and various corporate functions;
•
protecting our intellectual property; and
•
ability to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions.
Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified and may have greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources, more
desirable store locations, and/or greater digital commerce presence than us, among other competitive advantages. Such competitive advantages may enable
them to better withstand unfavorable economic conditions, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production, and/or more quickly respond to
rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences than us. In addition, technological advances and the retail industry's low barriers to entry allow for
the introduction of new competitors and products at a rapid pace, which has been further compounded by the increasing shift to digital shopping channels.
Any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced market share or sales, which could
adversely affect our business.
The success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value and reputation of our brands.
Our success depends on the value and reputation of our brands and our ability to consistently anticipate, identify, and respond to customers' demands,
preferences, and fashion trends in the design, pricing, and production of our products, including the preference for certain products to be manufactured in the
U.S., and deliver high-quality and sustainable products. Any negative publicity regarding Mr. R. Lauren, or other members of our executive and senior
management team, or our Company as a whole, especially through social media which accelerates and increases the potential scope of negative publicity,
could negatively impact the image of our brands with our customers and result in diminished loyalty to our brands and potentially lead to adverse consumer
actions, including boycotts, even if the subject of such publicity is unverified or inaccurate and we seek to correct it. Consumer sentiment can also be
influenced by our partnership with athletes and other public figures. Even if we react appropriately to negative publicity, our customers' perception of our
brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. Any failure on our part to retain the value and reputation of brands could adversely impact our
business.
Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the U.S.
We believe that our trademarks, intellectual property, and other proprietary rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position.
We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities worldwide. However, significant
counterfeiting and imitation of our products continue to exist. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect trademarks or other
proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. and, as a result, our intellectual property may be more vulnerable and difficult to protect in
such countries. Over the course of our international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or claimed
ownership rights to some of our key trademarks that include Polo and/or a representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise have contested our
rights to our trademarks. We have resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements. We cannot guarantee that the
actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting, lost business, or brand
dilution, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to challenge brands arising
from imitation of our products. Also, there can be no assurance that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of
ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction or at all. See Item 1 — "Business — Trademarks," and Item 3 —
"Legal Proceedings."
Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our
specifications.
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products. Our
products are manufactured to our specifications through arrangements with over 300 foreign manufacturers in various countries. In Fiscal 2022,
approximately 97% of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, with approximately
19% of our products sourced from China and another 19% from Vietnam. Risks inherent in importing our products include:
31


================================================================================
[PAGE 34 OF 281]
================================================================================
•
pandemic diseases, such as COVID-19, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, port congestion,
and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;
•
changes in social, political, and economic conditions, including those resulting from military conflicts, terrorist acts, or other hostilities, that
could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are located;
•
changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including the imposition of any sanctions, restrictions, and other responses, such as those recently
issued by the U.S. and other countries against Russia in response to its war with Ukraine;
•
the imposition of additional regulations, quotas, or safeguards relating to imports or exports, and costs of complying with such regulations and
other laws relating to the identification and reporting of the sources of raw materials used in our products;
•
the imposition of additional duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges on imports or exports;
•
unfavorable changes in the availability, cost, or quality of raw materials and commodities;
•
increases in the cost of labor, travel, and transportation;
•
disruptions of shipping and international trade caused by natural and man-made disasters, labor shortages (stemming from labor disputes,
strikes, or otherwise), or other unforeseen events, including any resulting impact to shipping prices;
•
heightened terrorism-related cargo and supply chain security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more
frequent, or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in the delivery of cargo;
•
decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures, and
damage to the reputation of our brands; and
•
the imposition of sanctions in the form of additional duties either by the U.S. or its trading partners to remedy perceived illegal actions by
national governments.
The entire apparel industry, including our Company, continues to face supply chain challenges as a result of COVID-19-related business disruptions,
political instability, inflationary pressures, and other factors, including reduced freight availability, port congestion, labor shortages, and rising wages and
energy costs, among other factors. The inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our strict quality standards
could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept
deliveries, or a substantial reduction in purchase prices. We have also incurred, and expect to continue to incur, higher freight and other logistic costs as a
result of certain of the beforementioned factors, as well as our increased use of air freight as we attempt to mitigate delays in inventory receipts. Prices of raw
materials used to manufacture our products are also subject to significant fluctuation as a result of certain of the beforementioned factors, as well as crop
yields which could be negatively impacted by severe weather conditions. We may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, freight, or other
sourcing costs through pricing actions or other means. Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business. For a discussion of risks
related to the potential imposition of additional regulations and laws, see "Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, and Tax Matters — Our ability to conduct
business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks."
Our business could suffer if we need to replace manufacturers or distribution centers.
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products. We
compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers. Some of these competitors may place larger orders than we do, and thus may
have an advantage in securing production capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer of ours must be replaced,
we may have to expand our third-party manufacturing capacity. We cannot guarantee that this additional capacity will be available when required on terms
that are acceptable to us. See Item 1 — "Business — Sourcing, Production and Quality." We enter into purchase order commitments each season specifying a
time for delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications, and other standard industry provisions, but do not have long-term contracts with any
manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively.
In addition, we rely on a number of owned, leased, and independently-operated distribution facilities around the world to warehouse and ship products
to our customers and perform other related logistic services. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on the proper operation of these
distribution centers. Our distributions centers generally utilize computer-

controlled and automated equipment, which are subject to various risks, including software viruses, security breaches, power interruptions, or other system
failures. If any of our distribution centers were to close or become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, including pandemic diseases such as COVID-19,
or if we fail to successfully consolidate existing facilities or transition to new facilities, we could experience a substantial loss of inventory, disruption of
deliveries to our customers and our stores, increased costs, and longer lead times associated with the distribution of products during the period that would be
required to reopen or replace the facility. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We also rely upon third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution
centers, to our stores and shop-within-shops, and to our digital commerce and wholesale customers. Our utilization of these shipping services is subject to
various risks, including, but not limited to, potential labor shortages (stemming from labor disputes, strikes, or otherwise), severe weather, and pandemic
diseases, which could delay the timing of shipments, and increases in wages and fuel prices, which could result in higher transportation costs. The rapid
increase of online shopping driven by changes in consumer shopping preferences has amplified certain of these risks resulting in capacity constraints. As
previously noted, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, higher freight and other logistic costs as a result of certain of the beforementioned
factors, as well as our increased use of air freight as we attempt to mitigate delays in inventory receipts. Any delays in the timing of our product shipments or
increases in transportation costs could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases.
We generally operate most of our stores and corporate facilities under long-term, non-cancellable leasing arrangements. Our retail store leases
typically require us to make minimum rental payments, and often contingent rental payments based upon sales. In addition, our leases generally require us to
pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance, and utilities. We generally cannot cancel our leases at our option. If we decide to
close a store, or if we decide to downsize, consolidate, or relocate any of our corporate facilities, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or
exit costs associated with the disposal of the store or corporate facility. In addition, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other
things, payment of the base rent for the remaining lease term, even after the space is exited or otherwise closed and even if such closures are beyond our
control (such as the forced store closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic). Such costs and obligations related to the early or temporary closure of our
stores or termination of our leases could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, as each of our leases naturally expires, we may be unable
to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could lead to store closures resulting in lost sales.
A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of large wholesale customers. Our business could be adversely affected as a
result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings, other ownership changes in the retail industry, and/or any financial instability of our large
wholesale customers.
Several of our department store customers, including some under common ownership, account for a significant portion of our wholesale net sales. A
substantial portion of sales of our licensed products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest department store customers. Sales to our
three largest wholesale customers accounted for approximately 16% of total net revenues for Fiscal 2022, and these customers accounted for approximately
31% of our total gross trade accounts receivable outstanding as of April 2, 2022. Substantially all sales to our three largest wholesale customers related to our
North America segment.
We typically do not enter into long-term agreements with our customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our
customers for each of our product lines every season. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether
motivated by economic conditions, financial difficulties, competitive conditions, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased
from us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners or their new strategic and operational
initiatives, including their continued focus on further development of their "private label" initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
The department store sector has also experienced numerous consolidations, restructurings, reorganizations, and other ownership changes in recent
years, which could potentially increase in frequency as a result of prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions, such as those being caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic, or changes in consumer shopping preferences, such as the increasing shift away from traditional brick and mortar wholesale retailers to
larger online retailers. Our wholesale customers have experienced significant business disruptions as a result of the pandemic, including declines in retail
traffic, temporary store closures, and other operational restrictions. There can be no assurance that our wholesale customers have adequate financial resources
and/or access to additional capital to withstand prolonged periods of such adverse economic
33


================================================================================
[PAGE 36 OF 281]
================================================================================
conditions. The loss of one or more significant wholesale customers, or the loss of a large number of smaller wholesale customers, could have a material
adverse effect on our business.
Further, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our large wholesale customers, particularly those located in the U.S., have been highly
promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise, including our products. The continuation of such promotional activity could negatively
impact our brand image and/or lead to requests from those customers for increased markdown allowances at the end of the season. In response and in
connection with our growth plan, we strategically reduce shipments to certain of our customers and close less productive doors when deemed appropriate.
We sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners across North America,
Europe, Asia, and Australia, and extend credit based on an evaluation of each wholesale customer's financial condition, usually without requiring collateral.
However, the financial difficulties of a wholesale customer, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause us to limit or eliminate our
business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to that customer's receivables. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts
receivable from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. See Item 1 — "Business — Wholesale Credit Control."
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could restrict our ability to engage in additional capital-related transactions in the future.
As of April 2, 2022, our consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.636 billion, comprised of our outstanding borrowings under Senior Notes.
We also maintain several credit and overdraft facilities, including our Global Credit Facility, which collectively had a remaining availability of approximately
$564 million as of April 2, 2022. Accordingly, the amount of our indebtedness could further increase materially if we decide to draw upon our credit or
overdraft facilities. This substantial level of indebtedness could have adverse consequences to our business, including (i) making it more difficult to satisfy
our debt obligations as they become due; (ii) impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; (iii) limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react
to, changes in our business; and (iv) increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.
We rely on our operating cash flows to repay our outstanding borrowings, as well as to fund any working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend
payments, share repurchases, and other general corporate purposes. Prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions in any of our
key regions, or a combination thereof, such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could impede our ability to pay our obligations as they become
due or return value to our shareholders, as well as delay previously planned expenditures related to our operations. Credit rating agencies also periodically
review our capital structure and our ability to generate earnings. A prolonged period of deteriorated financial performance or our inability to comply with debt
covenants (as discussed below) could make future financing more difficult to secure and/or expensive. Further, factors beyond our control, such as adverse
economic conditions, could disrupt capital markets and limit the availability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital to us in the future.
Certain of our debt instruments contain a number of affirmative and negative covenants, including maintaining a leverage ratio at or below a specified
level. Our failure to comply with such covenants or otherwise secure temporary waivers of non-compliance, could result in the termination of the related
facilities and/or our lenders demanding any amounts outstanding to be immediately repaid, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Further, even if we are able to obtain waivers of non-compliance, such waivers may result in incremental fees, higher interest rates, and/or additional
restrictions and covenants.
We rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses. Failure to maintain licensing partners could harm our business.
The risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks specific to a licensing
partner's business, including risks associated with a particular licensing partner's ability to (i) obtain capital; (ii) execute its business plans; (iii) manage its
labor relations; (iv) maintain relationships with its suppliers and customers; (v) generate sufficient cash flows to fund its operations and pay its obligations as
they become due, including minimum royalties due to us; (vi) withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions, such as those being caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war; and (vii) manage its credit and bankruptcy risks effectively.
Although a number of our license agreements prohibit our licensing partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our competitors, our
licensing partners generally are not precluded from offering, under other non-competitor brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements
with us. A substantial portion of sales of our products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest customers. While we have significant
control over our licensing partners'
34


================================================================================
[PAGE 37 OF 281]
================================================================================
products and advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other things, operational and financial control over their businesses. Changes in
management, reduced sales of licensed products, poor execution, or financial difficulties with respect to any of our licensing partners could adversely affect
our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Although we believe that we
could replace our existing licensing partners in most circumstances, if necessary, our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our
revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. See Item 1 — "Business — Our
Licensing Business."
Our business could be adversely affected by man-made or natural disasters and other catastrophic events in the locations in which we or our
customers or suppliers operate.
Our operations, including retail, distribution, and warehousing operations, are susceptible to man-made or natural disasters, including pandemic
diseases such as COVID-19, severe weather, geological events, and other catastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks and military conflict, any of which
could disrupt our operations. In addition, the operations of our customers and suppliers could experience similar disruptions. The occurrence of natural
disasters or other catastrophic events may result in sudden disruptions in the business operations of the local economies affected, as well as of the regional
and global economies. The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect financial markets and the availability of capital. In addition, our business can
be affected by unseasonable weather conditions, such as extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures in the winter or unseasonably cold
temperatures in the summer. There is growing concern that climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and
natural disasters. Any of these events could result in decreased demand for our products and disruptions in our sales channels and manufacturing and
distribution networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Risks Related to Information Systems and Data Security
A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to litigation risk,
and adversely affect our business.
We are dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet, for a significant portion of our direct-to-consumer sales,
including our digital commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing. We are also responsible for storing data
relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our digital commerce sites and for the various social media tools and
websites we use as part of our marketing strategy. In our normal course of business, we often collect, transmit, and/or retain certain sensitive and confidential
customer information, including credit card information. There is significant concern by consumers, employees, and lawmakers alike over the security of
personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft, and user privacy, as cyber-criminals are becoming increasingly more sophisticated
in their attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and confidential or sensitive data.
Despite the security measures we currently have in place (including those described in Item 1 — "Business — Information Systems"), our facilities and
systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to targeted or random attacks that could lead to security breaches, acts of vandalism,
phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, malware, ransomware, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other
Internet or email events. The increased use of smartphones, tablets, and other wireless devices, as well as ongoing work-from-home arrangements for a
substantial portion of our corporate employees, may also heighten these and other operational risks. The retail industry in particular continues to be the target
of many cyber-attacks, which are becoming increasingly more difficult to anticipate and prevent due to their rapidly evolving nature. Furthermore, economic
sanctions issued by one country against another, such as those recently issued by the U.S. and other countries against Russia in response to its war with
Ukraine, could increase the risk of retaliatory state-sponsored cyber-attacks. Given the rapidly evolving nature, sophistication, and complexity of cyber-
attacks, despite our reasonable efforts to mitigate and prevent such attacks, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, prevent, detect, or implement
effective preventive measures to protect against all cyber-attack incidents.
Although we have purchased network security and cyber liability insurance to provide a level of financial protection should a data breach occur, such
insurance may not cover us against all claims or costs associated with such a breach, and we cannot be certain that such insurance will continue to be
available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all, or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Additionally, the technology we
use to protect our systems from being breached or compromised could become outdated as a result of advances in computer capabilities or other technological
developments, thereby requiring us to make further investments in capital or other resources to protect us against cyber-attacks, the cost of which could be
significant. Further, measures we implement to protect our computer systems against cyber-attacks may make them harder to use or reduce the speed at which
they operate, which in turn could negatively impact our customers' shopping experience resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands,
and lost sales.

================================================================================
Any perceived or actual electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or
personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security, whether by us or by a third party, could disrupt our business, severely
damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees, or vendors, expose us to risks of litigation, significant fines and penalties,
liability, and higher costs for insurance or insurance not being available to us on economically feasible terms or at all, and result in deterioration in our
customers', employees', or vendors' confidence in us, and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Since we do not control
third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future, any
perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our employees, customers, or website visitors could harm our
reputation and credibility, result in lost sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors, and/or reduce our ability to attract and retain employees and
customers. As these threats develop and grow, we may find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and our infrastructure,
including the implementation of new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems, deployment of additional personnel and protection-related
technologies, engagement of third-party consultants, and training of employees.
In addition, the regulatory environment relating to information security and privacy is becoming increasingly more demanding with frequent new
requirements surrounding the handling, protection, and use of personal and sensitive information. We may incur significant costs in complying with the
various applicable state, federal, and foreign laws regarding protection of, and unauthorized disclosure of, personal information. Additionally, failing to
comply with such laws and regulations could damage the reputation of our brands and lead to adverse consumer actions, as well as expose us to government
enforcement action and/or private litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business.
Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.
We are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including designing, marketing,
manufacturing, importing, tracking, and distributing our products, processing payments, accounting for and reporting financial results, and managing our
employees and employee benefit programs. In addition, we have digital commerce and other informational websites in North America, Europe, and Asia,
including Australia and New Zealand, and have plans for additional digital commerce sites in the future. Our digital commerce operations are a critical
element of our long-term growth strategy and are vital to the overall success of our business. Furthermore, a substantial portion of our corporate employees
continue to work remotely. Given the complexity of our business and the significant number of transactions that we engage in on a daily basis, it is imperative
that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our computer hardware and software systems.
Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses,
technical malfunctions, inadequate system capacity, power outages, natural disasters, and usage errors by our employees or third-party consultants. If our
information technology systems become damaged or otherwise cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to repair or replace
them. Additionally, confidential or sensitive data related to our customers, employees, or vendors could be lost or compromised. We are continually
improving and upgrading our computer systems and software, which also involves risks and uncertainties. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the
design, implementation, or transition of such systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in the sourcing, sale, and shipment of our product, delays in
the collection of cash from our customers, and/or adversely affect our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner. Any material
disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Risks Related to Environmental, Social, and Governance Issues
Our business could suffer if we fail to meet our global citizenship and sustainability goals or if such goals do not meet the expectations of our
stakeholders
There is an increased focus from consumers, employees, investors, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social, and
governance ("ESG") matters, including climate change, and the related sustainability initiatives of companies. Furthermore, investors have placed increased
importance on the social cost of their investments. Although we have established certain long-term initiatives and goals regarding our impact on the
environment and society as a whole, including our diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, there can be no assurance that our various stakeholders will
agree with our initiatives or if we will be successful in achieving our goals by our targeted dates or at all. Further, we could incur additional costs, face market
and technological barriers, and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices. Our failure, or perceived failure, to
achieve our sustainability goals could damage the reputation of our brands and lead to adverse consumer actions and/or investment decisions by investors, as
well as our ability to attract and retain employees.
36


================================================================================
[PAGE 39 OF 281]
================================================================================
Climate change, or our ability to adhere to any legislation and regulatory requirements related to climate change, may adversely affect our business.
Our business is susceptible to risks associated with climate change, including potential disruptions to our retail stores, distribution centers, and
corporate facilities. Increased frequency and/or severity of adverse weather events due to climate change could adversely impact global supply chains,
including the availability and cost of raw materials (such as cotton, a key raw material used in the production of our products that is highly susceptible to
severe weather conditions), the ability of our manufacturers to fulfill our orders timely and to our specifications, and shipping disruptions and/or higher
freight costs. An increase in extreme weather conditions could also result in more frequent damage and/or closures of our stores and distribution centers,
adversely impact retail traffic, consumer's disposable income levels or spending habits on discretionary items, or otherwise disrupt business operations in the
communities in which we operate, any of which could result in lost sales or higher costs.
In addition, many countries in which we and our suppliers operate have begun enacting new legislation and regulations in an attempt to mitigate the
potential impacts of climate change, which could result in higher sourcing, operational, and compliance-related costs. Such proposed measures also include
expanded disclosure requirements regarding greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-related information, including independent auditors providing some
level of attestation to the accuracy of such disclosures. Our ability to comply with any such new laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and
operational complexity. Any failure on our part to comply with such climate change-related regulations could lead to adverse consumer actions and/or
investment decisions by investors, as well as expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation.
Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, and Tax Matters
Our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks.
Our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain our current level of operations in our existing markets is subject to
certain risks associated with operating in various locations around the globe. These include, but are not limited to:
•
complying with a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, trade, forced labor, product labeling, and
product safety restrictions, as well as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from making improper payments to
foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and similar foreign country laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, which
prohibits U.K. and related companies from any form of bribery;
•
adapting to local customs and culture;
•
unexpected changes in laws, judicial processes, or regulatory requirements;
•
the imposition of additional duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges or other barriers to trade;
•
changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;
•
civil and political instability, military conflicts, and terrorist attacks;
•
pandemic diseases, such as COVID-19; and
•
general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.
Changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social, economic, or monetary policies and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business in the
future or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices. For example, in recent years both the U.S. and
China have imposed new tariffs on each other related to the importation of certain product categories, including imports of apparel into the U.S. from China.
As a result of actions to mitigate our exposure to the resulting tariffs, which have included diverting production to and sourcing from other countries, driving
productivity within our existing supplier base, and taking pricing actions, the tariffs enacted to date have not had a material adverse impact on our business
operations. However, if the U.S. decides to impose additional tariffs on apparel or other of our goods imported from China, there can be no assurance that we
will be able to offset all related increased costs, which could be material to our business operations as approximately 19% of our products are sourced from
China. We cannot predict if, and to what extent, there will be changes to international trade agreements or the resulting impact any such changes would have
on our business operations, which could be material. For a discussion of risks associated with the importation of products, see "Risks Related to our Business
and Operations — Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and
to our specifications."
37


================================================================================
[PAGE 40 OF 281]
================================================================================
Our business could also be impacted by changes to the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. For example, the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (the "OECD"), which represents a coalition of member countries, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing
tax principles through its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among affiliated
entities located in different tax jurisdictions. In response, certain member countries have, or are otherwise planning to, implement legislation to align their
international tax rules with the OECD's recommendations. Additionally, the Biden Administration has proposed to increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate
from 21% up to as much as 28%, as well as increase U.S. taxation on foreign earnings. Other taxing authorities of certain state, local, and other foreign
jurisdictions may also decide to modify existing tax laws. We cannot predict which, if any, of these items or others will be enacted into law or the resulting
impact any such enactment will have on our business operations, which could be material.
Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results.
We are subject to income and non-income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, with the applicable tax rates varying by jurisdiction.
We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any
given time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect
the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events
occur and exposures are evaluated. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the mix and
level of earnings by jurisdiction or by changes to existing accounting rules. Additionally, our products are subject to import and excise duties, and/or sales,
consumption, value-added taxes ("VAT"), and other non-income taxes in certain international jurisdictions. Failure to correctly calculate or submit the
appropriate amount of income or non-income taxes could subject us to substantial fines and penalties and adversely affect our business.
In addition, the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate may change, or there may be changes in interpretation and enforcement of
existing tax laws, which could materially affect our income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of risks related to the
potential imposition of additional regulations and laws, see "Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, and Tax Matters — Our ability to conduct business globally
may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks."
Our business could suffer if we fail to comply with labor laws or if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental practices.
We are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, and
citizenship requirements. Compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental
investigations or litigation.
In addition, we require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While our
internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our employees periodically visit and monitor the operations of our
independent manufacturers, we do not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The violation of any ethical, social, product safety, labor, health,
environmental, privacy, or other standards and regulations by an independent manufacturer used by us or one of our licensing partners, could interrupt or
otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our
business.
Certain legal proceedings, regulatory matters, and accounting changes could adversely affect our business.
We are involved in certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters and are subject from time to time to various claims involving alleged breach of
contract claims, intellectual property and other related claims, escheatment and unclaimed property, credit card fraud, security breaches in certain of our retail
store information systems, employment issues, consumer matters, and other litigation. Certain of these lawsuits and claims, if decided adversely to us or
settled by us, could result in material liability to our Company or have a negative impact on our reputation or relations with our employees, customers,
licensing partners, or other third parties. Other potential claimants may also be encouraged to bring suits against us based on a settlement from us or adverse
court decision against us for similar claims or allegations as their own. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such
proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require our Company to devote substantial time and resources to defend itself. Further, changes in
governmental regulations both in the U.S. and in other
38


================================================================================
[PAGE 41 OF 281]
================================================================================
countries where we conduct business operations could have an adverse impact on our business. See Item 3 — "Legal Proceedings" for further discussion of
our Company's legal matters.
In addition, we are subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other regulatory
agencies. If and when effective, such changes to accounting standards could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 to
the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain recently issued accounting standards.
Risks Related to our Common Stock
The trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance,
including our ability to return value to shareholders.
Our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any
particular fiscal quarter. We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders. However, we also recognize that,
from time to time, it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our quarterly and annual forecast of net sales and earnings. While we generally
expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we do not have any responsibility to update any of our guidance or
other forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. In addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the
time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable. However, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and full fiscal year
expectations. Additionally, external analysts and investors may publish their own independent predictions of our future performance. We do not endorse such
predictions or assume any responsibility to correct such predictions when they differ from our own expectations. If, or when, we announce actual results that
differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside analysts, or others, the market price of our securities could be adversely affected. Investors who rely
on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered
as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.
The stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the
operating performance of listed companies. Accordingly, public perception and other factors outside of our control may impact our stock price, regardless of
our actual operating performance.
In addition, we have historically returned value to shareholders through our payment of quarterly cash dividends and common stock share repurchases.
Investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends, further increase our cash dividend rate, and/or repurchase shares
available under our Class A common stock repurchase program. Our ability to pay quarterly cash dividends and repurchase our Class A common stock will
depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive,
and other factors that are beyond our control, such as impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in us temporarily suspending our
quarterly cash dividend and share repurchases, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021. Although we have since resumed activity under both of
these programs during Fiscal 2022, our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, elect to suspend or otherwise alter these programs at any time. The market
price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend payments and/or Class A common stock share repurchase activity differ from investors'
expectations.
The voting shares of our Company's stock are concentrated in one majority stockholder.
As of April 2, 2022, Mr. Ralph Lauren, or entities controlled by the Lauren family, held approximately 85% of the voting power of the outstanding
common stock of our Company. In addition, Mr. R. Lauren serves as our Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, Mr. R. Lauren's son, Mr. David
Lauren, serves as our Chief Innovation Officer, Strategic Advisor to the CEO, and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, and we employ other members of
the Lauren family. From time to time, we may have other business dealings with Mr. R. Lauren, members of the Lauren family, or entities affiliated with Mr.
R. Lauren or the Lauren family. As a result of his stock ownership and position in our Company, Mr. R. Lauren has the ability to exercise significant control
over our business, including, without limitation, (i) the election of our Class B common stock directors, voting separately as a class and (ii) any action
requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or sales of all
or substantially all of our assets.

As of April 2, 2022, we directly operated 504 retail stores, totaling approximately 4.0 million square feet. We anticipate that we will be able to extend
our retail store leases, as well as those leases for our non-retail facilities, which expire in the near future on satisfactory terms or relocate to desirable alternate
locations. We generally lease our freestanding retail stores for initial periods ranging from 3 to 15 years, with renewal options. See Item  1A  —  "Risk
Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations — Our business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-
term, non-cancellable leases."
Item 3.    Legal Proceedings.
We are involved, from time to time, in litigation, other legal claims, and proceedings involving matters associated with or incidental to our business,
including, among other things, matters involving credit card fraud, trademark and other intellectual property, licensing, importation and exportation of
products, taxation, unclaimed property, leases, and employee relations. We believe at present that the resolution of currently pending matters will not
individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, our assessment of any current litigation or
other legal claims could potentially change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known or determinations by judges, juries, or other finders of fact
which are not in accord with management's evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or claims.

OVERVIEW
Our Business
Our Company is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear, accessories,
home furnishings, fragrances, and hospitality. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products,
brands, distribution channels, and international markets. Our brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Polo
Ralph Lauren, Double RL, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, and Chaps, among others.
We diversify our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and
licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or
channel of distribution. We sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-
shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-
party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which we have licensed the right to operate in defined geographic
territories using our trademarks. In addition, we license to third parties for specified periods the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the
licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.

================================================================================
[PAGE 46 OF 281]
================================================================================
We organize our business into the following three reportable segments:
•
North America — Our North America segment, representing approximately 48% of our Fiscal 2022 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of
our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S. and Canada. In North America, our retail
business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, and our digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.com. Our
wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department stores and, to a lesser extent, specialty stores.
•
Europe — Our Europe segment, representing approximately 28% of our Fiscal 2022 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph
Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Europe and emerging markets. In Europe, our retail business is
primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce
sites. Our wholesale business in Europe is comprised primarily of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores,
depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital partners.
•
Asia — Our Asia segment, representing approximately 21% of our Fiscal 2022 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren
branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Our retail business in Asia is primarily
comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites. In
addition, we sell our products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. Our wholesale business in Asia is comprised
primarily of sales to department stores, with related products distributed through shop-within-shops.
No operating segments were aggregated to form our reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable
segments, representing approximately 3% of our Fiscal 2022 net revenues, which primarily consist of Ralph Lauren and Chaps branded royalty revenues
earned through our global licensing alliances. In addition, prior to its disposition at the end of our first quarter of Fiscal 2022, our other non-reportable
segments also included sales of Club Monaco branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and our
licensing alliances in Asia. Refer to "Recent Developments" for additional discussion regarding the disposition of our former Club Monaco business, as well
as the recent transition of our Chaps business to a fully licensed business model.
Approximately 51% of our Fiscal 2022  net revenues were earned outside of the U.S. See Note 20 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.
Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale sales
in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods
impacting our retail business and timing of seasonal wholesale shipments. As a result of changes in our business, consumer spending patterns, and the
macroeconomic environment, including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events, historical quarterly operating trends and
working capital requirements may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating income (loss), and cash flows in
any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns.
Recent Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic
Beginning in the fourth quarter of our Fiscal 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19 emerged and spread rapidly
across the globe, including throughout all major geographies in which we operate, resulting in adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well
as significant volatility in global financial markets. Since then, governments worldwide have periodically imposed varying degrees of preventative and
protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such
factors, among others, have resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. Additionally, companies
across a wide array of industries have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating expenses and preserve cash balances during the pandemic,
including work furloughs, reduced pay, and severance actions, which could lower consumers' disposable income levels or willingness to purchase
discretionary items. Such government restrictions, company initiatives, and other macroeconomic impacts resulting from the pandemic could continue to
adversely affect consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences, such as willingness to congregate in indoor shopping centers or other
populated locations.
44


================================================================================
[PAGE 47 OF 281]
================================================================================
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of our stores, distribution
centers, and corporate facilities, as have our wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 at the
peak of the pandemic, the majority of our stores in key markets were closed for an average of 8 to 10 weeks due to government-mandated lockdowns and
other restrictions, resulting in significant adverse impacts to our operating results. Resurgences and outbreaks in certain parts of the world resulted in further
business disruptions periodically throughout Fiscal 2021, most notably in Europe where a significant number of our stores were closed for approximately two
to three months during the second half of Fiscal 2021, including during the holiday period, due to government-mandated lockdowns and other restrictions.
Such disruptions continued throughout Fiscal 2022 in certain regions, although to a lesser extent than the comparable prior year fiscal period. Further,
throughout the course of the pandemic, the majority of our stores that were able to remain open have periodically been subject to limited operating hours
and/or customer capacity levels in accordance with local health guidelines, with traffic remaining challenged. However, our digital commerce operations have
grown significantly from pre-pandemic levels, due in part to our investments and enhanced capabilities, as well as changes in consumer shopping preferences.
Our wholesale and licensing businesses have experienced similar impacts, particularly in North America and Europe.
The COVID-19 pandemic also continues to adversely impact our distribution, logistic, and sourcing partners, including temporary factory closures,
labor shortages, vessel, container and other transportation shortages, and port congestion. Such disruptions have reduced the availability of inventory, delayed
timing of inventory receipts, and resulted in increased costs for the both the purchase and transportation of such inventory.
Throughout the course of the pandemic, our priority has been to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and the communities in
which we operate around the world. We continue to consider the guidance of local governments and global health organizations and have implemented new
health and safety protocols in our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities. We also took various preemptive actions in the prior fiscal year to
preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position, as described in the Fiscal 2021 10-K. Such actions included, but were not limited to, issuing $1.250
billion of unsecured senior notes, temporarily suspending our quarterly cash dividend and common stock repurchase programs, temporarily reducing the base
compensation of our executives and senior management team, and temporarily furloughing or reducing work hours for a significant portion of our employees.
Despite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines and improvements in the global economy as a whole during Fiscal 2022, the pandemic remains
volatile and continues to evolve, including the emergence of variants of the virus, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, which has and could continue to
adversely affect consumer sentiment and confidence. Accordingly, we cannot predict for how long and to what extent the pandemic will continue to impact
our business operations or the overall global economy. We will continue to assess our operations location-by-location, considering the guidance of local
governments and global health organizations. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions — Infectious disease outbreaks,
such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business" for additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated
with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan
We have undertaken efforts to realign our resources to support future growth and profitability, and to create a sustainable, enhanced cost structure. The
key initiatives underlying these efforts involve evaluation of our: (i) team organizational structures and ways of working; (ii) real estate footprint and related
costs across our corporate offices, distribution centers, and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors; and (iii) brand portfolio.
In connection with the first initiative, on September 17, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the "Fiscal 2021 Strategic
Realignment Plan") to reduce our global workforce. Additionally, during a preliminary review of our store portfolio during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021,
we made the decision to close our Polo store on Regent Street in London.
Shortly thereafter, on October 29, 2020, we announced the planned transition of our Chaps brand to a fully licensed business model, consistent with our
long-term brand elevation strategy and in connection with our third initiative. Specifically, we have entered into a multi-year licensing partnership, which
took effect on August 1, 2021 following a transition period, with an affiliate of 5 Star Apparel LLC, a division of the OVED Group, to manufacture, market,
and distribute Chaps menswear and womenswear. The products are being sold at existing channels of distribution with opportunities for expansion into
additional channels and markets globally. This agreement created incremental value for the Company by enabling an even greater focus on elevating our core
brands in the marketplace, reducing our direct exposure to the North America department store channel, and setting up Chaps to deliver on its potential with
an experienced partner that is focused on nurturing the brand.
45


================================================================================
[PAGE 48 OF 281]
================================================================================
Later, on February 3, 2021, our Board of Directors approved additional actions related to our real estate initiative. Specifically, we are in the process of
further rightsizing and consolidating our global corporate offices to better align with our organizational profile and new ways of working. We also have
closed, and may continue to close, certain of our stores to improve overall profitability. Additionally, we further consolidated our North America distribution
centers in order to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability, and deliver a better consumer experience.
Finally, on June 26, 2021, in connection with our brand portfolio initiative, we sold our former Club Monaco business to Regent, L.P. ("Regent"), a
global private equity firm, with no resulting gain or loss on sale realized during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. Regent acquired Club Monaco's assets and
liabilities in exchange for potential future cash consideration payable to us, including earn-out payments based on Club Monaco meeting certain defined
revenue thresholds over a five-year period. Accordingly, we may realize amounts in the future related to the receipt of such contingent consideration.
Additionally, in connection with this divestiture, we are providing Regent with certain operational support for a transitional period of approximately 1 year,
varying by functional area.
In connection with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan, we have recorded cumulative pre-tax charges of $262.1 million, of which $25.3 million
and $236.8 million were recorded during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan were
substantially completed by the end of Fiscal 2022, with certain remaining actions expected to be completed during Fiscal 2023. We now expect total charges
of up to $300 million to be incurred in connection with this plan, consisting of cash-related charges of approximately $180 million and non-cash charges of
approximately $120 million. Actions associated with this plan are expected to result in gross annualized pre-tax expense savings of approximately $200
million, a portion of which is being reinvested back into the business.
See Note 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal
2021 Strategic Restructuring Plan.
Swiss Tax Reform
In May 2019, a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (the "Swiss Tax Act"),
which became effective January 1, 2020. The Swiss Tax Act eliminates certain preferential tax items at both the federal and cantonal levels for multinational
companies and provides the cantons with parameters for establishing local tax rates and regulations. The Swiss Tax Act also provides transitional provisions,
one of which allows eligible companies to increase the tax basis of certain assets based on the value generated by their business in previous years, and to
amortize such adjustment as a tax deduction over a transitional period.
In connection with this transitional provision, we recorded a one-time income tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset of $122.9 million during
Fiscal 2020, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3,760 basis points. Subsequently, during Fiscal 2021, we reduced this one-time tax benefit by $13.8
million due to new legislation enacted in connection with the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, which increased our effective rate by 1,840 basis
points.
Additionally, during Fiscal 2022, we recorded a charge of $6.4 million within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of
operations in connection with non-income-related capital taxes resulting from Swiss tax reform.
See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the Swiss Tax Act.
Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan
On June 4, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan associated with our strategic objective of operating with discipline to drive
sustainable growth (the "Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan"). The Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan included the following activities: (i) rightsizing and
consolidation of our global distribution network and corporate offices; (ii) targeted severance-related actions; and (iii) closure of certain of our stores and
shop-within-shops. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan resulted in gross annualized expense savings of approximately $80 million.
In connection with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan, we have recorded cumulative charges of $145.8 million since its inception, of which $48.5
million was recorded during Fiscal 2020. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan are complete and no additional charges are expected to
be incurred in connection with this plan.
See Note 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal
2019 Restructuring Plan.

Global Economic Conditions and Industry Trends
The global economy and retail industry are impacted by many different factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in heightened uncertainty
surrounding the future state of the global economy, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. As discussed in "Recent Developments,"
governments worldwide have periodically imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions throughout the course of the pandemic, such as
temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such actions, together with changes
in consumers' willingness to congregate in populated areas and lower levels of disposal income due to higher unemployment rates, have resulted in significant
business disruptions across a wide array of industries and an overall decline of the global economy since the outbreak of the pandemic. The COVID-19
pandemic has also significantly disrupted distribution, logistic, and supply chain operations globally, including temporary factory closures, labor shortages,
vessel, container and other transportation shortages, and port congestion. Such disruptions have reduced the availability of inventory, delayed timing of
inventory receipts, and resulted in increased costs for the both the purchase and transportation of such inventory. Despite the introduction of COVID-19
vaccines and improvements in the global economy as a whole during Fiscal 2022, resurgences and outbreaks continue to occur in certain geographic
locations, including those resulting from variants of the virus, such as the Delta and Omicron variants. Accordingly, it is not clear at this time how much
longer and to what extent the pandemic will last.
The global economy has also been negatively impacted by the war between Russia and Ukraine. Several countries, including the U.S., have imposed
significant economic sanctions against Russia, including export controls and other trade restrictions with Russian entities. Various companies have also
voluntarily elected to suspend operations in Russia in protest of the conflict. The Russia-Ukraine war has adversely impacted consumer sentiment and
confidence, particularly in Eastern Europe. It is not clear at this time how long the conflict will endure, or if it will escalate further with additional countries
declaring war against each other, which could further compound the adverse impact to the global economy. Certain other worldwide events and factors, such
as international trade relations, new legislation and regulations, taxation or monetary policy changes, political and civil unrest, and inflationary pressures,
including increases in the cost of raw materials, transportation, wages, healthcare and other benefit-related costs, among other factors, also increase volatility
in the global economy.
The retail landscape in which we operate has been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including periods of temporary closures of
stores and distribution centers and declines in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. The retail industry, particularly in the
U.S., has also experienced numerous bankruptcies, restructurings, and ownership changes in recent years. Despite improvements in the global economy
during Fiscal 2022, supply chain-related risks continue to exist as manufacturers and transportation providers alike are finding it difficult to meet increased
consumer demand. The continuation of these industry trends could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.
We have implemented various strategies globally to help address many of these current challenges and continue to build a foundation for long-term
profitable growth centered around strengthening our consumer-facing areas of product, stores, and marketing across channels and driving a more efficient
operating model. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during the prior fiscal year we took preemptive actions to preserve cash and strengthen our
liquidity position, which better enabled us to continue to execute upon our long-term growth strategy despite unfavorable economic conditions. Investing in
our digital ecosystem remains a primary focus and is a key component of our integrated global omni-channel strategy and driving consumer engagement,
particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has and could continue to reshape consumer shopping preferences. We continue to scale and
expand our Connected Retail capabilities to enhance the consumer experience, which now include virtual selling appointments, Buy Online-Pick Up in Store,
and mobile checkout and contactless payments, among other capabilities. In addition, we recently launched our first-ever, full-catalog Ralph Lauren mobile
shopping app. We also continue to drive consumer engagement and global brand awareness through our sports sponsorships, which include the Wimbledon,
U.S. Open, and Australian Open tennis tournaments, Team U.S.A in the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and various golf organizations and tournament
events, including the Professional Golfers' Association ("PGA") of America, the PGA Championship, the U.S. Golf Association, and the U.S. Ryder Cup
Team, as well as through our special product releases and limited collections. Additionally, we have accelerated our marketing investments, with a focus on
supporting new customer acquisition, digitally-amplified brand campaigns, and resumption of in-store programs as markets continue to reopen worldwide.
We also continue to take deliberate actions to ensure promotional consistency across channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience,
including better aligning shipments and inventory levels with underlying demand. We also remain committed to optimizing our wholesale distribution
channel and enhancing our department store consumer experience. In connection with our long-term brand elevation strategy, we completed the sale of our
former Club Monaco business at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022 and successfully transitioned our Chaps business to a fully licensed business model
during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022 as planned, thereby enabling our teams to focus our resources on our core brands.
47


================================================================================
[PAGE 50 OF 281]
================================================================================
We will continue to monitor these conditions and trends and will evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and foreign currency and cost
management opportunities to help mitigate the related impacts on our results of operations, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business
and protecting and elevating the value of our brand.
For a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see Part
I, Item 1A — "Risk Factors" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Summary of Financial Performance
Operating Results
In Fiscal 2022, we reported net revenues of $6.219 billion, net income of $600.1 million, and net income per diluted share of $8.07, as compared to net
revenues of $4.401 billion, a net loss of $121.1 million, and net loss per diluted share of $1.65 in Fiscal 2021. The comparability of our operating results has
been affected by adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions and net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other
benefits (charges), including one-time tax events, as well as the impacts of the disposition of our former Club Monaco business at the end of the first quarter
of Fiscal 2022, the transition of our Chaps business to a fully licensed business model during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, and the 53rd week in Fiscal
2022, as discussed further below.
Our operating performance for Fiscal 2022 reflected revenue increases of 41.3% on a reported basis and 41.9% on a constant currency basis, as defined
within "Transactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" below. The increase in net revenues reflected
growth across all regions largely driven by a reduction in store closures and other COVID-19-related disruptions experienced during the current fiscal year as
compared to the prior fiscal year, coupled with continued growth in our digital commerce operations and overall stronger consumer demand, as well as the
benefit of the incremental 53rd week. This growth was partially offset by the disposition of our former Club Monaco business at the end of the first quarter of
Fiscal 2022 and the transition of our Chaps business to a fully licensed business model during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022.
Our gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased by 170 basis points to 66.7% during Fiscal 2022, primarily driven by lower non-routine
inventory charges recorded during Fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as improved pricing, lower levels of promotional activity, and
product mix, partially offset by higher product and freight costs and the absence of unusual geographic and channel mix benefits experienced during the prior
fiscal year in connection with COVID-19-related business disruptions in North America and Europe.
Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses as a percentage of net revenues during Fiscal 2022 decreased by 680 basis points to 53.2%,
primarily driven by operating leverage on higher net revenues, partially offset by higher expenses across various categories to drive strategic growth, coupled
with the return to more normalized operations in comparison to the prior fiscal year.
Net income increased by $721.2 million to $600.1 million in Fiscal 2022 as compared to Fiscal 2021, primarily due to an $842.0 million increase in
our operating income, partially offset by a $108.2 million increase in our income tax provision. Net income per diluted share increased by $9.72 to $8.07 per
share during Fiscal 2022 driven by the higher level of net income.
During Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, our operating results were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and
certain other charges (benefits) totaling $32.6 million and $254.4 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $23.2 million,
or $0.31 per diluted share, and $201.5 million, or $2.71 per diluted share, respectively. Partially offsetting these charges was the favorable impact of the 53rd
week in Fiscal 2022, which increased net income by $16.5 million, or approximately $0.22 per diluted share. Our net loss during Fiscal 2021 also reflected
$46.6 million of incremental net tax expense recorded in connection with one-time income tax events.
Financial Condition and Liquidity
We ended Fiscal 2022 in a net cash and short-term investments position (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments, less total debt) of
$962.1 million, as compared to $1.144 billion as of the end of Fiscal 2021. The decrease in our net cash and short-term investments position during Fiscal
2022 as compared to Fiscal 2021 was primarily due to our use of cash to support Class A common stock repurchases of $492.6 million, including
withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards, to invest in our business through $166.9 million in capital expenditures,
and to make dividend payments of $150.0 million, partially offset by operating cash flows of $715.9 million.

[PAGE 51 OF 281]
================================================================================
Net cash provided by operating activities was $715.9 million during Fiscal 2022, as compared to $380.9 million during Fiscal 2021. The net increase in
cash provided by operating activities was due to an increase in net income before non-cash charges, partially offset by a net unfavorable change related to our
operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year period.
Our equity decreased to $2.536 billion as of April 2, 2022, compared to $2.604 billion as of March 27, 2021, due to our share repurchase activity and
dividends declared during Fiscal 2022, partially offset by our comprehensive income and the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements.
Transactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition
The comparability of our operating results for the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by certain events, including:
•
pretax charges incurred in connection with our restructuring activities, as well as certain other asset impairments and other benefits (charges),
including those related to COVID-19 business disruptions, as summarized below (references to "Notes" are to the notes to the accompanying

Fiscal 2020 includes a $7.1 million impairment of an equity method investment recorded within other income (expense), net in the
consolidated statements of operations. All other impairment charges were recorded within impairment of assets in the consolidated
statements of operations.
Non-routine bad debt reversals (expense), net are recorded within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Fiscal 2022
includes non-routine bad debt expense of $3.6 million recorded in connection with Russia-related accounts receivables, partially offset by
COVID-19-related bad debt expense reversals of $1.2 million. Non-routine bad debt reversals (expense) recorded during Fiscal 2021 and
Fiscal 2020 related to COVID-19 business disruptions.
Non-routine inventory benefits (charges) are recorded within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. Fiscal 2021
and Fiscal 2020 includes non-routine inventory charges of $8.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively, related to our restructuring plans (see
Note 9). All other non-routine inventory benefits (charges) related to COVID-19 business disruptions.
•
the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2022, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $62.7 million and net income of $16.5 million, or
approximately $0.22 per diluted share;
•
the disposition of our former Club Monaco business at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022, which resulted in a decline in net revenues of
approximately $66 million during Fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year;
•
the transition of our Chaps business to a fully licensed business model during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, which resulted in a decline in
net revenues of approximately $69 million during Fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year;
•
other adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020;

•
incremental net tax expense of $46.6 million recorded within our income tax provision during Fiscal 2021 related to a valuation allowance
provided against domestic losses attributable to COVID-19 business disruptions, international tax legislation enacted in connection with the
European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, and a

net operating loss carryback under the CARES Act, which collectively negatively impacted our effective tax rate by 6,230 basis points; and
•
a one-time benefit of $122.9 million recorded within our income tax provision during Fiscal 2020 in connection with the Swiss Tax Act, which
reduced our effective tax rate by 3,760 basis points. During Fiscal 2021, we reduced this one-time tax benefit by $13.8 million due to new
legislation enacted, which increased our effective tax rate by 1,840 basis points. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for further discussion.
Because we are a global company, the comparability of our operating results reported in U.S. Dollars is also affected by foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which we transact change in value over time compared to the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations can have a
significant effect on our reported results. As such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP"), our discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating current-year and prior-
year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. We present constant currency financial information,
which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to our reported operating results. We use constant currency information to provide a
framework for assessing how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe this information is
useful to investors for facilitating comparisons of operating results and better identifying trends in our businesses. The constant currency performance
measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Reconciliations between this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included in the "Results of
Operations" section where applicable.
Our discussion also includes reference to comparable store sales. Comparable store sales refer to the change in sales of our stores that have been open
for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales from our digital commerce sites are also included within comparable sales for those geographies that have been
serviced by the related site for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales for stores or digital commerce sites that are closed or shut down during the year are
excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of
25% or greater), or generally closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until
such stores have been operating in their new location or in their newly renovated state for at least 13 full fiscal months. All comparable store sales metrics are
calculated on a 52-week and constant currency basis.
Our "Results of Operations" discussion that follows includes the significant changes in operating results arising from these items affecting
comparability. However, unusual items or transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and other financial statement users should consider
the types of events and transactions that have affected operating trends.

Net Revenues.    Net revenues increased by $1.818 billion, or 41.3%, to $6.219 billion in Fiscal 2022 as compared to Fiscal 2021, including net
unfavorable foreign currency effects of $24.5 million. This increase also reflected the favorable impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2022, which resulted in
incremental net revenues of $62.7 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $1.842 billion, or 41.9%. The increase in net revenues
reflected growth across all regions largely driven by a reduction in store closures and other COVID-19-related disruptions experienced during the current
fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year, coupled with continued growth in our digital commerce operations and overall stronger consumer demand, as
well as the benefit of the incremental 53rd week as previously discussed. This growth was partially offset by the disposition of our former Club Monaco
business at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022 and the transition of our Chaps business to a fully licensed business model during the second quarter of
Fiscal 2022.

The $975.8 million net increase in North America net revenues was driven by:
•
a $664.5 million net increase related to our North America retail business, reflecting a reduction in store closures and other COVID-19-related
disruptions and the continued growth in our digital commerce operations, as well as the favorable impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2022. On a
constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $661.4 million, reflecting increases of $576.8 million in comparable store sales and $84.6
million in non-comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our North

•
a $311.3 million net increase related to our North America wholesale business largely driven by reduced shipments during the comparable prior
fiscal year period due to significant COVID-19-related business disruptions, coupled with overall stronger consumer demand. This growth was
partially offset by the transition of our Chaps business to a fully licensed business model during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, as well as
other strategic resets within our wholesale distribution channel.
Europe net revenues — Net revenues increased by $614.8 million, or 52.7%, during Fiscal 2022 as compared to Fiscal 2021, inclusive of the favorable
impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2022, which resulted in incremental net revenues of approximately $12 million related to our retail business. On a constant
currency basis, net revenues increased by $627.7 million, or 53.8%.
The $614.8 million net increase in Europe net revenues was driven by:
•
a $311.2 million net increase related to our Europe retail business, reflecting a reduction in store closures and other COVID-19-related
disruptions and the continued growth in our digital commerce operations, as well as the favorable impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2022. On a
constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $311.8 million, reflecting increases of $269.8 million in comparable store sales and $42.0

foreign currency effects of $12.3 million.
Asia net revenues — Net revenues increased by $259.3 million, or 25.2%, during Fiscal 2022 as compared to Fiscal 2021, inclusive of the favorable
impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2022, which resulted in incremental net revenues of approximately $21 million related to our retail business. On a constant
currency basis, net revenues increased by $275.3 million, or 26.8%.
The $259.3 million net increase in Asia net revenues was driven by:
•
a $239.0 million net increase related to our Asia retail business, reflecting a reduction in store closures and other COVID-19-related disruptions
and the continued growth in our digital commerce operations, as well as the favorable impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2022, partially offset by
net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $14.7 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $253.7 million, reflecting
increases of $145.2 million in comparable store sales and $108.5 million in non-comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the

a $20.3 million net increase related to our Asia wholesale business, reflecting increases most notably in Australia, South Korea, Southeast Asia,
and Japan.
Gross Profit.    Gross profit increased by $1.286 billion, or 44.9%, to $4.148 billion in Fiscal 2022, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects
of $18.9 million. Gross profit during Fiscal 2022 reflects non-routine inventory benefits of $13.3 million related to reversals of amounts previously recorded
in connection with COVID-19 business disruptions. In comparison, gross profit during Fiscal 2021 reflects non-routine inventory charges of $21.0 million
related to COVID-19 business disruptions and $8.3 million recorded in connection with our restructuring plans. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues
increased to 66.7% in Fiscal 2022 from 65.0% in Fiscal 2021. The 170 basis point improvement was primarily driven by lower non-routine inventory charges
recorded during Fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as improved pricing, lower levels of promotional activity, and product mix, partially
offset by higher product and freight costs and the absence of unusual geographic and channel mix benefits experienced during the prior fiscal year in
connection with COVID-19-related business disruptions in North America and Europe.
Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution
channels, changes in the mix of products sold, pricing, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in
material costs. These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.    SG&A expenses include costs relating to compensation and benefits, advertising and marketing, rent
and occupancy, distribution, information technology, legal, depreciation and amortization, bad debt, and other selling and administrative costs. SG&A
expenses increased by $667.1 million, or 25.3%, to $3.306 billion in Fiscal 2022, including net favorable foreign currency effects of $5.7 million. The
increase in SG&A expenses reflects a reduction in the magnitude of COVID-19 business disruptions and our related mitigating actions, which during the prior
fiscal year included (i) lower compensation-related expenses driven by employee furloughs and terminations, reduced pay for our executives, senior
management team, and Board of Directors, and COVID-19-related government subsidies, and (ii) lower rent and occupancy costs largely driven by reduced
percentage-of-sales-based rent due to widespread store closures and a reduction in traffic, as well as rent abatements negotiated with certain of our landlords.
The increase in SG&A expenses also reflects our investments to drive strategic growth, including our marketing and advertising initiatives, and higher non-
routine bad debt expense recorded during Fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by expense savings associated with the disposition
of our former Club Monaco business at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 53.2% in
Fiscal 2022 from 60.0% in Fiscal 2021. The 680 basis point decline was primarily driven by operating leverage on higher net revenues, partially offset by
higher expenses across various categories to drive strategic growth, coupled with the return to more normalized operations in comparison to the prior fiscal
year.

Impairment of Assets.     During Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $21.3 million and $96.0 million,
respectively, to write-down certain long-lived assets. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.   During Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, we recorded restructuring charges of $4.0 million and $159.1 million,
respectively, primarily consisting of severance and benefits costs and other cash charges, as well as other charges of $11.8 million and $11.4 million,
respectively, primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations for which the related lease
agreements have not yet expired. Additionally, during Fiscal 2022, we recognized $4.0 million of income primarily related to a certain revenue share clause in
our agreement with Regent that entitled us to receive a portion of the sales generated by the Club Monaco business during a four-month business transition
period. We donated this income to the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, a non-profit, charitable foundation, which resulted in a related offsetting $4.0
million donation expense recorded within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations during Fiscal 2022. We also
recorded a charge of $6.4 million during Fiscal 2022 in connection with non-income-related capital taxes resulting from Swiss tax reform. See Note 9 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Operating Income (Loss).    During Fiscal 2022, we reported operating income of $798.4 million, as compared to an operating loss of $43.6 million
during Fiscal 2021. The $842.0 million increase in operating income reflects the return to more normalized operations in comparison to the prior fiscal year
period, as previously discussed, as well as net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $13.2 million. Our operating results during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021
were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $32.6 million and $254.4
million, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues was 12.8% in Fiscal 2022, reflecting a 1,380 basis point improvement from Fiscal
2021. The improvement in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by lower net restructuring-related charges, impairment of
assets, and certain other charges (benefits) recorded during Fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year, the decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage
of net revenues, and the increase in our gross margin, all as previously discussed.

Reflects the disposition of our former Club Monaco business at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022.
North America operating margin improved by 600 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impacts of approximately 330 basis points and 170 basis
points related to our retail and wholesale businesses, respectively, both largely driven by a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues
resulting from operating leverage on higher net revenues. The basis point improvement of our retail business also reflected an increase in our gross margin,
while the improvement in our wholesale business reflected a decline in our gross margin. The overall improvement in operating margin also reflected the
favorable impact of 100 basis points attributable to lower impairment of assets and non-routine inventory charges during Fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior
fiscal year, partially offset by the absence of favorable non-routine bad debt expense adjustments recorded during the current fiscal year.

Europe operating margin improved by 870 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impacts of approximately 530 basis points and 320 basis points
related to our retail and wholesale businesses, respectively, both largely driven by a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues resulting from
operating leverage on higher net revenues. The overall improvement in operating margin also reflected the favorable impact of 90 basis points attributable to
lower impairment of assets during Fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by higher non-routine bad debt expense recorded during the
current fiscal year. These improvements in operating margin were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects and channel mix of approximately
40 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively.
Asia operating margin improved by 340 basis points, primarily due to the favorable impact of approximately 260 basis points related to our retail
business, largely driven by an increase in our gross margin and a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues. The overall improvement in
operating margin also reflected 40 basis points related to our wholesale business, largely driven by a decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net
revenues. The remaining 40 basis point improvement was primarily driven by favorable foreign currency effects.
Unallocated corporate expenses increased by $90.3 million to $667.3 million in Fiscal 2022. The increase in unallocated corporate expenses was due
to higher compensation-related expenses of $88.4 million, higher marketing and advertising expenses of $42.1 million, higher consulting fees of $13.8
million and higher other expenses of $11.7 million, partially offset by higher intercompany sourcing commission income of $43.3 million (which is offset at
the segment level and eliminates in consolidation) and lower impairment charges of $22.4 million.
Unallocated restructuring and other charges, net decreased by $148.3 million to $22.2 million in Fiscal 2022, as previously discussed above and in
Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Non-operating Income (Expense), Net.    Non-operating income (expense), net is comprised of interest expense, interest income, and other income
(expense), net, which includes foreign currency gains (losses), equity in income (losses) from our equity-method investees, and other non-operating expenses.
During Fiscal 2022, we reported non-operating expense, net, of $43.8 million, as compared to $31.2 million in Fiscal 2021. The $12.6 million increase in
non-operating expense, net was driven by:
•
a $5.5 million increase in interest expense, primarily driven by our finance leases, as well as the higher average level of outstanding debt during
Fiscal 2022 (see "Financial Condition and Liquidity — Cash Flows");
•
a $4.2 million decline in interest income, primarily driven by lower interest rates in financial markets; and
•
a $2.9 million decline in other income (expense), net, primarily driven by lower net foreign currency gains during Fiscal 2022 as compared to
the prior fiscal year period.
Income Tax Provision.    The income tax provision represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate will change from
period to period based on various factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted
tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies.
The income tax provision and effective tax rate in Fiscal 2022 were $154.5 million and 20.5%, respectively, as compared to $46.3 million and (61.9%),
respectively, in Fiscal 2021. The $108.2 million increase in our income tax provision was driven by the increase in our pretax income, as well as an increase
in our effective tax rate of 8,240 basis points. Our income tax provision in Fiscal 2021 reflected incremental tax expense of $33.7 million primarily related to
a valuation allowance provided against domestic losses attributable to significant COVID-19 business disruptions and $13.8 million related to international
tax legislation enacted in connection with the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, partially offset by an income tax benefit of $0.9 million
primarily due to a net operating loss carryback under the CARES Act. Collectively, this $46.6 million of net incremental tax expense impacted our prior fiscal
year effective tax rate by 6,230 basis points. The remaining 2,010 basis point increase in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by the impact of stock
compensation, favorable impact of the change in the geographic mix of our worldwide earnings, tax adjustments related to audit settlements, and certain
deferred tax adjustments, partially offset by $3.4 million related to a net operating loss carryback under the CARES Act. See Note 10 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

Net Income (Loss).    We reported net income of $600.1 million in Fiscal 2022, as compared to a net loss of $121.1 million in Fiscal 2021. The $721.2
million increase in net income was primarily due to the increase in our operating income, partially offset by the increase in our income tax provision, both as
previously discussed. Our operating results during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of
assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $32.6 million and $254.4 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by
$23.2 million and $201.5 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these charges was the favorable impact of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2022, which increased
net income by $16.5 million. Our net loss during Fiscal 2021 also reflected $46.6 million of incremental net tax expense recorded in connection with one-time
tax events, as previously discussed.
Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share.    We reported net income per diluted share of $8.07 in Fiscal 2022, as compared to a net loss per diluted share of
$1.65 in Fiscal 2021. The $9.72 per share increase was driven by the higher level of net income, as previously discussed. Net income per diluted share in
Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 were negatively impacted by $0.31 per share and $2.71 per share, respectively, related to net restructuring-related charges,
impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits), and favorably impacted by approximately $0.22 per share as a result of the 53rd week in Fiscal
2022, as previously discussed. Net loss per diluted share in Fiscal 2021 was also negatively impacted by $0.64 per share due to incremental net tax expense
recorded in connection with one-time tax events, as previously discussed.

North America net revenues — Net revenues decreased by $1.148 billion, or 36.6%, during Fiscal 2021 as compared to Fiscal 2020, on both a reported
and constant currency basis.
The $1.148 billion net decline in North America net revenues was driven by:
•
a $634.9 million net decrease related to our North America wholesale business, driven by COVID-19 business disruptions and continued
challenging department store traffic trends; and
•
a $513.2 million net decrease related to our North America retail business, inclusive of the adverse impact of COVID-19 business disruptions.
On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $513.1 million driven by decreases of $498.4 million in comparable store sales and
$14.7 million in non-comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our

Gross Profit.    Gross profit decreased by $791.9 million, or 21.7%, to $2.861 billion in Fiscal 2021, including net favorable foreign currency effects of
$60.2 million. Gross profit during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 reflects adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions, including incremental
inventory charges of $21.0 million and $157.3 million, respectively. Gross profit during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 also reflects inventory charges of $8.3
million and $2.2 million, respectively, recorded in connection with our restructuring plans. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 65.0% in
Fiscal 2021 from 59.3% in Fiscal 2020. The 570 basis point improvement was primarily driven by improved pricing and lower levels of promotional activity,
lower non-routine inventory charges recorded during Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, and favorable geographic and channel mix.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.    SG&A expenses decreased by $599.0 million, or 18.5%, to $2.639 billion in Fiscal 2021, including
net unfavorable foreign currency effect of $40.7 million. The decrease in SG&A expenses reflects impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions and our
related mitigating actions, including (i) lower compensation-related expenses largely driven by employee furloughs and terminations, reduced pay for our
executives, senior management team, and Board of Directors, and COVID-19-related government subsidies, (ii) lower rent and occupancy costs largely
driven by reduced percentage-of-sales-based rent due to store closures and a reduction in traffic, as well as rent abatements negotiated with certain of our
landlords, (iii) favorable COVID-19-related bad debt expense adjustments, and (iv) our operational discipline. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net
revenues increased to 60.0% in Fiscal 2021 from 52.6% in Fiscal 2020. The 740 basis point increase was primarily due to operating deleverage on lower net
revenues, partially offset by expense savings across various categories.

Impairment of Assets.     During Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $96.0 million and $31.6 million,
respectively, to write-down certain long-lived assets. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Restructuring and Other Charges, Net.   During Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, we recorded restructuring charges of $159.1 million and $37.6 million,
respectively, primarily consisting of severance and benefits costs, as well as other charges of $11.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively, primarily related to
rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations for which the related lease agreements had not yet expired.
Additionally, during Fiscal 2020, we recorded other charges of $20.8 million related to the charitable donation of the net cash proceeds received from the sale
of our corporate jet. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Operating Income (Loss).    During Fiscal 2021, we reported an operating loss of $43.6 million, as compared to operating income of $317.0 million
during Fiscal 2020. The $360.6 million decline in operating income reflects net adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions, partially offset by
net favorable foreign currency effects of $19.5 million. Our operating results during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 were also negatively impacted by
restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (a portion of which related to COVID-19 business disruptions) totaling $254.4
million and $321.8 million, respectively, as previously discussed. Operating loss as a percentage of net revenues was 1.0% in

North America operating margin improved by 230 basis points, primarily due to approximately 400 basis points attributable to net lower non-routine
inventory charges and COVID-19-related bad debt expense recorded during Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by higher
impairment of assets recorded during Fiscal 2021. Partially offsetting this net favorable improvement in operating margin were the unfavorable impacts of
approximately 90 basis points and 60 basis points attributable to our wholesale and retail businesses, respectively, both largely driven by an increase in SG&A
expenses as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by an increase in our gross margin. Our North America operating margin also reflected the
unfavorable impact of approximately 20 basis points attributable to other factors, including unfavorable channel mix.
Europe operating margin declined by 440 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of approximately 790 basis points related to our retail
business largely driven by an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by an increase in our gross margin. This decline in
operating income was partially offset by approximately 180 basis points attributable to favorable channel mix and 160 basis points attributable to net lower
non-routine inventory charges and COVID-19-related bad debt expense recorded during Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by
higher impairment of assets recorded during Fiscal 2021. The remaining change in operating margin was attributable to other factors, including slight
improvement in our wholesale business.
Asia operating margin improved by 210 basis points, primarily due to approximately 190 basis points attributable to net lower non-routine inventory
charges, COVID-19-related bad debt expense, and impairment of assets recorded during Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as favorable
foreign currency effects of approximately 60 basis points. The increase in operating margin also reflected the favorable impact of approximately 20 basis
points related to our retail business. These increases in operating margin were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points
related to our wholesale business largely driven by an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues. The remaining change in operating margin
was attributable to other factors, including unfavorable channel mix.
Unallocated corporate expenses decreased by $41.1 million to $577.0 million in Fiscal 2021. The decline in unallocated corporate expenses was due to
lower compensation-related expenses of $87.3 million and lower rent and occupancy costs of $24.3 million, partially offset by lower intercompany sourcing
commission income of $33.9 million (which is offset at the segment level and eliminates in consolidation), higher impairment of asset charges of $33.2
million, and higher other expenses of $3.4 million.
Unallocated restructuring and other charges, net increased by $103.3 million to $170.5 million in Fiscal 2021, as previously discussed above and in
Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Non-operating Income (Expense), Net.    During Fiscal 2021, we reported non-operating expense, net, of $31.2 million, as compared to non-operating
income, net, of $9.4 million in Fiscal 2020. The $40.6 million decline in non-operating income was driven by:
•
a $30.9 million increase in interest expense, primarily driven by the net increase in our borrowings during Fiscal 2021 (see "Financial Condition
and Liquidity — Cash Flows"); and
•
a $24.7 million decline in interest income, primarily driven by the decrease in our investment portfolio and lower interest rates in financial
markets.
These unfavorable variances were partially offset by a $15.0 million favorable change in other income (expense), net, primarily driven by the absence
of a $7.1 million impairment of an equity method investment recorded during Fiscal 2020, as well as higher net foreign currency gains during Fiscal 2021 as
compared to the prior fiscal year.
Income Tax Benefit (Provision).   We reported an income tax provision and effective tax rate of $46.3 million and (61.9%), respectively, in Fiscal 2021,
as compared to an income tax benefit and effective tax rate of $57.9 million and (17.7%), respectively, in Fiscal 2020. The $104.2 million increase in our
income tax provision was driven by the absence of a one-time benefit of $122.9 million recorded in connection with Swiss tax reform during the prior fiscal
year, which reduced our prior fiscal year effective tax rate by 3,760 basis points. Our income tax provision in Fiscal 2021 also reflected incremental tax
expense of $33.7 million primarily related to a valuation allowance provided against domestic losses attributable to significant COVID-19 business
disruptions and $13.8 million related to international tax legislation enacted in connection with the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, partially
offset by an income tax benefit of $0.9 million primarily due to a net operating loss carryback under the CARES Act. Collectively, this $46.6 million of net
incremental tax expense unfavorably impacted our Fiscal 2021 effective tax rate by 6,230 basis points. The remaining 1,950 basis point decline was
attributable to tax impacts on stock-based compensation, as well as the absence of favorable settlements of certain international income tax audits that
impacted the prior fiscal year. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the Swiss Tax Act.
Net Income (Loss).    We reported a net loss of $121.1 million in Fiscal 2021, as compared to net income of $384.3 million in Fiscal 2020. The $505.4
million decline in net income was primarily due to the decline in our operating income, the increase in our income tax provision, and higher non-operating
expense, net, all as previously discussed. Our operating results during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 included net restructuring-related charges, impairment of
assets, and certain other charges totaling $254.4 million and $321.8 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $201.5
million and $244.8 million, respectively. Net income (loss) during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 also reflected $46.6 million of incremental net tax expense and
an income tax benefit of $122.9 million, respectively, recorded in connection with one-time income tax events, as previously discussed.
Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share.    We reported a net loss per diluted share of $1.65 in Fiscal 2021, as compared to net income per diluted share of
$4.98 in Fiscal 2020. The $6.63 per share decline was due to the lower level of net income, as previously discussed. Net income (loss) per diluted share in
Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 were negatively impacted by $2.71 per share and $3.17 per share, respectively, as a result of net restructuring-related charges,
impairment of assets, and certain other charges, as previously discussed. Net income (loss) per diluted share in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 were also
negatively impacted by $0.64 per share due to incremental net tax expense and favorably impacted by $1.59 per share due to an income tax benefit,
respectively, recorded in connection with one-time tax events, as previously discussed.

See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the carrying values of our debt.
The decrease in our net cash and short-term investments position at April 2, 2022 as compared to March 27, 2021 was primarily due to our use of cash
to support Class A common stock repurchases of $492.6 million, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation
awards, to invest in our business through $166.9 million in capital expenditures, and to make dividend payments of $150.0 million partially offset by
operating cash flows of $715.9 million.
The decrease in our equity was attributable to our share repurchase activity and dividends declared during Fiscal 2022, partially offset by our
comprehensive income and the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.    Net cash provided by operating activities was $715.9 million during Fiscal 2022, as compared to $380.9
million during Fiscal 2021. The $335.0 million net increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to an increase in net income before non-cash
charges, partially offset by a net unfavorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior
fiscal year.
The net unfavorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, was primarily driven by:
•
a year-over-year increase in our inventory levels largely to support revenue growth, as well as higher goods-in-transit to mitigate ongoing global
supply chain delays;
•
a net unfavorable change in our accrued liabilities largely driven by an unfavorable change in our restructuring reserve due to a decrease in
restructuring charges recorded during Fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by a favorable change in our dividends
payable related to the temporary suspension and subsequent resumption of our quarterly cash dividend program; and

(a)
(a)

================================================================================
[PAGE 66 OF 281]
================================================================================
•
an unfavorable change related to our prepaid expenses and other current assets largely driven by an increase in non-trade receivables primarily
related to transition services being performed in connection with the disposition of our former Club Monaco business (see "Recent
Developments"), as well as the timing of cash payments; and
•
an unfavorable change related to our income tax receivables and payables largely driven by the timing of cash receipts and payments,
respectively.
These decreases related to our operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by:
•
a favorable change related to our accounts receivable, largely driven by a return to more normalized operations in comparison to the prior fiscal
year period.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities.    Net cash used in investing activities was $717.9 million during Fiscal 2022, as compared to cash
provided by investing activities of $195.0 million during Fiscal 2021. The $912.9 million net decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily
driven by:
•
an $848.6 million decrease in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, less purchases of investments. During Fiscal 2022, we made
net purchases of investments of $546.0 million, as compared to receiving net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $302.6
million during Fiscal 2021; and
•
a $59.1 million increase in capital expenditures. During Fiscal 2022, we spent $166.9 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $107.8
million during Fiscal 2021. Our capital expenditures during Fiscal 2022 primarily related to store openings and renovations, as well as
enhancements to our information technology systems.
In Fiscal 2023, we expect to spend approximately $290 million to $310 million on capital expenditures primarily related to store opening and
renovations, as well as enhancements to our information technology systems.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities.    Net cash used in financing activities was $665.7 million during Fiscal 2022, as compared to net
cash provided by financing activities of $356.8 million during Fiscal 2021. The $1.022 billion net decrease in cash provided by financing activities was
primarily driven by:
•
a $466.9 million decrease in cash proceeds from the issuance of debt, less debt repayments. During Fiscal 2022, we did not issue or repay any
debt. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2021, we received $1.242 billion in proceeds from the issuance of our 1.700% unsecured senior
notes and 2.950% unsecured senior notes, a portion of which was used to repay $475.0 million of borrowings previously outstanding under our
credit facilities and our previously outstanding $300.0 million principal amount of 2.625% unsecured senior notes that matured August 18,
2020;
•
a $454.9 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. During Fiscal 2022, we resumed activities under our
common stock repurchase program and repurchased $450.5 million of shares of our Class A common stock, and an additional $42.1 million in
shares of our Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards
under our long-term stock incentive plans. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2021, $37.7 million in shares of our Class A common stock
were surrendered or withheld for taxes; and
•
a $100.2 million increase in payments of dividends, driven by the reinstatement of our quarterly cash dividend program during Fiscal 2022 after
being temporarily suspended at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity
position, as discussed in "Dividends" below.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.    Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $380.9 million during Fiscal 2021, from $754.6
million during Fiscal 2020. The $373.7 million net decline in cash provided by operating activities was due to a decrease in net income before non-cash
charges, partially offset by a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal
year.
The net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, was primarily driven by:
•
a favorable change in our accrued liabilities, primarily driven by the increase in our restructuring reserve related to charges recorded in
connection with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan; and
•
a favorable change in our accounts payable, driven by our extended payment terms.
These increases related to our operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by:
•
an unfavorable change related to our accounts receivable, largely driven by an increase in wholesale revenue during the fourth quarter of Fiscal
2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020;
•
an unfavorable change in inventory, largely driven by lower COVID-19-related inventory charges recorded in Fiscal 2021 as compared to the
prior year period; and
•
an unfavorable change in our prepaid expenses and other current assets, primarily driven by the timing of cash payments.
Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities.    Net cash provided by investing activities was $195.0 million during Fiscal 2021, as compared to $702.1
million during Fiscal 2020. The $507.1 million net decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by:
•
a $648.1 million decrease in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, less purchases of investments. During Fiscal 2021, we received
net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $302.6 million, as compared to $950.7 million during Fiscal 2020.
    This decrease in cash provided by investing activities was partially offset by:
•
a $162.5 million decrease in capital expenditures. During Fiscal 2021, we spent $107.8 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $270.3
million during Fiscal 2020. This decline reflects the temporary postponement of non-critical capital expenditures as a preemptive action to
preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position in response to business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our capital
expenditures during Fiscal 2021 primarily related to international store openings and renovations, as well as enhancements to our information
technology systems.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities.    Net cash provided by financing activities was $356.8 million during Fiscal 2021, as compared
to net cash used in financing activities of $438.2 million during Fiscal 2020. The $795.0 million net increase in cash provided by financing activities was
primarily driven by:
65


================================================================================
[PAGE 68 OF 281]
================================================================================
•
a $657.1 million decrease in cash used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. During Fiscal 2021, $37.7 million in shares of
Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our
long-term stock incentive plans and no shares of Class A common stock were repurchased pursuant to our common stock repurchase program,
which was temporarily suspended as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position in response to business
disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2020, $650.3 million in shares of Class A common stock
were repurchased and $44.5 million in shares of Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes; and
•
a $154.1 million decrease in payments of dividends, driven by the temporary suspension of our quarterly cash dividend program as a preemptive
action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position, as discussed in "Dividends" below.
These increases in cash provided by financing activities were partially offset by:
•
an $8.1 million decrease in cash proceeds from the issuance of debt, less debt repayments. During Fiscal 2021, we received $1.242 billion in
proceeds from our issuance of 1.700% unsecured senior notes and 2.950% unsecured senior notes, a portion of which was used to repay $475
million of borrowings previously outstanding under our credit facilities and our previously outstanding $300 million principal amount of
2.625% unsecured senior notes that matured in August 2020. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2020 we borrowed $475 million under our
credit facilities as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations, our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments,
availability under our credit and overdraft facilities and commercial paper program, and other available financing options.
During Fiscal 2022, we generated $715.9 million of net cash flows from our operations. As of April 2, 2022, we had $2.598 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, of which $995.5 million were held by our subsidiaries domiciled outside the U.S. We are not dependent on foreign
cash to fund our domestic operations. Undistributed foreign earnings generated on or before December 31, 2017 that were subject to the one-time mandatory
transition tax in connection with U.S. tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") are not considered to be permanently
reinvested and may be repatriated to the U.S. in the future with minimal or no additional U.S. taxation. We intend to permanently reinvest undistributed
foreign earnings generated after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax. However, if our plans change and we
choose to repatriate post-2017 earnings to the U.S. in the future, we would be subject to applicable U.S. and foreign taxes.
The following table presents the total availability, borrowings outstanding, and remaining availability under our credit and overdraft facilities and
Commercial Paper Program as of April 2, 2022:

================================================================================
We amended the China Credit Facility during the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, whereby the borrowing capacity was increased to 100 million
Chinese Renminbi (approximately $16 million). Accordingly, our total availability under the Pan-Asia Credit Facilities was increased to
approximately $41 million during the first quarter of Fiscal 2023. See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the Global Credit Facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentration in any one financial institution. In particular, as of
April 2, 2022, there were eight financial institutions participating in the Global Credit Facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment
percentage in excess of 20%. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we have the ability to expand our borrowing availability under the Global Credit
Facility to $1 billion through the full term of the facility, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their
commitments.
Borrowings under the Pan-Asia Credit Facilities and Japan Overdraft Facility (collectively, the "Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities") are guaranteed by the
parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the participating banks (as described within Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements), subject to availability of the respective banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. We have no reason to believe that the
participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the Global Credit Facility and the Pan-
Asia Borrowing Facilities in the event of our election to draw additional funds in the foreseeable future.
Our sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, global retail store and digital
commerce expansion, construction and renovation of shop-within-shops, investment in infrastructure, including technology, acquisitions, joint ventures,
payment of dividends, debt repayments, Class A common stock repurchases, settlement of contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions), and other
corporate activities, including our restructuring actions. We believe that our existing sources of cash, the availability under our credit facilities, and our ability
to access capital markets will be sufficient to support our operating, capital, and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, the ongoing
development of our businesses, and our plans for further business expansion. However, prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business
disruptions in any of our key regions, or a combination thereof, such as those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events, could impede
our ability to pay our obligations as they become due or return value to our shareholders, as well as delay previously planned expenditures related to our
operations.
See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our credit facilities.
Debt and Covenant Compliance
In August 2018, we completed a registered public debt offering and issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due
September 15, 2025, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.750%, payable semi-annually (the "3.750% Senior Notes"). In June 2020, we completed another
registered public debt offering and issued an additional $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due June 15, 2022, which bear
interest at a fixed rate of 1.700%, payable semi-annually (the "1.700% Senior Notes"), and $750 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes
due June 15, 2030, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.950%, payable semi-annually (the "2.950% Senior Notes").
The indenture and supplemental indentures governing the 3.750% Senior Notes, 1.700% Senior Notes, and 2.950% Senior Notes (as supplemented, the
"Indenture") contain certain covenants that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions;
consolidate or merge with another party; or sell, lease, or convey all or substantially all of our property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does
not contain any financial covenants.
We have a credit facility that provides for a $500 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit through August 12, 2024, which is also used to
support the issuance of letters of credit and the maintenance of the Commercial Paper Program (the "Global Credit Facility"). Borrowings under the Global
Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and Japanese Yen. We have the ability to
expand the borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $1 billion, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the
facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility.

================================================================================
The Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants, as described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of
April 2, 2022, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility) has occurred under our Global Credit Facility. The Pan-
Asia Borrowing Facilities do not contain any financial covenants.
See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our debt and covenant compliance.
Common Stock Repurchase Program
Repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions, as well as other potential factors such as the
temporary restrictions previously in place under our Global Credit Facility. Accordingly, in response to business disruptions related to the COVID-19
pandemic, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, we temporarily suspended our common stock repurchase program as a preemptive action to
preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position. However, we resumed activities under our Class A common stock repurchase program during the third
quarter of Fiscal 2022 as restrictions under our Global Credit Facility were lifted (see Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and
overall business and market conditions have improved since the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged.
On February 2, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our existing common stock repurchase program that allowed us to repurchase
up to an additional $1.500 billion of our Class A common stock. As of April 2, 2022, the remaining availability under our Class A common stock repurchase
program was approximately $1.629 billion.
See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our Class A common stock repurchase
program.
Dividends
Except as discussed below, we have maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on our common stock since 2003.
In response to business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 we temporarily suspended
our quarterly cash dividend program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position. On May 19, 2021, our Board of Directors
approved the reinstatement of our quarterly cash dividend program at the pre-pandemic amount of $0.6875 per share.
On May 18, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.6875 to $0.75 per share.
The first quarterly dividend declared to reflect this increase will be payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2022 and will be paid
on July 15, 2022.
We intend to continue to pay regular dividends on outstanding shares of our common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the
future will ultimately be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition,
and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, including economic and market conditions.
See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our quarterly cash dividend program.

The following is a description of our material, firmly committed obligations as of April 2, 2022:
•
Senior Notes represent the principal amount of our outstanding 3.750% Senior Notes, 1.700% Senior Notes, and 2.950% Senior Notes. Amounts
do not include any call premiums, unamortized debt issuance costs, or interest payments (see below);
•
Interest payments on debt represent the semi-annual contractual interest payments due on our 3.750% Senior Notes, 1.700% Senior Notes, and
2.950% Senior Notes. Amounts do not include the impact of potential cash flows underlying our related swap contracts (see Note 13 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our swap contracts);
•
Lease obligations represent fixed payments due over the lease term of our noncancelable leases of real estate and operating equipment,
including rent, real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance fees, and/or certain other costs. For lease terms that have commenced,
information has been presented separately for operating and finance leases. Other lease commitments relate to executed lease agreements for
which the related lease terms have not yet commenced as of April 2, 2022;
•
Inventory purchase commitments represent our legally-binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable
prices;
•
Mandatory transition tax payments represent our remaining tax obligation incurred in connection with the deemed repatriation of previously
deferred foreign earnings pursuant to the TCJA (see Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the TCJA);
and
•
Other commitments primarily represent our legally-binding obligations under sponsorship, licensing, and other marketing and advertising
agreements; information technology-related service agreements; and pension-related obligations.
Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $91.9 million as of April 2, 2022, as
we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. The above table also excludes the following: (i) amounts
recorded in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of April  2, 2022, which will be paid within one year, other than lease obligations,
mandatory transition tax payments, and accrued interest payments on debt; and (ii) non-current liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them
(e.g., deferred income), or the cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do not represent a "purchase obligation" as such term is used herein (e.g.,
deferred taxes, derivative financial instruments, and other miscellaneous items).

We also have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments if certain events or circumstances occur. See Note 15 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our contingent commitments not included in the above table.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In addition to the commitments included in the above table, our other off-balance sheet firm commitments relating to our outstanding letters of credit
amounted to $9.5 million as of April 2, 2022. We do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations, or other relationships
with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements.
MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
As discussed in Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we are exposed to a variety of levels and types of risks, including the
impact of changes in currency exchange rates on foreign currency-denominated balances, certain anticipated cash flows of our international operations, and
the value of reported net assets of our foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations relating to fluctuations in
benchmark interest rates. Accordingly, in the normal course of business we assess such risks and, in accordance with our established policies and procedures,
may use derivative financial instruments to manage and mitigate them. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Given our use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual
obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, it is our policy to only enter into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon an
evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. Our established policies and procedures for
mitigating credit risk include ongoing review and assessment of the creditworthiness of our counterparties. We also enter into master netting arrangements
with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. As a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to undue
concentration of counterparty risk with respect to our derivative contracts as of April 2, 2022. However, we do have in aggregate $32.6 million of derivative
instruments in net asset positions held across six creditworthy financial institutions.
Foreign Currency Risk Management
We manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates using forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts.
Refer to Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the notional amounts and fair values of our outstanding forward
foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts, as well as the impact on earnings and other comprehensive income of such instruments for the
fiscal periods presented.
Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts
We enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an
entity's non-functional currency, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net assets into
U.S. Dollars. As part of our overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the Japanese Yen,
the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi, we generally
hedge a portion of our related exposures anticipated over the next twelve months using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with maturities of two
months to one year to provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure.
Our foreign exchange risk management activities are governed by established policies and procedures. These policies and procedures provide a
framework that allows for the management of currency exposures while ensuring the activities are conducted within our established guidelines. Our policies
include guidelines for the organizational structure of our risk management function and for internal controls over foreign exchange risk management
activities, including, but not limited to, authorization levels, transaction limits, and credit quality controls, as well as various measurements for monitoring
compliance. We monitor foreign exchange risk using different techniques, including periodic review of market values and performance of sensitivity analyses.

================================================================================
Cross-Currency Swap Contracts
We periodically designate pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contracts as hedges of our net investment in certain European
subsidiaries.
Our pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contracts swap U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed interest rate payments based on the contract's
notional amount and the fixed rate of interest payable on certain of our senior notes for Euro-denominated fixed interest rate payments, thereby economically
converting a portion of our fixed-rate U.S. Dollar-denominated senior note obligations to fixed rate Euro-denominated obligations.
See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our foreign currency exposures and the types of derivative
instruments used to hedge those exposures.
Sensitivity
We perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our forward foreign currency
exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. In doing so, we assess the risk of loss in the fair values of these contracts that would result from hypothetical
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by the foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. Dollar.
As of April 2, 2022, a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies under contract would result in a net increase or
decrease, respectively, in the fair value of our derivative portfolio of approximately $113 million. This hypothetical net change in fair value should ultimately
be largely offset by the net change in the related underlying hedged items.
Interest Rate Risk Management
Sensitivity
As of April 2, 2022, we had no variable-rate debt outstanding. As such, our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily relates to changes in the fair
values of our fixed-rate Senior Notes. As of April 2, 2022, the aggregate fair values of our Senior Notes were $1.629 billion. A 25-basis point increase or
decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase, respectively, the aggregate fair values of our Senior Notes by approximately $16.5 million based on
certain simplifying assumptions, including an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes
for the remainder of the period. Such potential increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt would only be realized if we were to retire all or a portion of
the debt prior to its maturity.
Investment Risk Management
As of April 2, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents on-hand of $1.864 billion, consisting of deposits in interest bearing accounts, investments in
money market deposit accounts, and investments in time deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less. Our other significant investments included
$734.6 million of short-term investments, consisting of investments in time deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days.
We actively monitor our exposure to changes in the fair value of our global investment portfolio in accordance with our established policies and
procedures, which include monitoring both general and issuer-specific economic conditions, as discussed in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. Our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit
risk, and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy. See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for further detail of the composition of our investment portfolio as of April 2, 2022.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and requires
significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, assessments of
probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other
professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts.
We believe that the following list represents our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, including our
critical accounting policies, see Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

================================================================================
Sales Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts
A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue involves estimating sales reserves, which represent the portion of gross revenues not
expected to be realized. In particular, gross revenue related to our wholesale business is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns,
operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances. Gross revenue related to our retail business, including digital commerce sales, is also
reduced by an estimate of returns.
In developing estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and cooperative advertising allowances, we analyze
historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, current economic and market conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms.
Estimates for operational chargebacks are based on actual customer notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and historical trends. We review and refine
these estimates on a quarterly basis. Our historical estimates of these amounts have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse
future economic and market conditions, such as those resulting from widespread pandemic diseases and/or other catastrophic events, could result in our actual
results differing materially from our estimates. A hypothetical 1% increase in our reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational
chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances as of April 2, 2022 would have reduced our Fiscal 2022 net revenues by approximately $2
million.
Similarly, we evaluate our accounts receivable balances to develop expectations regarding the extent to which they will ultimately be collected.
Significant judgment and estimation are involved in this evaluation, including a receivables aging analysis which shows, by aged category, the percentage of
receivables that has historically gone uncollected, an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts (including consideration of
their financial condition and ability to withstand potential prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions), and an evaluation of current and forecasted
economic and market conditions over the respective asset's contractual life. Based on this information, we record an allowance for estimated amounts that we
ultimately expect not to collect due to credit. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for these risks as part of our allowance for doubtful
accounts, a severe and prolonged adverse impact on our major customers' business and operations beyond those forecasted could have a corresponding
material adverse effect on our net revenues, cash flows, and/or financial condition. A hypothetical 1% increase in the level of our allowance for doubtful
accounts as of April 2, 2022 would have increased our Fiscal 2022 SG&A expenses by less than $1 million.
See "Accounts Receivable" in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our sales reserves and
allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal years presented.
Inventories
We hold retail inventory that is sold in our own stores and digital commerce sites directly to consumers. We also hold inventory that is sold through
wholesale distribution channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores. Substantially all of our inventories are comprised of finished goods,
which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted-average cost basis.
The estimated net realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual product lines, the impact
of market trends and economic conditions (including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events), and a forecast of future demand,
giving consideration to the value of current orders in-house for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell inventory through our factory stores, among
other liquidation channels. Actual results may differ from estimates due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer
preferences, and economic and market conditions. Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on
historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. Our historical estimates of these costs and the related provisions have not
differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions could result in our actual results differing
materially from our estimates.
A hypothetical 1% increase in the level of our inventory reserves as of April  2, 2022 would have decreased our Fiscal 2022 gross profit by
approximately $2 million.

Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with
other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be
fully recoverable.
We generally perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. However, in order to reassess the fair values of our reporting units, we periodically
perform a quantitative impairment analysis in lieu of using the qualitative approach.
Performance of the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment requires judgment in identifying and considering the significance of relevant key
factors, events, and circumstances that affect the fair values of our reporting units. This requires consideration and assessment of external factors such as
macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as our actual and planned financial performance. We also give
consideration to the difference between each reporting unit's fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date that a fair value measurement was
performed. If the results of the qualitative assessment conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying
value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed.
The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair
value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not to be impaired. However, if the carrying value of a
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Any impairment charge recognized is limited to the
amount of the respective reporting unit's allocated goodwill.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires judgment and often involves the use of
significant estimates and assumptions, including an assessment of external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-
specific factors, such as actual and planned financial performance. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used when determining the fair values of other
indefinite-lived intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and
the magnitude of any such charge. To assist management in the process of determining any potential goodwill impairment, we may review and consider
appraisals from accredited independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons,
and recent transactions. These approaches involve significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount
rates reflecting the risks inherent in those future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, and selection of appropriate market comparable metrics and transactions.
We performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2022 using the qualitative approach
discussed above. In performing the assessment, we considered the results of our most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test, which was performed as
of the end of Fiscal 2020 and incorporated assumptions related to COVID-19 business disruptions, the results of which indicated that the fair values of our
reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. Based on the results of the qualitative impairment assessment performed, we concluded
that it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and there were no reporting
units at risk of impairment. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded during any of the fiscal years presented. See Note 12 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
In evaluating finite-lived intangible assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition where probable. If such estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an
impairment loss is recognized to the extent that such asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, as estimated considering external market participant
assumptions.
It is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for
example, (i) our businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in future years vary from current assumptions, (iii) business
conditions or strategies change from our current assumptions, or (iv) the identification of our reporting units change, among other factors. Such changes could
result in a future impairment charge of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
or results of operations.
73


================================================================================
[PAGE 76 OF 281]
================================================================================
Impairment of Other Long-Lived Assets
Property and equipment and lease-related right-of-use ("ROU") assets, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets for
recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (including any potential sublease income for lease-
related ROU assets) and its eventual disposition, where applicable. If such estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than
its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that such asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, as estimated considering external
market participant assumptions and discounted cash flows, including those based on estimated market rents for lease-related ROU assets. Assets to be
disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal (commonly referred to as assets held-for-sale) are reported at the lower of carrying value or
fair value, less costs to sell.
In determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost
controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local
advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, future impairments may arise in the event that future cash
flows do not meet expectations. For example, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions could negatively impact consumer behavior,
spending levels, and/or shopping preferences and result in actual results differing from our estimates. Additionally, we may review and consider appraisals
from accredited independent valuation firms to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, where applicable.
During Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $21.3 million, $96.0 million, and $38.7 million,
respectively, to write-down the carrying values of certain long-lived assets based upon their assumed fair values. See Note 8 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Income Taxes
In determining our income tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If we believe that a tax
position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the tax benefit. We measure
the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is
examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and require significant
judgment, and we often obtain assistance from external advisors. To the extent that our estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different
from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. If the initial
assessment of a position fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we will recognize the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case
law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) the statute of limitations expires; or
(iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency.
Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating losses, capital losses, general business credit carryforwards, and the net tax effects
of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted
tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax
asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, which typically
involves the use of significant estimates. Such allowances are adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances.
See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes.
Contingencies
We are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including potential losses relating to certain
litigation, alleged information system security breaches, contractual disputes, employee relation matters, various tax or other governmental audits, and
trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a
loss has been incurred and the amount of such loss is reasonably estimable. In addition, if it is considered reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement
of a contingency could exceed any established liability, we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, if
practicable. Management considers many factors in making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these
assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties,
and governmental actions. As a
74


================================================================================
[PAGE 77 OF 281]
================================================================================
result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on management's judgment in developing the related estimates and assumptions.
Stock-Based Compensation
We expense all stock-based compensation awarded to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the
requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures which are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and expected future trends.
Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")
We grant service-based RSUs to certain of our senior executives and other employees, as well as to our non-employee directors. In addition, we grant
RSUs with performance-based and market-based vesting conditions to such senior executives and other key employees.
The fair values of our service-based RSU and performance-based RSU awards are measured based on the fair value of our Class A common stock on
the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and
unvested. Related compensation expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized over the employees' requisite service period, to the extent that our
attainment of performance goals (upon which vesting is dependent) is deemed probable, and involves judgment as to expectations surrounding our
achievement of certain defined operating performance metrics.
The fair value of our market-based RSU awards, for which vesting is dependent upon total shareholder return ("TSR") of our Class A common stock
over a three-year performance period relative to that of a pre-established peer group, is measured on the grant date based on estimated projections of our
relative TSR over the performance period. These estimates are made using a Monte Carlo simulation, which models multiple stock price paths of our Class A
common stock and that of the peer group to evaluate and determine our ultimate expected relative TSR performance ranking. Related compensation expense,
net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied. See Note 18 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Stock Options
Stock options have been granted to employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our Class A common
stock on the date of grant. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options, which requires the use of both
subjective and objective assumptions. Certain key assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the estimation process
include the expected term of the option, expected volatility of our stock price, our expected dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate, among others.
Generally, once stock option values are determined, accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from
actual results.
No stock options were granted during any of the fiscal years presented. See Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further
discussion.
Sensitivity
The assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair values of our stock-based compensation awards represent our best estimates. In addition,
projecting the achievement level of certain performance-based awards, as well as estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited, requires
judgment. If actual results or forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions, or if assumptions used to estimate the grant date fair value of
future stock-based award grants are significantly changed, stock-based compensation expense and, therefore, our results of operations could be materially
impacted. A hypothetical 10% change in our Fiscal 2022 stock-based compensation expense would have affected our net income by approximately $7
million.

See the "Index to Consolidated Financial Statements" appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
Not applicable.
Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures.
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it
files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers,
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end
of the fiscal year covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level, as of the fiscal year-end covered by this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.
(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Securities Exchange Act
Rule  13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Internal control over financial
reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company's assets
are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Company's assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be
prevented or detected. Further, the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as of a specific date, and continued
effectiveness in future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance
with the policies and procedures may decline.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report based on the framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on
this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal controls over financial reporting were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the
fiscal year-end covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control
over financial reporting as included elsewhere herein.

(c) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Although there have been no material changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting, we continue to experience varying degrees of
business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including periods of temporary closure of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities, as
described within Item 1 — "Business — Recent Developments," with a significant portion of our corporate employees continuing to work remotely.
Additionally, in connection with our Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan, as described within Item 1 — "Business — Recent Developments," we made a
significant reduction to our global workforce during the second half of Fiscal 2021. Despite such cumulative actions, we have not experienced any material
changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate and monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our
restructuring activities on our internal controls. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions — Infectious disease outbreaks,
such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business" and "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Strategic Initiatives and
Restructuring Activities —  We may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring plans" for additional
discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our restructuring plans, respectively.

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.    Description of Business
Ralph Lauren Corporation ("RLC") is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel,
footwear, accessories, home furnishings, fragrances, and hospitality. RLC's long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide
range of products, brands, distribution channels, and international markets. RLC's brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren
Purple Label, Polo Ralph Lauren, Double RL, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, and Chaps, among others. RLC and its subsidiaries are
collectively referred to herein as the "Company," "we," "us," "our," and "ourselves," unless the context indicates otherwise.
The Company diversifies its business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail,
wholesale, and licensing). This allows the Company to maintain a dynamic balance as its operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any
single geographic area or channel of distribution. The Company sells directly to consumers through its integrated retail channel, which includes its retail
stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. The Company's wholesale sales are made principally to
major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which the
Company has licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using its trademarks. In addition, the Company licenses to third parties for
specified periods the right to access its various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain
apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.
The Company organizes its business into the following three reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to these reportable
segments, the Company also has other non-reportable segments. See Note 20 for further discussion of the Company's segment reporting structure.
2.    Basis of Presentation
Basis of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP")
and present the consolidated financial position, income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows of the Company, including all entities in which
the Company has a controlling financial interest and is determined to be the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
Additionally, as discussed in Note 9, the Company completed the sale of its Club Monaco business at the end of its first quarter of Fiscal 2022 (as
defined below) on June 26, 2021. As a result, assets and liabilities related to the Club Monaco business were deconsolidated from the consolidated statement
of financial position effective June 26, 2021, with Club Monaco's operating results included in the consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive
income (loss), and cash flows through the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. Prior year financial statements were not affected.
Fiscal Year
The Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday immediately before or after March 31. As such, fiscal year 2022 ended on
April 2, 2022 and was a 53-week period ("Fiscal 2022"); fiscal year 2021 ended on March 27, 2021 and was a 52-week period ("Fiscal 2021"); fiscal year
2020 ended on March 28, 2020 and was a 52-week period ("Fiscal 2020"); and fiscal year 2023 will end on April 1, 2023 and will be a 52-week period
("Fiscal 2023").
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and notes thereto. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
F-7


================================================================================
[PAGE 94 OF 281]
================================================================================

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include reserves for bad debt, customer returns, discounts,
end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances; the realizability of inventory; reserves for litigation and
other contingencies; useful lives and impairments of long-lived tangible and intangible assets; fair value measurements; accounting for income taxes and
related uncertain tax positions; valuation of stock-based compensation awards and related forfeiture rates; and reserves for restructuring activity, among
others.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods' financial information in order to conform to the current period's presentation.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Beginning in the fourth quarter of the Company's Fiscal 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19 emerged and spread
rapidly across the globe, including throughout all major geographies in which the Company operates, resulting in adverse economic conditions and business
disruptions, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. Since then, governments worldwide have periodically imposed varying degrees of
preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of
the virus. Such factors, among others, have resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items.
Additionally, companies across a wide array of industries have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating expenses and preserve cash balances
during the pandemic, including work furloughs, reduced pay, and severance actions, which could lower consumers' disposable income levels or willingness to
purchase discretionary items. Such government restrictions, company initiatives, and other macroeconomic impacts resulting from the pandemic could
continue to adversely affect consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences, such as willingness to congregate in indoor shopping centers or
other populated locations.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of its stores,
distribution centers, and corporate facilities, as have the Company's wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors. During the first quarter
of Fiscal 2021 at the peak of the pandemic, the majority of the Company's stores in key markets were closed for an average of 8 to 10 weeks due to
government-mandated lockdowns and other restrictions, resulting in significant adverse impacts to its operating results. Resurgences and outbreaks in certain
parts of the world resulted in further business disruptions periodically throughout Fiscal 2021, most notably in Europe where a significant number of the
Company's stores were closed for approximately two to three months during the second half of Fiscal 2021, including during the holiday period, due to
government-mandated lockdowns and other restrictions. Such disruptions continued throughout Fiscal 2022 in certain regions, although to a lesser extent than
the comparable prior year fiscal period. Further, throughout the course of the pandemic, the majority of the Company's stores that were able to remain open
have periodically been subject to limited operating hours and/or customer capacity levels in accordance with local health guidelines, with traffic remaining
challenged. However, the Company's digital commerce operations have grown significantly from pre-pandemic levels, due in part to our investments and
enhanced capabilities, as well as changes in consumer shopping preferences. The Company's wholesale and licensing businesses have experienced similar
impacts, particularly in North America and Europe.
The COVID-19 pandemic also continues to adversely impact the Company's distribution, logistic, and sourcing partners, including temporary factory
closures, labor shortages, vessel, container and other transportation shortages, and port congestion. Such disruptions have reduced the availability of
inventory, delayed timing of inventory receipts, and resulted in increased costs for the both the purchase and transportation of such inventory.
Throughout the course of the pandemic, the Company's priority has been to ensure the safety and well-being of its employees, customers, and the
communities in which it operates around the world. The Company continues to consider the guidance of local governments and global health organizations
and has implemented new health and safety protocols in its stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities. The Company also took various preemptive
actions in the prior fiscal year to preserve cash and strengthen its liquidity position, as described in the Fiscal 2021 10-K. Such actions included, but were not
limited to, issuing $1.250 billion of unsecured senior notes, temporarily suspending the Company's quarterly cash dividend and common stock repurchase
programs, temporarily reducing the base compensation of its executives and senior management team, and temporarily furloughing or reducing work hours
for a significant portion of its employees.

================================================================================

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Despite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines and improvements in the global economy as a whole during Fiscal 2022, the pandemic remains
volatile and continues to evolve, including the emergence of variants of the virus, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, which has and could continue to
adversely affect consumer sentiment and confidence. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict for how long and to what extent the pandemic will continue to
impact its business operations or the overall global economy. The Company will continue to assess its operations location-by-location, considering the
guidance of local governments and global health organizations.
3.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue across all channels of the business when it satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of promised
products or services to its customers, which occurs either at a point in time or over time, depending on when the customer obtains the ability to direct the use
of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services. The amount of revenue recognized considers terms of sale that create
variability in the amount of consideration that the Company ultimately expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products or services, and is subject to an
overall constraint that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. Sales and other related taxes collected from customers and remitted to
government authorities are excluded from revenue.
Revenue from the Company's retail business is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of the products, which occurs either at the
point of sale for merchandise purchased at the Company's own retail stores and shop-within-shop locations, or upon receipt of shipment for merchandise
ordered through direct-to-consumer digital commerce sites. Such revenues are recorded net of estimated returns based on historical trends. Payment is due at
the point of sale.
Gift cards purchased by customers are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed for products sold by the Company's retail business, at which point
revenue is recognized. The Company also estimates and recognizes revenue for gift card balances not expected to ever be redeemed (referred to as
"breakage") to the extent that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or
abandoned property. Such estimates are based upon historical redemption trends, with breakage income recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual
customer redemptions.
Revenue from the Company's wholesale business is generally recognized upon shipment of products, at which point title passes and risk of loss is
transferred to the customer. In certain arrangements where the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment, revenue is recognized upon receipt of
products by the customer. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and
certain cooperative advertising allowances. Returns and allowances require pre-approval from management and discounts are based on trade terms. Estimates
for end-of-season markdown reserves are based on historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic and market
conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms. Estimates for operational chargebacks are based on actual customer notifications of
order fulfillment discrepancies and historical trends. The Company reviews and refines these estimates on at least a quarterly basis. The Company's historical
estimates of these amounts have not differed materially from actual results.
Revenue from the Company's licensing arrangements is recognized over time during the period that licensees are provided access to the Company's
trademarks (i.e., symbolic intellectual property) and benefit from such access through their own sales of licensed products. These arrangements require
licensees to pay a sales-based royalty, which for most arrangements, may be subject to a contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Payments are
generally due quarterly and, depending on time of receipt, may be recorded as a liability until recognized as revenue. The Company recognizes revenue for
sales-based royalty arrangements (including those for which the royalty exceeds any contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount) as licensed products
are sold by the licensee. If a sales-based royalty is not ultimately expected to exceed a contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount, the minimum is
generally recognized as revenue ratably over the respective contractual period. This sales-based output measure of progress and pattern of recognition best
represents the value transferred to the licensee over the term of the arrangement, as well as the amount of consideration that the Company is entitled to receive
in exchange for providing access to its trademarks. As of April 2, 2022, contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amounts expected to be recognized as
revenue during future periods were as follows:

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Net revenues from the Company's retail and wholesale businesses are recognized at a point in time. Net revenues from the Company's licensing
business are recognized over time.
Deferred Income
Deferred income represents cash payments received in advance of the Company's transfer of control of products or services to its customers and
generally consists of unredeemed gift cards (net of breakage) and advance royalty payments from licensees. The Company's deferred income balances were
$16.6 million and $12.1 million as of April 2, 2022 and March 27, 2021, respectively, and were primarily recorded within accrued expenses and other current
liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. The majority of the deferred income balance as of April 2, 2022 is expected to be recognized as revenue
within the next twelve months.
Cost of Goods Sold and Selling Expenses
Cost of goods sold includes the amounts incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale to the Company's customers, including product costs,
freight-in, and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability. Gains and losses associated with forward foreign
currency exchange contracts that are designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of inventory transactions are also recognized within cost of goods sold
when the hedged inventory is sold. The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated with preparing merchandise for sale, such as picking,
packing, warehousing, and order charges ("handling costs"), are included in selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Costs associated with shipping goods to customers are accounted for as fulfillment activities and reflected as SG&A expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations. Shipping and handling costs (described above) billed to customers are included in revenue. A summary of shipping and handling
costs recognized during the fiscal periods presented is as follows:

Advertising and Marketing Costs
Advertising costs, including the costs to produce advertising, are expensed when the advertisement is first exhibited. Advertising costs paid to
wholesale customers under cooperative advertising programs are not included in advertising costs, but rather are reflected as a reduction of revenue since
generally the benefits are not sufficiently separable from the purchases of the Company's products by customers. Costs associated with the marketing and
promotion of the Company's products are included within SG&A expenses.
Advertising and marketing expenses were $456.3 million, $265.0 million, and $278.0 million in Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020,
respectively. Deferred advertising, marketing, and promotional costs, which principally relate to advertisements that have not yet been exhibited or payments
made for services that have not yet been received, were $7.9 million and $9.5 million at the end of Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively, and were
recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
The financial position and operating results of the Company's foreign operations are accounted for in their respective functional currencies, which are
generally consistent with the local currency. For purposes of consolidation, local currency assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. Dollars at the spot rates
of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. Dollars at average rates of exchange in
effect during the period. The

resulting translation gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as a component of other comprehensive
income (loss) ("OCI") and in the consolidated statements of equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"). Gains and losses on the
translation of intercompany loans made to foreign subsidiaries that are of a long-term investment nature are also included within this component of equity.
The Company also recognizes gains and losses on both third-party and intercompany balances that are denominated in a currency other than the
respective entity's functional currency. Such foreign currency transactional gains and losses are recognized within other income (expense), net in the
consolidated statements of operations, inclusive of the effects of any related hedging activities, and reflected net gains of $2.8 million and $8.7 million in
Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively, and a net loss of $1.1 million in Fiscal 2020.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income (loss), which is reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated statements of equity,
consists of net income (loss) and certain other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from net income (loss) and referred to as
OCI. Components of OCI consist of foreign currency translation gains (losses); net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, such as
forward foreign currency exchange contracts; net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments; and net realized and unrealized
gains (losses) related to the Company's defined benefit plans.
Net Income (Loss) per Common Share
Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shares by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Weighted-average common shares include shares of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock.
Diluted net income (loss) per common share adjusts basic net income (loss) per common share for the dilutive effects of outstanding restricted stock units
("RSUs"), stock options, and any other potentially dilutive instruments, only for the periods in which such effects are dilutive.
The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic net income (loss) per common share is reconciled to shares used
to calculate diluted net income (loss) per common share as follows:

Incremental shares of 1.2 million attributable to outstanding RSUs were excluded from the computation of diluted shares for Fiscal 2021 as such
shares would not be dilutive given the net loss incurred during that fiscal year.
All earnings per share amounts have been calculated using unrounded numbers. The Company has outstanding performance-based RSUs, which are
included in the computation of diluted shares only to the extent that the underlying performance conditions (i) have been satisfied as of the end of the
reporting period or (ii) would be considered satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency period and the result would be
dilutive. In addition, options to purchase shares of the Company's Class A common stock at an exercise price greater than the average market price of such
common stock during the reporting period are anti-dilutive and therefore not included in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per common share. As
of the end of Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, there were 0.1 million, 0.4 million, and 0.8 million, respectively, of additional shares issuable
contingent upon vesting of performance-based RSUs and upon exercise of anti-dilutive stock options that were excluded from the diluted shares calculations.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date
fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures which are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and
expected future trends. The grant date fair values of service-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs are determined based on the fair value of the
Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do
not accrue while outstanding and unvested. The grant date fair value of the Company's market-based RSU awards, for which vesting is dependent upon total
shareholder return ("TSR") of its Class A common stock over a three-year performance period relative to that of a pre-established peer group, is estimated
using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the grant date fair value of any stock option
awards.
Compensation expense for all performance-based RSUs is recognized over the requisite service period when attainment of the performance goal is
deemed probable, net of estimated forfeitures. Compensation expense for market-based RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the requisite
service period regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied. The Company recognizes compensation expense on
an accelerated basis for all awards with graded vesting terms, including certain RSUs, restricted stock, and stock options. For RSU awards with cliff vesting
terms, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis. For certain RSU awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who will
become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, the related compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated
basis over a term commensurate with the period that the employee is required to provide service in order to vest in the award. See Note 18 for further
discussion of the Company's stock-based compensation plans.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less, including investments in time deposits and
debt securities. Investments in debt securities are diversified across high-credit quality issuers in accordance with the Company's risk-management policies.
Restricted Cash
The Company is periodically required to place cash in escrow with various banks as collateral, primarily to secure guarantees of corresponding
amounts made by the banks to international tax authorities on behalf of the Company, such as to secure refunds of value-added tax payments in certain
international tax jurisdictions or in the case of certain international tax audits, as well as to secure guarantees related to certain real estate leases. Such cash is
classified as restricted cash and reported as a component of either prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets in the consolidated
balance sheets.
Investments
The Company's investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit risk,
and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in the Company's investment policy.
Short-term investments consist of investments which the Company expects to convert into cash within one year, including any time deposits and debt
securities with original maturities greater than 90 days. See Note 13 for further information relating to the composition of the Company's short-term
investments.
The Company classifies such investments as available-for-sale. Accordingly, they are recorded at fair value with any related unrealized gains or losses
generally recognized as a component of AOCI in the consolidated balance sheets, and related realized gains or losses (or unrealized credit-related impairment
losses, if any) recorded within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. Cash inflows and outflows related to the sale and
purchase of investments are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Equity-method and Other Investments
Ownership interests that provide the Company with significant influence, but less than a controlling interest, over an investee are generally accounted
for using the equity method of accounting. Significant influence is generally presumed to exist when the Company owns between 20% and 50% of the
investee's common stock. Ownership interests that do not provide significant influence and for which the underlying equity security's fair value is not readily
determinable are generally recorded at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar
investments of the same investee, with such adjustments recognized within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations.
Under the equity method of accounting, the following amounts are generally recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements: the
Company's original investment, as subsequently adjusted for its share of the investee's earnings (losses) and reduced by any dividends received and other-
than-temporary impairments recorded, is included in the consolidated balance sheets; the Company's share of the investee's periodic earnings (losses) is
included in the consolidated statements of operations; and dividends and other cash distributions received from the investee and additional cash investments
made in or other cash paid to the investee are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company's share of equity-method investee earnings
and losses is recognized within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations and was not material in any of the fiscal years
presented.
These investments are recorded within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
Impairment Assessment
The Company evaluates the need to recognize impairment charges for its investments that are in unrealized loss positions, if any, and its other equity
investments on a quarterly basis (see Note 12). Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of the risks and uncertainties
associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers or investees. Factors considered by the Company include (i) the
financial condition, creditworthiness, and near-term prospects of the issuer or investee; (ii) future economic conditions and market forecasts; (iii) the length of
time to maturity, if applicable, and an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery
of market value; and (iv) whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the investment's carrying amount might not be recoverable.
During Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a $7.1 million impairment charge within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of
operations related to an equity method investment (see Note 8).
Accounts Receivable
In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to wholesale customers that satisfy certain defined credit criteria. Payment is generally
due within 30 to 120 days and does not involve a significant financing component. Accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates
fair value, and are presented in the consolidated balance sheets net of certain reserves and allowances. These reserves and allowances consist of (i) reserves
for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances (see the "Revenue Recognition"
section above for further discussion of related accounting policies) and (ii) allowances for doubtful accounts.

Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company sells its wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world,
and extends credit based on an evaluation of each customer's financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. In the Company's
wholesale business, concentration of credit risk is relatively limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas.
However, the Company has three key wholesale customers that generate significant sales volume. During Fiscal 2022, the Company's sales to its three largest
wholesale customers accounted for approximately 16% of total net revenues. Substantially all of the Company's sales to its three largest wholesale customers
related to its North America segment. As of April 2, 2022, these three key wholesale customers accounted for approximately 31% of total gross accounts
receivable.
Inventories
The Company holds inventory that is sold in its retail stores and digital commerce sites directly to consumers. The Company also holds inventory that
is to be sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners. Substantially all of the
Company's inventories consist of finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted-
average cost basis.
The estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of the Company's individual product lines, the
impact of market trends and economic conditions (such as those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events), and a forecast of future
demand, giving consideration to the value of current in-house orders for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell inventory through the Company's
factory stores, among other liquidation channels. Actual results may differ from estimates due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory,
consumer and retailer preferences, and actual economic and market conditions. In addition, reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical
loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. The Company's historical estimates of
the realizable value of its inventory and its reserves for inventory shrinkage have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse
future economic and market conditions could result in the Company's actual results differing materially from its estimates.

Implementation Costs Incurred in Cloud Computing Arrangements
For cloud computing arrangements that are a service contract, the Company capitalizes certain implementation costs incurred (depending on their
nature) during the application development stage of the related project, and expenses costs during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages as
they are incurred. Capitalized implementation costs are expensed on a straight-line basis over the reasonably certain term of the hosting arrangement,
beginning when the module is ready for its intended use. The Company's cloud computing arrangements relate to various areas, including certain retail store
and digital commerce operations, and corporate and administrative functions. Capitalized amounts related to such arrangements are recorded within prepaid
expenses and other current assets and within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 7). Capitalized implementation costs
expensed were $9.2 million, $8.4 million, and $4.3 million during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, respectively, and were recorded in SG&A
expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis, based upon the estimated
useful lives of depreciable assets, which range from three to seven years for furniture and fixtures, machinery and equipment, and capitalized software; and
from ten to forty years for buildings and improvements. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets or the term of the related lease.
Property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable (see Note 12). In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, including finite-lived
intangibles as described below, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from its use of the asset and its eventual disposition,
where applicable. If such estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is
recognized to the extent that such asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, as estimated considering external market participant assumptions and
discounted cash flows. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal (commonly referred to as assets held-for-sale) are
reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.
Leases
The Company's lease arrangements primarily relate to real estate, including its retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, corporate offices, and
warehouse facilities and, to a lesser extent, certain equipment and other assets. The Company's leases generally have initial terms ranging from three to fifteen
years and may include renewal or early-termination options, rent escalation clauses, and/or lease incentives in the form of construction allowances and rent
abatements. The Company is typically required to make fixed minimum rent payments, variable rent payments based on performance (e.g., percentage-of-
sales-based payments), or a combination thereof, relating to its right to use an underlying leased asset. The Company is also often required to pay for certain
other costs that do not relate specifically to its right to use an underlying leased asset, but that are associated with the asset, including real estate taxes,
insurance, common area maintenance fees, and/or certain other costs (referred to collectively herein as "non-lease components"), which may be fixed or
variable in amount, depending on the terms of the respective lease agreement. The Company's leases do not contain significantly restrictive covenants or
residual value guarantees.
The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at the arrangement's inception. If a lease is determined to exist, its related term is
assessed at the lease commencement date, once the underlying asset is made available by the lessor for the Company's use. The Company's assessment of the
lease term reflects the non-cancellable period of the lease, inclusive of any rent-free periods, plus any periods covered by early-termination options for which
the Company is not considered reasonably certain of exercising, as well as periods covered by renewal options for which it is considered reasonably certain of
exercising. The Company also determines lease classification as either operating or finance at lease commencement, which governs the pattern of expense
recognition and the presentation thereof in the consolidated statements of operations over the lease term.
For leases with a lease term exceeding 12 months, a liability is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at the lease commencement date reflecting
the present value of its related fixed payment obligations over such term. A corresponding right-of-use ("ROU") asset equal to the initial lease liability is also
recorded, increased by any prepaid rent and/or initial direct costs incurred in connection with execution of the lease, and reduced by any incentives provided
by the lessor. The Company also includes fixed payment obligations related to non-lease components in the measurement of its ROU assets and lease
liabilities,

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
given its election to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component. Variable lease payments are not included in the
measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets associated with finance leases are presented separately from those associated with operating
leases, and are included within property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheet. For purposes of measuring the present value of its fixed
payment obligations for a given lease, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, determined based on information available at lease commencement,
given that rates implicit in its leasing arrangements are not readily determinable. The Company's incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate it would pay to
borrow on a secured basis an amount equal to the lease payments and incorporates the term and economic environment of the lease.
For operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as operating lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the
initial ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term, along with recognition of interest expense associated with accretion of the
remaining lease liability, which is ultimately reduced by the related fixed payments as they are made. For leases with a lease term of 12 months or less
(referred to as a "short-term lease"), any fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over such term and are not recognized on the
consolidated balance sheet. For all leases, variable lease cost, if any, is recognized as incurred.
ROU assets, along with any related long-lived assets, are periodically evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their
carrying values may not be fully recoverable (see Note 12). To the extent that such assets are ultimately determined to be impaired, they are written down
accordingly on a relative carrying amount basis, with the ROU asset written down to an amount no lower than its estimated fair value. Subsequent to the
recognition of any such impairment, total remaining lease cost is recognized on a front-loaded basis over the remaining lease term.
See Note 14 for further discussion of the Company's leases.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
At acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which typically consist of reacquired license
agreements, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and/or order backlog. The fair values of these intangible assets are estimated based on
management's assessment, considering independent third-party appraisals when necessary. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net
assets acquired, both tangible and intangible, is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are
not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. The Company generally performs its
annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analyses using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that
the fair values of such assets are less than their respective carrying values. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is concluded that it is not
more likely than not that the fair value of the asset exceeds its carrying value, a quantitative test is performed. Under the quantitative test, if the carrying value
of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess. The Company also periodically performs a quantitative test to
assess its goodwill for impairment in lieu of using the qualitative approach in order to reassess the fair values of its reporting units.
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets as noted above, are
evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable.
See discussion of the Company's accounting policy for long-lived asset impairment as previously described under the caption "Property and Equipment, Net."
Income Taxes
Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current taxes
payable/refunds receivable, and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the results of any difference
between U.S. GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating losses, capital losses, general business credit
carryforwards, and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax
purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of
enactment.
F-17

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
In addition, valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax
asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur or circumstances change that warrant adjustments.
In determining the income tax benefit (provision) for financial reporting purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If the
Company considers that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, it recognizes
the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement,
presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be
complex and the Company often obtains assistance from external advisors. To the extent that the Company's estimates change or the final tax outcome of
these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax benefit (provision) in the period in which such
determinations are made. If the initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, the Company regularly monitors its position and
subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the
technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement
of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the Company expects to pay cash within the next
twelve months. Interest and penalties are recorded within the income tax benefit (provision) in the consolidated statements of operations and are classified on
the consolidated balance sheets together with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company accounts for the minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") in the period in which it is incurred.
See Note 10 for further discussion of the Company's income taxes.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company records derivative financial instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting are either (i) offset through earnings against the changes in fair value of the related hedged
assets, liabilities, or firm commitments or (ii) recognized in equity as a component of AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, depending on
whether the instrument is hedging against changes in fair value or cash flows and net investments, respectively.
Each derivative instrument that qualifies for hedge accounting is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the risk associated with the related
exposure. For each instrument that is designated as a hedge, the Company documents the related risk management objective and strategy, including
identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, and the risk exposure, as well as how hedge effectiveness will be assessed over the instrument's
term. To assess hedge effectiveness at the inception of a hedging relationship, the Company generally uses regression analysis, a statistical method, to
evaluate how changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are expected to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of the related hedged item.
The extent to which a hedging instrument has been and is expected to remain highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows is
assessed by the Company on at least a quarterly basis.
Given its use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual
obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, the Company's policy is to only enter into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based
upon an evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. The Company's established policies and
procedures for mitigating credit risk include ongoing review and assessment of its counterparties' creditworthiness. The Company also enters into master
netting arrangements with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. In the event of default or termination, these arrangements allow the
Company to net-settle amounts payable and receivable related to multiple derivative transactions with the same counterparty. The master netting
arrangements specify a number of events of default and termination, including the failure to make timely payments.
The fair values of the Company's derivative instruments are recorded on its consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. For cash flow reporting
purposes, proceeds received or amounts paid upon the settlement of a derivative instrument are classified in the same manner as the related item being
hedged, primarily within cash flows from operating activities for its forward foreign exchange contracts and within cash flows from investing activities for its
cross-currency swap contracts, both as discussed below.
F-18

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate its risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions
made in an entity's non-functional currency. To the extent designated as cash flow hedges, related gains or losses on such instruments are initially deferred in
equity as a component of AOCI and are subsequently recognized within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations when the related
inventory is sold.
If a derivative instrument is dedesignated or if hedge accounting is discontinued because the instrument is not expected to be highly effective in
hedging the designated exposure, any further gains (losses) are recognized in earnings each period within other income (expense), net. Upon discontinuance
of hedge accounting, the cumulative change in fair value of the derivative instrument recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the related hedged
item affects earnings, consistent with the hedging strategy, unless the related forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring, in which case the
accumulated amount is immediately recognized within other income (expense), net.
Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations
The Company periodically uses cross-currency swap contracts to reduce risk associated with exchange rate fluctuations on certain of its net
investments in foreign subsidiaries. Changes in the fair values of such derivative instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign
operations are recorded in equity as a component of AOCI in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. In assessing the effectiveness of
such hedges, the Company uses a method based on changes in spot rates to measure the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on both its
foreign subsidiary net investment and the related hedging instrument. Under this method, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument other than those
due to changes in the spot rate are initially recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are amortized into earnings as interest expense using a
systematic and rational method over the instrument's term. Changes in fair value associated with the effective portion (i.e., those due to changes in the spot
rate) are recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are released and recognized in earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the hedged net
investment.
Undesignated Hedges
The Company uses undesignated hedges primarily to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk related to third-party and intercompany balances and
exposures. Changes in the fair values of such instruments are recognized in earnings each period within other income (expense), net.
See Note 13 for further discussion of the Company's derivative financial instruments.
4.    Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Reference Rate Reform
In March 2020 and January 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2020-04,
"Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting" ("ASU 2020-04") and ASU No. 2021-01, "Reference Rate Reform: Scope"
("ASU 2021-01"), respectively. Together, ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions for the application of U.S.
GAAP, if certain criteria are met, to contract modifications, hedging relationships, and other arrangements that are expected to be impacted by the global
transition away from certain reference rates, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and other interbank offered rates, towards new reference
rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). The guidance in ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 was effective upon issuance and, once
adopted, may be applied prospectively to contract modifications and hedging relationships through December 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating the
impact that the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, if adopted, and currently does not expect that it would be
material.

9.    Restructuring and Other Charges, Net
A description of significant restructuring and other activities and their related costs is provided below.
Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan
The Company has undertaken efforts to realign its resources to support future growth and profitability, and to create a sustainable, enhanced cost
structure. The key areas of the Company's initiatives underlying these efforts involve evaluation of its: (i) team organizational structures and ways of working;
(ii) real estate footprint and related costs across its corporate offices, distribution centers, and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors; and (iii) brand
portfolio.
In connection with the first initiative, on September 17, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the "Fiscal 2021
Strategic Realignment Plan") to reduce its global workforce. Additionally, during a preliminary review of its store portfolio during the second quarter of
Fiscal 2021, the Company made the decision to close its Polo store on Regent Street in London.
Shortly thereafter, on October 29, 2020, the Company announced the planned transition of its Chaps brand to a fully licensed business model,
consistent with its long-term brand elevation strategy and in connection with its third initiative. Specifically, the Company entered into a multi-year licensing
partnership, which took effect on August 1, 2021 following a transition period, with an affiliate of 5 Star Apparel LLC, a division of the OVED Group, to
manufacture, market, and distribute Chaps menswear and womenswear. This agreement is expected to create incremental value for the Company by enabling
an even greater focus on elevating its core brands in the marketplace, reducing its direct exposure to the North America department store channel, and setting
up Chaps to deliver on its potential with an experienced partner that is focused on nurturing the brand.
Later, on February 3, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved additional actions related to its real estate initiative. Specifically, the Company
is in the process of further rightsizing and consolidating its global corporate offices to better align with its organizational profile and new ways of working.
The Company also has closed, and may continue to close, certain of its stores to improve overall profitability. Additionally, the Company further consolidated
its North America distribution centers in order to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability, and deliver a better consumer experience.
Finally, on June 26, 2021, in connection with its brand portfolio initiative, the Company sold its former Club Monaco business to Regent, L.P.
("Regent"), a global private equity firm, with no resulting gain or loss on sale realized during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. Regent acquired Club Monaco's
assets and liabilities in exchange for potential future cash consideration payable to the Company, including earn-out payments based on Club Monaco meeting
certain defined revenue thresholds over a five-year period. Accordingly, the Company may realize amounts in the future related to the receipt of such
contingent consideration (as discussed further below). Additionally, in connection with this divestiture, the Company is providing Regent with certain
operational support for a transitional period of approximately one year, varying by functional area.

Actions associated with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan were substantially completed by the end Fiscal 2022, with certain remaining
actions expected to be completed during Fiscal 2023. The Company now expects total charges of up to $300 million to be incurred in connection with this
plan, consisting of cash-related charges of approximately $180 million and non-cash charges of approximately $120 million. A summary of the charges
recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan during the fiscal periods presented (inclusive of immaterial other restructuring-related

In addition to the charges summarized in the table above, the Company recognized $4.0 million of income within restructuring and other charges, net
in the consolidated statements of operations during Fiscal 2022 primarily related to a certain revenue share clause in its agreement with Regent that entitled it
to receive a portion of the sales generated by the Club Monaco business during a four-month business transition period. The Company donated this income to
the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, a non-profit, charitable foundation, which resulted in a related offsetting $4.0 million donation expense recorded
within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations during Fiscal 2022.

expired.
Additionally, during Fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a charge of $6.4 million in connection with non-income-related capital taxes resulting from
Swiss tax reform (see Note 10). During Fiscal 2020, the Company also recorded other charges of $20.8 million related to the donation of net cash proceeds
received from the sale of its corporate jet, which was paid to the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation.
10.    Income Taxes
Swiss Tax Reform
In May 2019, a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (the "Swiss Tax Act"),
which became effective January 1, 2020. The Swiss Tax Act eliminates certain preferential tax items at both the federal and cantonal levels for multinational
companies, and provides the cantons with parameters for establishing local tax rates and regulations. The Swiss Tax Act also provides transitional provisions,
one of which allows eligible companies to increase the tax basis of certain assets based on the value generated by their business in previous years, and to
amortize such adjustment as a tax deduction over a transitional period.
During the second quarter of Fiscal 2020, the Swiss Tax Act was enacted into law, resulting in an immaterial adjustment associated with the
revaluation of the Company's Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities and the then estimated annual effective tax rate. Subsequently, as a result of additional
information received from tax authorities and analyses performed related to the transitional provision noted above, the Company recorded a one-time income
tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset of $122.9 million during Fiscal 2020, which reduced the Company's effective tax rate by 3,760 basis points.
During Fiscal 2021, the Company reduced its one-time tax benefit by $13.8 million due to new legislation enacted in connection with the European
Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, which increased the Company's effective tax rate by 1,840 basis points.
Additionally, during Fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a charge of $6.4 million within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated
statements of operations in connection with non-income-related capital taxes resulting from Swiss Tax Reform.

Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the income tax benefit (provision) by income (loss) before income taxes.
The Company's Fiscal 2022 effective tax rate was slightly lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% primarily due to favorable tax
impacts of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and deferred tax adjustments, partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of additional income tax
reserves associated with certain income tax audits and tax impacts of compensation related adjustments. The Company's Fiscal 2021 effective tax rate was
unfavorable to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% primarily due to incremental tax expense resulting from new legislation enacted in
connection with the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, valuation allowances recorded against certain deferred tax assets as a result of significant
business disruptions attributable to COVID-19, and tax impacts on stock-based compensation and other permanent adjustments, partially offset by an income
tax benefit related to charitable contributions. The Company's Fiscal 2020 effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21%
primarily due to the one-time income tax benefit recorded in connection with the Swiss Tax Act, as previously discussed, the favorable impact of the change
in geographic mix of its worldwide earnings and the favorable impact of tax benefits associated with provision to tax return adjustments, partially offset by
the unfavorable impact of additional income tax reserves associated with certain income tax audits.

Net deferred tax balances as of April 2, 2022 and March 27, 2021 were comprised of non-current deferred tax assets of $303.8 million and $283.9
million, respectively, recorded within deferred tax assets, and non-current deferred tax liabilities of $12.5 million and $10.7 million, respectively,
recorded within other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company has available federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $16.9 million, $5.8 million, and $3.8 million (all net of tax),
respectively, for tax purposes to offset future taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in Fiscal 2023.
The Company also has available state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $4.7 million and $27.6 million (both net of tax), respectively, for
which no net deferred tax asset has been recognized. A full valuation allowance has been recorded against these carryforwards since the Company does not
believe that it will more likely than not be able to utilize these carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Subsequent recognition of these deferred tax
assets would result in an income tax benefit in the year of such recognition. The valuation allowance relating to state net operating loss carryforwards
decreased by $3.8 million (net of tax) as a result of changes in jurisdictions where the Company does not believe that it will more likely than not be able to
utilize these carryforwards in the future. The valuation allowance relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards increased by $0.2 million, mainly due to
differences in foreign exchange rates.

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
In January 2018, new U.S. tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") became effective. The TCJA significantly
revised U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, creating a territorial tax system that included a one-time mandatory transition tax on previously deferred
foreign earnings. As a result of the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the TCJA, the Company reevaluated its permanent
reinvestment assertion and determined that undistributed foreign earnings that were subject to the TCJA's one-time mandatory transition tax were no longer
considered to be permanently reinvested, effective December 31, 2017. The mandatory transition tax does not apply to undistributed foreign earnings
generated after December 31, 2017. Accordingly, provision has not been made for U.S.  or additional foreign taxes on approximately $1.884 billion of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries generated after December 31, 2017, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested. These earnings
could become subject to tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings were lent to RLC, a subsidiary or a U.S. affiliate of RLC, or if the stock of
the subsidiaries were sold. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.

Future Changes in Unrecognized Tax Benefits
The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the Company's tax positions is subject to change based on future events including, but not
limited to, settlements of ongoing tax audits and assessments and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Although the outcomes and timing of
such events are highly uncertain, the Company does not anticipate that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, will
change significantly during the next twelve months. However, changes in the occurrence, expected outcomes, and timing of such events could cause the
Company's current estimate to change materially in the future.
The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as tax returns in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company
is generally no longer subject to examinations by the relevant tax authorities for years prior to its fiscal year ended March 30, 2013.

Senior Notes
In August 2018, the Company completed a registered public debt offering and issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior
notes due September 15, 2025, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.750%, payable semi-annually (the "3.750% Senior Notes"). The 3.750% Senior Notes
were issued at a price equal to 99.521% of their principal amount. The proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate purposes, including
repayment of the Company's previously outstanding $300 million principal amount of 2.125% unsecured senior notes that matured September 26, 2018 (the
"2.125% Senior Notes").
In June 2020, the Company completed another registered public debt offering and issued an additional $500 million aggregate principal amount of
unsecured senior notes due June 15, 2022, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.700%, payable semi-annually (the "1.700% Senior Notes"), and $750
million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due June 15, 2030, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.950%, payable semi-annually (the
"2.950% Senior Notes"). The 1.700% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes were issued at prices equal to 99.880% and 98.995% of their principal amounts,
respectively. The proceeds from these offerings are being used for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment of $475 million previously
outstanding under the Company's Global Credit Facility (as defined below) on June 3, 2020 and repayment of its previously outstanding $300 million
principal amount of 2.625% unsecured senior notes that matured August 18, 2020 (the "2.625% Senior Notes").

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
The Company has the option to redeem the 3.750% Senior Notes, 1.700% Senior Notes, and 2.950% Senior Notes (collectively, the "Senior Notes"), in
whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the
series of Senior Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present value of Remaining Scheduled Payments, as defined in the supplemental indentures
governing such Senior Notes (together with the indenture governing the Senior Notes, the "Indenture"). The Indenture contains certain covenants that restrict
the Company's ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge with another
party; or sell, lease, or convey all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does not contain any
financial covenants.
Commercial Paper
The Company has a commercial paper borrowing program that allows it to issue up to $500 million of unsecured commercial paper notes through
private placement using third-party broker-dealers (the "Commercial Paper Program").
Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Global Credit Facility (as defined below). Accordingly, the Company does not
expect combined borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and Global Credit Facility to exceed $500 million. Commercial Paper
Program borrowings may be used to support the Company's general working capital and corporate needs. Maturities of commercial paper notes vary, but
cannot exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. Commercial paper notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program rank equally in seniority with the
Company's other forms of unsecured indebtedness. As of both April  2, 2022 and March  27, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the
Commercial Paper Program.
Revolving Credit Facilities
Global Credit Facility
In August 2019, the Company replaced its then existing credit facility and entered into a new credit facility that provides for a $500 million senior
unsecured revolving line of credit through August 12, 2024 (the "Global Credit Facility") under terms and conditions substantially similar to those of the
previous facility. The Global Credit Facility is also used to support the issuance of letters of credit and maintenance of the Commercial Paper Program.
Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and certain other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and
Japanese Yen, and are guaranteed by all of the Company's domestic significant subsidiaries. In accordance with the terms of the agreement governing the
Global Credit Facility, the Company has the ability to expand its borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $1 billion, subject to the agreement
of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout
the term of the Global Credit Facility.
Under the Global Credit Facility as originally implemented, U.S. Dollar-denominated borrowings bore interest, at the Company's option, either at (a) a
base rate, by reference to the greatest of: (i) the annual prime commercial lending rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time to time, (ii) the
weighted-average overnight Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 100 basis points; or (b) LIBOR, adjusted for the Federal
Reserve Board's Eurocurrency liabilities maximum reserve percentage, plus a spread of 75 basis points, subject to adjustment based on the Company's credit
ratings ("Adjusted LIBOR"). Foreign currency-denominated borrowings bore interest at Adjusted LIBOR. In addition to paying interest on any outstanding
borrowings under the Global Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Global Credit Facility relating to the
unutilized commitments. The current commitment fee rate of 9 basis points is subject to adjustment based on the Company's credit ratings. Certain of these
provisions were amended in January 2022 and March 2022, as discussed further below.
The Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company's ability, subject to specified exceptions, to
incur additional debt; incur liens; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are
not in a related line of business; make loans, advances, or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make certain investments. As originally
implemented, the Global Credit Facility also requires the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR (the "leverage
ratio") of no greater than 4.25 as of the date of measurement for the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Adjusted Debt is defined generally as
consolidated debt outstanding, including finance lease obligations, plus all operating lease obligations. Consolidated EBITDAR is defined generally as
consolidated net income plus (i)  income tax expense, (ii)  net interest expense, (iii)  depreciation and amortization expense, (iv)  operating lease cost, (v)
restructuring and other non-recurring expenses, and (vi) acquisition-related costs. Certain of these requirements were temporarily amended in May 2020, as
discussed below.

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company entered into an amendment of its Global Credit Facility in May 2020 (the "Amendment"), which
among its various provisions (as described in Note 11 of the Fiscal 2021 10-K), temporarily waived its leverage ratio requirement and imposed certain
restrictions, including but not limited to, the amount of dividends and distributions on, or purchases, redemptions, repurchases, retirements or acquisitions of,
the Company's stock. Subsequently, in November 2021, all terms and conditions reverted back to the original credit facility agreement upon the Company
satisfying certain requirements stipulated in the Amendment.
In 2020 and 2021, it was publicly announced that LIBOR rates would cease to be published for U.S. Dollars on June 30, 2023 and for Euros, Japanese
Yen, and certain other currencies on December 31, 2021. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies jointly recommended that banks cease entering into new
contracts using LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable but by no later than December 31, 2021, and that new contracts entered into prior to
December 31, 2021 should either use a reference rate other than LIBOR or include effective fallback language with a clearly-defined alternative reference rate
effective upon the discontinuation of LIBOR. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which is a group of private-market participants convened by the
Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help ensure a successful transition from LIBOR, recommended the Secured Overnight
Financing Rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("SOFR") as the alternative to LIBOR.
As a result of the cessation of LIBOR, in January 2022 the Company entered into a second amendment of its Global Credit Facility (the "Second
Amendment"). Under the Second Amendment, alternate rates of interest were provided for specific Eurocurrency borrowings. Eurocurrency borrowings
denominated in Euros now bear interest based on the Adjusted Euro Interbank Offered Rate, those denominated in Japanese Yen now bear interest based on
the Adjusted Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate and those denominated in Hong Kong Dollars now bear interest based on the Adjusted Hong Kong Dollar
Interbank Offered Rate, as each such term is defined in the Global Credit Facility as amended by the Second Amendment.
In March 2022, the Company entered into a third amendment of its Global Credit Facility (the "Third Amendment"). Under the Third Amendment, an
alternative rate of interest to the LIBOR rate was established for U.S. Dollar-denominated borrowings. U.S. Dollar-denominated borrowings now bear interest
based on, at the Company's option, either (a) a base rate, determined by reference to the greatest of: (i) the prime commercial lending rate as quoted in the
Wall Street Journal in effect from time to time; (ii) the greater of the rate comprised of both overnight federal funds and overnight eurodollar transactions or
the rate calculated based on federal funds transactions by depositary institutions, in either case determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 50
basis points; or (iii) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, as such term is defined in the Global Credit Facility as amended by the Third Amendment, for one-month
plus 100 basis points, (b) the Term SOFR Rate, as such term is defined in the Global Credit Facility as amended by the Third Amendment, plus 10 basis
points or (c) a rate equal to the Daily Simple SOFR Rate, as such term is defined in the Global Credit Facility, as amended by the Third Amendment, plus 10
basis points. The Third Amendment also added provisions to the Global Credit Facility to address possible future situations in which a reference rate for
determining a relevant interest rate under the Global Credit Facility is no longer available or representative.
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Global Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Global Credit Facility,
and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Global Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (many of which
are subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure to make timely principal, interest, and fee payments or to satisfy the covenants,
including the financial covenant described above. Additionally, the Global Credit Facility provides that an Event of Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren,
the Company's Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage
of the voting power of the Company's common stock. As of April 2, 2022, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility)
has occurred under the Company's Global Credit Facility.
In March 2020, the Company borrowed $475.0 million under the Global Credit Facility as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen its
liquidity position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was subsequently repaid in June 2020. As of both April 2, 2022 and March 27, 2021, there
were no borrowings outstanding under the Global Credit Facility. However, the Company was contingently liable for $9.5 million and $8.9 million of
outstanding letters of credit.

Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities
Certain of the Company's subsidiaries in Asia have uncommitted credit facilities with regional branches of JPMorgan Chase in China and South Korea
(the "Pan-Asia Credit Facilities"). Additionally, the Company's Japan subsidiary has an uncommitted overdraft facility with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corporation (the "Japan Overdraft Facility"). The Pan-Asia Credit Facilities and Japan Overdraft Facility (collectively, the "Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities")
are subject to annual renewal and may be used to fund general working capital needs of the Company's operations in the respective countries. Borrowings
under the Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities are guaranteed by the parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the respective banks, subject to
availability of the banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. The Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities do not contain any financial covenants.
A summary of the Company's Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities by country is as follows:
•
China Credit Facility — provides Ralph Lauren Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. with a revolving line of credit of up to 50 million Chinese
Renminbi (approximately $8 million) through April 3, 2023, which is also able to be used to support bank guarantees. The Company amended
the China Credit Facility during the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, whereby the borrowing capacity was increased up to 100 million Chinese
Renminbi (approximately $16 million).
•
South Korea Credit Facility — provides Ralph Lauren (Korea) Ltd. with a revolving line of credit of up to 30 billion South Korean Won
(approximately $25 million) through October 28, 2022.
•
Japan Overdraft Facility — provides Ralph Lauren Corporation Japan with an overdraft amount of up to 5 billion Japanese Yen (approximately
$41 million) through April 28, 2023.
As of both April 2, 2022 and March 27, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities.
12.    Fair Value Measurements
U.S. GAAP prescribes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The determination of the applicable level within the
hierarchy for a particular asset or liability depends on the inputs used in its valuation as of the measurement date, notably the extent to which the inputs are
market-based (observable) or internally-derived (unobservable). A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:
•
Level 1 — inputs to the valuation methodology based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•
Level 2 — inputs to the valuation methodology based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets for substantially the full
term of the financial instrument; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active for substantially the full term of
the financial instrument; and model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are observable.
•
Level  3  — inputs to the valuation methodology based on unobservable prices or valuation techniques that are significant to the fair value
measurement.
The following table summarizes the Company's financial assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis,

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
The Company's derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets and are valued using pricing models that
are primarily based on market observable external inputs, including spot and forward currency exchange rates, benchmark interest rates, and discount rates
consistent with the instrument's tenor, and consider the impact of the Company's own credit risk, if any. Changes in counterparty credit risk are also
considered in the valuation of derivative financial instruments.
To the extent the Company invests in commercial paper, such investments are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in its
consolidated balance sheets using external pricing data, based on interest rates and credit ratings for similar issuances with the same remaining term as the
Company's investments. To the extent the Company invests in bonds, such investments are also classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in its
consolidated balance sheets based on quoted prices in active markets.
The Company's cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and time deposits are recorded at carrying value, which generally approximates fair value
based on Level 1 measurements.
The Company's debt instruments are recorded at their amortized cost in its consolidated balance sheets, which may differ from their respective fair
values. The fair values of the Senior Notes are estimated based on external pricing data, including available quoted market prices, and with reference to
comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates, credit ratings, and trading frequency, among other factors. The fair values of the Company's
commercial paper notes and borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities, if any, are estimated using external pricing data, based on interest rates and
credit ratings for similar issuances with the same remaining term as the Company's outstanding borrowings. Due to their short-term nature, the fair values of
the Company's commercial paper notes and borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities, if any, generally approximate their amortized cost carrying
values.
The following table summarizes the carrying values and the estimated fair values of the Company's debt instruments:

Based on Level 2 measurements.
Unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the Company's debt instruments do not result in the realization or expenditure of
cash unless the debt is retired prior to its maturity.
Non-financial Assets and Liabilities
The Company's non-financial assets, which primarily consist of goodwill, other intangible assets, property and equipment, and lease-related ROU
assets, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and instead are reported at their amortized or depreciated cost in its consolidated
balance sheet. However, on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be fully recoverable (and at least
annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets), the respective carrying value of non-financial assets are assessed for impairment and, if
ultimately considered impaired, are adjusted and written down to their fair value, as estimated based on consideration of external market participant
assumptions and discounted cash flows.
During Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of certain long-
lived assets to their estimated fair values. The fair values of these assets were determined based on Level 3 measurements, the related inputs of which
included estimates of the amount and timing of the assets' net future discounted cash flows (including any potential sublease income for lease-related ROU
assets), based on historical experience and consideration of current trends, market conditions, and comparable sales, as applicable.

Impairment of equity method investment is recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. All other
impairment charges are recorded within impairments of assets in the consolidated statements of operations, unless otherwise noted.
Total impairment charges for Fiscal 2020 includes $225.1 million recorded in connection with the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2016-02,
"Leases" as of the beginning of Fiscal 2020 which, net of related income tax benefits, reduced its opening retained earnings balance by $169.4
million.
See Note 8 for additional discussion regarding non-cash impairment charges recorded by the Company within the consolidated statements of
operations during the fiscal years presented.
No impairment charges associated with goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded during any of the fiscal years presented. In Fiscal 2022, the
Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative approach as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2022. In
performing the assessment, the Company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affected the fair
values and/or carrying amounts of its reporting units with allocated goodwill. These factors included external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and
market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as the Company's actual and expected financial performance. Additionally, the Company also
considered the results of its most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test, which was performed as of the end of Fiscal 2020 and incorporated
assumptions related to COVID-19 business disruptions, the results of which indicated that the fair values of these reporting units significantly exceeded their
respective carrying values. Based on the results of its qualitative goodwill impairment assessment, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not
that the fair values of its reporting units are less than their respective carrying values and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment.

13.    Financial Instruments
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily relating to certain anticipated cash flows and the value of the
reported net assets of its international operations, as well as changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate debt obligations attributed to changes in benchmark
interest rates. Accordingly, based on its assessment thereof, the Company may use derivative financial instruments to manage and mitigate such risks. The
Company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

Risk Management Strategies
Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts
The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate its risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions
made in an entity's non-functional currency, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net
assets into U.S. dollars. As part of its overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the
Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi, the
Company generally hedges a portion of its related exposures anticipated over the next twelve months using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with
maturities of two months to one year to provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure.
Cross-Currency Swap Contracts
The Company periodically designates pay-fixed rate, receive fixed-rate cross-currency swap contracts as hedges of its net investment in certain of its
European subsidiaries.
The Company's pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contracts swap U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed interest rate payments based on
the contract's notional amount and the fixed rate of interest payable on certain of the Company's senior notes for Euro-denominated fixed interest rate
payments, thereby economically converting a portion of its fixed-rate U.S. Dollar-denominated senior note obligations to fixed-rate Euro-denominated
obligations.
See Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's accounting policies relating to its derivative financial instruments.
Investments
The Company's short-term investments as of April 2, 2022 and March 27, 2021, were $734.6 million and $197.5 million, respectively, and consisted of
time deposits.
No significant realized or unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments or impairment charges were recorded during any of the fiscal
years presented.
Refer to Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's accounting policies relating to its investments.

Employee Agreements
The Company has employment agreements with certain executives in the normal course of business which provide for compensation and certain other
benefits. These agreements also provide for severance payments under certain circumstances.
Other Commitments
Other off-balance sheet firm commitments amounted to $1.339 billion as of April  2, 2022, including inventory purchase commitments of $916.0
million, lease commitments related to lease agreements for which the related lease terms have not yet commenced of $23.9 million, outstanding letters of
credit of $9.5 million, interest payments related to the Company's debt of $244.9 million, and other commitments of $144.9 million, comprised of the
Company's legally-binding obligations under sponsorship, licensing, and other marketing and advertising agreements, information technology-related service
agreements, and pension-related obligations.
Other Matters
The Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation, other legal claims, and proceedings involving matters associated with or incidental to its
business, including, among other things, matters involving credit card fraud, trademark and other intellectual property, licensing, importation and exportation
of its products, taxation, unclaimed property, leases, and employee relations. The Company believes at present that the resolution of currently pending matters
will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements. However, the Company's assessment of any
current litigation or other legal claims could potentially change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known or determinations by judges, juries, or
other finders of fact which are not in accord with management's evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or claims.
In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into certain guarantees or other agreements that provide general indemnifications. The
Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements in the past and does not currently anticipate incurring any material
indemnification payments.

16.    Equity
Capital Stock
The Company's capital stock consists of two classes of common stock. There are 500 million shares of Class A common stock and 100 million shares
of Class B common stock authorized to be issued. Shares of Class A and Class B common stock have substantially identical rights, except with respect to
voting rights. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share.
Holders of both classes of stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to the stockholders for their approval, except with respect to the
election and removal of directors or as otherwise required by applicable law. All outstanding shares of Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph
Lauren, the Company's Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family, and are convertible at any time into
shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.
Class B Common Stock Conversions
During Fiscal 2020, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., a limited liability company managed by the children of Mr. Ralph Lauren, converted 1.0 million shares
of Class B common stock into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the security. These conversions occurred in
advance of a sales plan providing for the sale of such shares of Class A common stock pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 subject to the conditions set forth therein.
These transactions resulted in a reclassification within equity and had no effect on the consolidated balance sheet.
Common Stock Repurchase Program
Repurchases of shares of the Company's Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions, as well as other potential factors
such as the temporary restrictions previously in place under the Company's Global Credit Facility. Accordingly, in response to business disruptions related to
the COVID-19 pandemic, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, the Company temporarily suspended its common stock repurchase program
as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen its liquidity position. However, the Company resumed activities under its Class A common stock
repurchase program during the third quarter of Fiscal 2022 as restrictions under its Global Credit Facility were lifted (see Note 11) and overall business and
market conditions have improved since the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged.
A summary of the Company's repurchases of Class A common stock under its common stock repurchase program is as follows:

On February 2, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved an expansion of the Company's existing common stock repurchase program that
allows it to repurchase up to an additional $1.500 billion of its Class A common stock. As of April 2, 2022, the remaining availability under the Company's
Class A common stock repurchase program was approximately $1.629 billion.
In addition, during Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, 0.4 million, 0.5 million, and 0.4 million shares of Class A common stock, respectively, at
a cost of $42.1 million, $37.7 million, and $44.5 million, respectively, were surrendered to or withheld by the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in
connection with the vesting of awards under the Company's long-term stock incentive plans.
Repurchased and surrendered shares are accounted for as treasury stock at cost and held in treasury for future use.

Dividends
Except as discussed below, the Company has maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on its common stock since 2003.
In response to business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 the Company temporarily
suspended its quarterly cash dividend program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen its liquidity position. On May 19, 2021, the Company's
Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of its quarterly cash dividend program at the pre-pandemic amount of $0.6875 per share. Dividends paid
amounted to $150.0 million, $49.8 million, and $203.9 million for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, respectively.
On May 18, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase to the Company's quarterly cash dividend on its common stock from
$0.6875 to $0.75 per share. The first quarterly dividend declared to reflect this increase will be payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on
July 1, 2022 and will be paid on July 15, 2022.
The Company intends to continue to pay regular dividends on outstanding shares of its common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay
dividends in the future will ultimately be made at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend on the Company's results of operations,
cash requirements, financial condition, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, including economic and market conditions.

Long-term Stock Incentive Plans
On August 1, 2019, the Company's shareholders approved the 2019 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "2019 Incentive Plan"), which replaced the
Company's Amended and Restated 2010 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "2010 Incentive Plan"). The 2019 Incentive Plan provided for 1.2 million of
new shares authorized for issuance to the participants, in addition to the approximately 3.0 million shares that remained available for issuance under the 2010
Incentive Plan as of August 1, 2019. In addition, any outstanding awards under the 2010 Incentive Plan or the Company's 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive
Plan (the "1997 Incentive Plan") that expire, are forfeited, or are surrendered to the Company in satisfaction of taxes, will become available for issuance under
the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan became effective August 1, 2019 and no further grants will be made under the 2010 Incentive Plan.
Outstanding awards issued prior to August 1, 2019 will continue to remain subject to the terms of the 2010 Incentive Plan or 1997 Incentive Plan, as
applicable. As of April 2, 2022, 3.2 million shares remained available for future issuance under the Company's incentive plans.
Stock-based compensation awards that may be made under the 2019 Incentive Plan include, but are not limited to, (i) RSUs, (ii) restricted stock, and
(iii) stock options. During the fiscal periods presented, annual grants consisted entirely of RSUs. For RSUs granted to retirement-eligible employees, or
employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, vesting continues post-retirement for all or a
portion of the remaining unvested RSUs.

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2020 include $2.0 million and $3.6 million, respectively, of accelerated stock-based compensation expense recorded within
restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations (see Note 9). All other stock-based compensation expense was
recorded within SG&A expenses.
The Company issues its annual grants of stock-based compensation awards in the first half of each fiscal year. Due to the timing of the annual grants
and other factors, including the timing and magnitude of forfeiture and performance goal achievement adjustments, as well as changes to the size and
composition of the eligible employee population, stock-based compensation expense recognized during any given fiscal period is not indicative of the level of
compensation expense expected to be incurred in future periods.
Service-based RSUs
Service-based RSUs granted to certain of the Company's senior executives and other employees, as well as non-employee directors, generally vest over
a three-year period, subject to the employee's continuing employment (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become
retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed). The fair values of service-based RSUs are based
on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend
equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested.

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Performance-based RSUs
The Company grants performance-based RSUs to its senior executives and other key employees. The fair values of performance-based RSUs are based
on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend
equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested. Performance-based RSUs generally vest (i) upon the completion of a three-year period of
time (cliff vesting), subject to the employee's continuing employment (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become
retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed) and the Company's achievement of certain
performance goals established at the beginning of the three-year performance period or (ii) ratably, over a three-year period of time (graded vesting), subject
to the employee's continuing employment during the applicable vesting period (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who
become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed) and the achievement by the Company of
certain performance goals in the initial year of the three-year vesting period.
For performance-based RSUs subject to cliff vesting, the number of shares that may be earned ranges between 0% (if the specified threshold
performance level is not attained) and 200% (if performance meets or exceeds the maximum achievement level) of the awards originally granted. If actual
performance exceeds the pre-established threshold, the number of shares earned is calculated based on the relative performance between specified levels of
achievement.
No performance-based awards were granted during Fiscal 2021 as the Company elected to temporarily issue service-based RSUs in lieu of
performance-based RSUs as a result of business disruptions and uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, performance metrics of certain
cliff-vesting performance-based RSUs granted during prior years were changed during Fiscal 2021 and their related payout ranges lowered, with no resulting
incremental compensation cost.
Market-based RSUs
The Company grants cliff vesting RSU awards to its senior executives and other key employees, which, in addition to being subject to continuing
employment requirements (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the
awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed), are also subject to a market condition based on a TSR performance metric. The number of
shares that vest upon the completion of a three-year period of time is determined by comparing the Company's TSR relative to that of a pre-established peer
group over the related three-year performance period. Depending on the Company's level of achievement against its TSR performance goals, the number of
shares that ultimately vest may range from 0% to 200% of the awards originally granted.
The Company estimates the fair value of its TSR awards on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation, which models multiple stock price paths
of the Company's Class A common stock and that of its peer group to evaluate and determine its ultimate expected relative TSR performance
ranking. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately
satisfied. No such awards were granted during Fiscal 2021 as the Company elected to temporarily issue service-based RSUs in lieu of performance-based
RSUs as a result of business disruptions and uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of TSR awards granted were as follows:

Aggregate intrinsic value is the amount by which the market price of the Company's Class A common stock at the end of the period exceeds the
exercise price of the stock option, multiplied by the number of options.
There were no nonvested stock options as of April 2, 2022. Accordingly, there was no related unrecognized compensation expense as of April 2,

19.    Employee Benefit Plans
Defined Contribution Plans
The Company sponsors defined contribution benefit plans covering substantially all eligible employees in the U.S.  and Puerto Rico who are not
covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The plans include a savings plan feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company
makes matching contributions to the plans equal to 50% of the first 6% of salary contributed by an eligible employee. Additionally, the Company makes a
supplemental matching contribution for plan years in which the Company achieves an "above target" performance level based on certain goals established at
the beginning of each fiscal year, increasing the matching contribution to between 67% and 100% depending on the performance level achieved, of the first
6% of salary contributed by eligible employees, not to exceed the maximum contribution permitted by the plan.
Under the terms of the plans, a participant becomes 100% vested in the Company's matching contributions after five years of credited service.
Contributions made by the Company under these plans were $12.9 million, $9.8 million, and $8.7 million in Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020,
respectively.
International Defined Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors certain single-employer defined benefit plans and cash balance plans at international locations which are not considered to be
material individually or in the aggregate to the Company's financial statements. Pension benefits under these plans are based on formulas that reflect the
employees' years of service and compensation levels during their employment period. The aggregate funded status of the single-employer defined benefit
plans reflected net assets of $2.5 million and $0.7 million as of April 2, 2022 and March 27, 2021, respectively, and were primarily recorded within other non-
current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. These single-employer defined benefit plans had aggregate fair values of plan assets of $48.6 million and
aggregate projected benefit obligations of $46.1 million as of April 2, 2022, compared to aggregate fair values of plan assets of $56.8 million and aggregate
projected benefit obligations of $56.1 million as of March 27, 2021. The asset portfolio of the single-employer defined benefit plans primarily consists of
fixed income securities, which have been measured at fair value largely using Level 2 inputs, as described in Note 12. Net pension expense for these plans
was $4.6 million, $5.1 million, and $5.0 million in Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, respectively. The service cost component of $4.8 million, $5.9
million, and $4.7 million in Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, respectively, was recorded within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations. All other components of net pension expense during the fiscal years presented were recorded within other income (expense), net, in the
consolidated statement of operations.
Union Pension Plan
The Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan and is required to make contributions to the Workers United union (which was previously
known as UNITE HERE) (the "Union") for dues based on wages paid to union employees. A portion of these dues is allocated by the Union to a retirement
fund which provides defined benefits to substantially all unionized workers. The Company does not participate in the management of the plan and has not
been furnished with information with respect to the type of benefits provided, vested and non-vested benefits, or assets.
Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, an employer, upon withdrawal from or termination of a multi-employer
plan, is required to continue funding its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits. Such liability was assumed in conjunction with the
acquisition of certain assets from a non-affiliated licensee. The Company has no current intention of withdrawing from the plan.

20.    Segment Information
The Company has three reportable segments based on its business activities and organization:
•
North America — The North America segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home
furnishings, and related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S. and Canada. In North America, the
Company's retail business is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its factory stores, and its digital commerce site,
www.RalphLauren.com. The Company's wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department stores and, to a
lesser extent, specialty stores.
•
Europe — The Europe segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and
related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in Europe and emerging markets. In Europe, the Company's retail
business is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its factory stores, its concession-based shop-within-shops, and its various digital
commerce sites. The Company's wholesale business in Europe is comprised primarily of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and
specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital partners.
•
Asia — The Asia segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and related
products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. The Company's retail business in
Asia is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its factory stores, its concession-based shop-within-shops, and its various digital
commerce sites. In addition, the Company sells its products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. The Company's
wholesale business in Asia is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, with related products distributed through shop-within-shops.
No operating segments were aggregated to form the Company's reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company also has
other non-reportable segments, which primarily consist of Ralph Lauren and Chaps branded royalty revenues earned through its global licensing alliances. In
addition, prior to its disposition at the end of the Company's first quarter of Fiscal 2022, other non-reportable segments also included sales of Club Monaco
branded products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and its licensing alliances in Asia. Refer to
Note 9 for additional discussion regarding the disposition of the Company's former Club Monaco business, as well as the recent transition of its Chaps
business to a fully licensed business model.
The Company's segment reporting structure is consistent with how it establishes its overall business strategy, allocates resources, and assesses
performance of its business. The accounting policies of the Company's segments are consistent with those described in Notes 2 and 3. Sales and transfers
between segments are generally recorded at cost and treated as transfers of inventory. All intercompany revenues are eliminated in consolidation and are not
reviewed when evaluating segment performance. Each segment's performance is evaluated based upon net revenues and operating income before
restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other one-time items, if any. Certain corporate overhead expenses related to global functions,
most notably the Company's executive office, information technology, finance and accounting, human resources, and legal departments, largely remain at
corporate. Additionally, other costs that cannot be allocated to the segments based on specific usage are also maintained at corporate, including corporate
advertising and marketing expenses, depreciation and amortization of corporate assets, and other general and administrative expenses resulting from
corporate-level activities and projects. Asset information by segment is not utilized for purposes of assessing performance or allocating resources, and
therefore such information has not been presented.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ralph Lauren Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ralph Lauren Corporation (the "Company") as of April 2, 2022 and March 27, 2021,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
April 2, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at April 2, 2022 and March 27, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 2, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of April  2, 2022, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated May  24, 2022 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved
our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the
critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
End-of-season Markdown Reserves
Description of the
Matter
As disclosed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, estimates for end-of-season markdown reserves are based on
historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, retailer
performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms.
Auditing management's estimate of end-of-season markdown reserves was complex and judgmental as reserve amounts are
sensitive to changes in market or economic conditions (including the effects of the global pandemic), and have a direct, material
impact on the amount of revenue recognized by the Company. There is also significant estimation required to establish
markdown reserve rates by brand and customer, which are based on the Company's review of the seasonal negotiations with
each customer and the expected performance of the products in the customers' stores.
F-57


================================================================================
[PAGE 144 OF 281]
================================================================================
How We Addressed
the Matter in Our
Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the
Company's process to calculate the end-of-season markdown reserves, including the consideration of historical experience,
actual and forecasted seasonal results, current economic and market conditions, (including the effects of the global pandemic),
retailer performance, and contractual terms as applicable.
To test the estimate of end-of-season markdown reserves, we performed audit procedures that included, among others,
assessing methodologies and testing the assumptions regarding seasonal negotiations with each customer which include the
application of market and economic conditions to individual customers and the expected performance of the products in the
customers' stores that were used by the Company to calculate the projected markdown allowances to be issued upon settlement.
We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current market and economic trends, historical results and
other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of
significant assumptions to substantively test the changes in the estimate that would result from reasonable changes in the
assumptions.
Estimated Realizable Value of Inventory
Description of the
Matter
As of April 2, 2022, the Company's net inventory balance was $977.3 million. As described in Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements, the valuation of inventory requires management to make assumptions and judgments about the
recoverability of inventory and its estimated realizable value.
The estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends, market trends and
economic conditions (including the effects of the global pandemic), future sales forecasts, on-hand inventory quantities, and
consideration of the value of existing customer orders for future sales of inventory. Given the importance of inventory to the
Company's operations and the materiality of the balance, coupled with the judgment involved in estimating future sales,
auditing management's estimated realizable value involved a higher extent of testing and the involvement of more senior
members of the engagement team in executing, supervising and reviewing the results of the procedures.
How We Addressed
the Matter in Our
Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the process to
determine the estimated realizable value of inventory, including controls over the inputs and assumptions used in management's
calculation as described above.
Our audit procedures to test the estimated realizable value of inventory included, among others, evaluating the appropriateness
of management's inputs to the calculation, including testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in management's
calculation such as historical sales activity and loss rates for each class of inventory, write-off activity, on-hand inventory levels
and inventory aging. Our procedures also included testing the completeness of any expected net losses on firm commitments to
purchase inventory. To evaluate management's ability to accurately estimate future sales projections, which is also a key factor
in the determination of the reserve, we retrospectively reviewed actual sales compared to projections and considered the impact
of the global pandemic on market trends and economic conditions. We also tested the mathematical accuracy of the Company's
calculation.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ralph Lauren Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Ralph Lauren Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of April 2, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
In our opinion, Ralph Lauren Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 2,
2022, based on the COSO criteria.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of April 2, 2022 and March 27, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss),
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 2, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated May 24, 2022 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION
FORM OF NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”), is made, effective as of the ___ day of _____ (the “Grant Date”), between Ralph
Lauren Corporation, a Delaware corporation (hereinafter called the “Company”), and _______ (hereinafter called the

Company who is not an employee of either the Company or any Affiliate (each, an “Outside Director”) as a Participant pursuant to
the Plan and the terms set forth herein.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. Grant of the Restricted Stock Units. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the additional terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the Company hereby grants to the Participant a Restricted Stock Unit Award consisting of ______
Restricted Stock Units (hereinafter called the “RSUs”). The RSUs shall vest and become non-forfeitable in accordance with
Section 2 hereof.
2. Vesting.
(a) Subject to the Participant's continued service as an Outside Director of the Company through _____, the RSUs shall fully
vest and become non-forfeitable on the _____ anniversary of the Grant Date.
(b) Once vested, the RSUs shall be paid to Participant in Shares as soon as administratively practicable, but not later than thirty
(30) days, after their applicable vesting date.

fractional Shares shall be payable in cash.
(d) The RSUs shall be settled exclusively in Class A Common Stock of the Company.



================================================================================
[PAGE 147 OF 281]
================================================================================
(e) If the Participant’s service as an Outside Director of the Company is terminated for any reason other than due to the
Participant’s death or Disability, the RSUs shall, to the extent not then vested, be forfeited by the Participant without
consideration. In the event of the death or disability of the Participant, unvested RSUs shall continue to vest according to
the original vesting schedule.
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in
the Plan), the RSUs shall, to the extent not then vested and not previously forfeited, immediately become fully vested as
contemplated by Section 13 of the Plan.
3. Dividend Equivalents.
(a) The Participant shall be entitled to receive dividend equivalents on the RSUs in the event of an issuance of any cash or
stock dividend on the Shares of the Company (a “Dividend”). The Participant shall be credited with an additional number of
RSUs (each, a “Dividend RSU”), determined as follows:
i.
in the event of a cash dividend, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing: (a) the product of (i) the number of RSUs
that the Participant holds at the time of the record date for such Dividend multiplied by (ii) the amount of the
Dividend per Share, divided by (b) the fair market value per Share on the payment date for such Dividend; and
ii.
in the event of a stock dividend, equal to the number of Shares (including fractions thereof) issued with respect to
each Share, multiplied by the number of RSUs.
(b) Once credited, each Dividend RSU shall be treated as a RSU hereunder and shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions as the RSU from which such Dividend RSU is derived, including, but not limited to, the applicable vesting
schedule and rights to Dividend RSUs with respect to future Dividends.
4. Rights as a Stockholder. Neither the Participant nor any person claiming under or through the Participant will have any of the
rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any RSUs unless and until the RSUs have vested and been issued
as Shares in accordance with the Plan, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to
the Participant. After such vesting, issuance, recordation, and delivery, the Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder of the
Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares.
5. No Right to Continued Service. Neither the Plan nor this Agreement shall be construed as giving the Participant the right to
continue to serve as an Outside Director or to otherwise be retained in the employ of, or in any consulting relationship to, the
Company or any Affiliate. Further, the Company may at any time for any reason terminate the Participant’s services as an Outside
Director and the Company or an Affiliate may dismiss the Participant or discontinue any employment or consulting relationship
with the Participant, in each case free from any liability or any claim under the Plan or this Agreement, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein.
6. Withholding. By accepting this RSU Award, the Participant agrees to make any appropriate arrangements with the Company for
satisfaction of any applicable federal, state or local income

tax, withholding requirements or like requirements, including any payment to the Company upon the vesting of the RSUs (or such
earlier or later date as may be applicable under Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)), or
other settlement in respect of, the RSUs of all such taxes and requirements and the Company shall be authorized to take such action
as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company's counsel (including, without limitation, withholding vested Shares otherwise
deliverable to Participant hereunder and/or withholding amounts from any compensation or other amount owing from the Company
to the Participant ) to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes.
7. No Advice Regarding Award. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any
recommendations regarding the Participant’s participation in the Plan, or his or her acquisition or sale of the underlying RSUs. The
Participant is hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding the Participant’s
participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.
8. Securities Laws. Upon the vesting of any RSUs, the Participant will make or enter into such written representations, warranties
and agreements as the Committee may reasonably request in order to comply with applicable securities laws or with this
Agreement.
9. Exchange Rates. Neither the Company nor any Affiliate shall be liable to a Participant for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation
between the Participant’s local currency and the U.S. Dollar that may affect the value of the Participant’s RSUs or of any amounts
due to the Participant pursuant to the vesting or other settlement of the RSUs or, if applicable, the subsequent sale of Shares
acquired upon vesting.
10. Compliance with Section 409A. The parties acknowledge and agree that, to the extent applicable, this Agreement shall be
interpreted in accordance with, and the parties agree to use their best efforts to achieve timely compliance with, Section 409A of
the Code and the Department of Treasury Regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder (“Section 409A”),
including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Grant Date. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Company determines that anything provided hereunder may be
subject to Section 409A, the Company reserves the right (without any obligation to do so or to indemnify the Participant for failure
to do so) to adopt such limited amendments to this Agreement and appropriate policies and procedures, including amendments and
policies with retroactive effect, that the Company reasonably determines are necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the RSU Award
under this Agreement from Section 409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the RSU Award provided with respect to
this Agreement or (b) comply with the requirements of Section 409A.

executive office of the Company and to the Participant at the address appearing in the records of the Company with respect to such
Participant or to either party at such other address as either party hereto may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such
notice shall be deemed effective upon receipt thereof by the addressee.

For purposes of the foregoing, (i) if both Moody’s and S&P shall not have in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than
by reason of the circumstances referred to in the next-to-last sentence of this definition), then such rating agency shall be deemed to
have established a rating for the Index Debt in Level V; (ii) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established by
Moody’s and S&P for the Index Debt shall fall within different Levels, the Applicable Rate shall be based on the higher of the two
ratings unless one of the two ratings is two or more Levels lower than the other, in which case the Applicable Rate shall be
determined by reference to the Level next below that of the higher of the two ratings; and (iii) if the ratings established or deemed
to have been established by Moody’s and S&P for the Index Debt shall be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating
system of Moody’s or S&P), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating
agency, irrespective of when notice of such change shall have been furnished by the Parent Borrower to the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders pursuant to Section 5.01 or otherwise. Each change in the Applicable Rate shall apply during the period
commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such
change. If the rating system of Moody’s or S&P shall change, or if both such rating agencies shall cease to be in the business of
rating corporate debt obligations, the Parent Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to
reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such rating agencies, and, pending the effectiveness of any
such amendment, the Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or
cessation. If either (but not both) of Moody’s and S&P shall cease to have in effect a rating (whether as a result of such agency
ceasing to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations or otherwise), the Applicable Rate shall be determined by
reference to the rating of the other rating agency.

Agreed Currency, as applicable, any tenor for such Benchmark (or component thereof) or payment period for interest calculated
with reference to such Benchmark (or component thereof), as applicable, that is or may be used for determining the length of an
Interest Period for any term rate or otherwise, for determining any frequency of making payments of interest calculated pursuant to
this Agreement as of such date and not including, for the avoidance of doubt, any tenor for such Benchmark that is then-removed
from the definition of “Interest Period” pursuant to clause (e) of Section 2.12.

of, or indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any such proceeding or appointment, provided that a Bankruptcy
Event shall not result solely by virtue of any ownership interest, or the acquisition of any ownership interest, in such Person by a
Governmental Authority or instrumentality thereof, provided, further, that such ownership interest does not result in or provide
such Person with immunity from the jurisdiction of courts within the United States or from the enforcement of judgments or writs
of attachment on its assets or permit such Person (or such Governmental Authority or instrumentality) to reject, repudiate, disavow
or disaffirm any contracts or agreements made by such Person.

Governmental Body or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a benchmark rate as a replacement
for the then-current Benchmark for syndicated credit facilities denominated in the applicable Agreed Currency at such time in the
United States and (b) the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment;
If the Benchmark Replacement as determined pursuant to clause (1) or (2) above would be less than the Floor, the
Benchmark Replacement will be deemed to be the Floor for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
“Benchmark Replacement Adjustment” means, with respect to any replacement of the then-current Benchmark with
an Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for any applicable Interest Period and Available Tenor for any setting of such Unadjusted
Benchmark Replacement, the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, (which may be

Corresponding Tenor giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a spread adjustment, or method for
calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted
Benchmark Replacement by the Relevant Governmental Body on the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date and/or (ii) any
evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such
spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for syndicated

borrowing requests or prepayment, conversion or continuation notices, length of lookback periods, the applicability of breakage
provisions, and other technical, administrative or operational matters) that the Administrative Agent decides may be appropriate to
reflect the adoption and implementation of such Benchmark and to permit the administration thereof by the Administrative Agent
in a manner substantially consistent with market practice (or, if the Administrative Agent decides that adoption of any portion of
such market practice is not administratively feasible or if the Administrative Agent determines that no market practice for the
administration of such Benchmark exists, in such other manner of administration as the Administrative Agent decides is reasonably
necessary in connection with the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents).
“Benchmark Replacement Date” means, with respect to any Benchmark, the earliest to occur of the following events

(1) in the case of clause (1) or (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Transition Event,” the later of (a) the date of the
public statement or publication of information referenced therein and (b) the date on which the administrator of such Benchmark
(or the published component used in the calculation thereof) permanently or indefinitely ceases to provide all Available Tenors of
such Benchmark (or such component thereof); or
(2) in the case of clause (3) of the definition of “Benchmark Transition Event,” the first date on which such
Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) has been determined and announced by the regulatory
supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) to be no longer representative; provided, that such
non-representativeness will be determined by reference to the most recent statement or publication referenced in such clause (c) and
even if any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) continues to be provided on such date.
For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if the event giving rise to the Benchmark Replacement Date occurs on the same day
as, but earlier than, the Reference Time in respect of any determination, the Benchmark Replacement Date will be deemed to have
occurred prior to the Reference Time for such determination and (ii) the “Benchmark Replacement Date” will be deemed to have
occurred in the case of clause (1) or (2) with respect to any Benchmark upon the occurrence of the applicable event or events set
forth therein with respect to all then-current Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the
calculation thereof).
“Benchmark Transition Event” means, with respect to any Benchmark, the occurrence of one or more of the
following events with respect to such then-current Benchmark:

published component used in the calculation thereof) announcing that such administrator has ceased or will cease to provide all
Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof), permanently or indefinitely, provided that, at the time of such
statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark
(or such component thereof);
(2) a public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such
Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation

case, which states that the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component) has ceased or will cease to provide all Available
Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) permanently or indefinitely; provided that, at the time of such statement or
publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such

acquisition) if, and only if, the Parent Borrower in good faith determines on the date of such calculation that it is reasonable to
expect that such grant will be completed within 120 days following the date of
14

Administrative Agent shall determine the Exchange Rate as of the applicable Exchange Rate Date with respect to each Alternative
Currency in which any requested or outstanding Loan or Alternative Currency Letter of Credit is denominated and shall apply such
Exchange Rate to determine such amount (in each case after giving effect to any Loan to be made or repaid or Letter of Credit to be
issued or to expire or terminate on or prior to the applicable date for such calculation).
(b) For purposes of (i) determining the amount of Indebtedness incurred, outstanding or proposed to be incurred or
outstanding under Section 6.01 (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any calculation of Consolidated Net Worth or

outstanding or proposed to be incurred or outstanding in currencies other than dollars shall be translated into dollars at the
Exchange Rate on the applicable date, provided that no Default shall arise as a result of any limitation set forth in dollars in
Section 6.01 or 6.02 being exceeded solely as a result of changes in Exchange Rates from those rates applicable at the time
or times Indebtedness or obligations secured by Liens were initially consummated or acquired in reliance on the exceptions
under such Sections.
SECTION 1.06. Divisions. For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in connection with any division or plan of division

of this Agreement shall indicate, in the Assignment and Assumption or the New Lender Supplement whether it is a Swiss
Qualifying Bank or a Swiss Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank. If a Lender does not declare its status as a Swiss Qualifying Bank or a
Swiss Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank or declares its status in that regard to be unknown, such Lender shall be treated as a Lender
which is not a Swiss Qualifying Bank or a Swiss Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank.
SECTION 1.08. Interest Rates; Benchmark Notification. The interest rate on a Loan denominated in dollars or an
Alternative Currency may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that may be discontinued or is, or may in the future become,
the subject of regulatory reform. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, Section 2.12(b) provides a mechanism for
determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not
have any liability with respect to, the
44

[PAGE 199 OF 281]
================================================================================
administration, submission, performance or any other matter related to any interest rate used in this Agreement, or with respect to
any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or
characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or
economic equivalence of, the existing interest rate being replaced or have the same volume or liquidity as did any existing interest
rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or other related entities may
engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any interest rate used in this Agreement or any alternative, successor or
alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse
to the Borrower. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any
interest rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of
any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in
tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof)
provided by any such information source or service.

the Administrative Agent (which consent of the Administrative Agent shall not be unreasonably withheld), elects to become a
“Lender” under this Agreement in connection with any transaction described in Section 2.01(b) shall execute a New Lender
Supplement (each, a “New Lender Supplement”), substantially in the form of Exhibit D-1, whereupon such bank, financial
institution or other entity (a “New Lender”) shall become a Lender, with a Commitment in the amount set forth therein that is
effective on the date specified therein, for all purposes and to the same extent as if originally a party hereto and shall be bound by
and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement.

Commitment after giving effect to such Commitment increase, and (iii) the date upon which such Commitment increase shall
become effective.
(e)
Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, on each date upon which the Commitments shall be
increased pursuant to this Section, each Borrower shall prepay all then outstanding Loans made to it, which prepayment shall be
accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and any amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 in
connection therewith, and, to the extent it determines to do so, reborrow Loans from all the Lenders (after giving effect to the new
and/or increased Commitments becoming effective on such date). Any prepayment and reborrowing pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be effected, to the maximum extent practicable, through the netting of amounts payable between each applicable
Borrower and the respective Lenders.
SECTION 2.02. Loans and Borrowings. (a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans
made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan
required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the
Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender’s failure to make Loans as required.
(b)
Subject to Section 2.12, each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans, Term Benchmark Loans,
or RFR Loans as the Parent Borrower may request on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower in accordance herewith.
Each Lender at its option may make any Term Benchmark Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such
Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to
repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and provided, further, that no such option may be exercised by
any Lender if, immediately after giving effect thereto, amounts would become payable by a Loan Party under Section 2.13 or 2.15
that are in excess of those that would be payable under such Section if such option were not exercised.
(c)
At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Term Benchmark Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be
in an aggregate amount that is (i) in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in dollars, an integral multiple of
$500,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) in the case of an Alternative Currency Borrowing, the Dollar Equivalent of

made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $500,000;
provided that an ABR Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total
Commitments or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.04(e).
Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a
total of 15 Term Benchmark Borrowings outstanding.
(d)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Borrower shall be entitled to request, or to elect
to convert or continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date.
(e)
Each Lender may, at its option, make any Loan available to any Subsidiary Borrower by causing any foreign
or domestic branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not increase the
costs to such Subsidiary Borrower with respect to such Loan or affect the obligation of such Subsidiary Borrower to repay such
Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

of any other Borrower) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by hand delivery, telecopy or (pursuant to procedures

Person (i) to fund any activity or business of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in any country or territory that, at the time of such

issuance or increase in any Letter of Credit to determine whether or not such issuance or increase would result in any of the
limitations set forth in the preceding sentence being exceeded. For purposes of this Section 2.04(b), a “Notification Instruction”
shall mean any instruction from the Administrative Agent requiring that an Issuing Bank make the calculations described in the
preceding sentence, which instruction the Administrative Agent (i) may deliver at any time when it determines that the percentage

such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration
and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent
in dollars, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of (i) each LC

Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank in dollars and (ii) the Dollar Equivalent, using the Exchange Rate at the time such
payment is made, of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank in an Alternative Currency and, in each case, not
reimbursed by the Parent Borrower (or a Subsidiary) on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any
reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Parent Borrower (or a Subsidiary) for any reason. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or
extension of any Letter of Credit, the occurrence and continuance of a Default or failure to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in
Article IV, the reduction or termination of the Commitments, any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such
Lender may have against the Issuing Bank, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, any adverse change in the
condition (financial or otherwise) of any Borrower, any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower or
any other Loan Party or any other Lender or any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any
of the foregoing and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
(e)
Reimbursement. If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the
Parent Borrower (or the Subsidiary that is jointly and severally liable with respect to such Letter of Credit) shall reimburse such LC
Disbursement by paying to such Issuing Bank an amount equal to such LC Disbursement in dollars, on the date that such LC
Disbursement is made (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on or before the next Business Day); provided that, if such LC
Disbursement is made under an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, automatically and with no further action required, the Parent
Borrower’s (or such Subsidiary’s) obligation to reimburse the applicable LC Disbursement shall be permanently converted into an
obligation to reimburse the Dollar Equivalent, calculated using the Exchange Rate at the time such payment is made, of such LC
Disbursement, and provided, further, that, in the case of any such reimbursement obligation which is in an amount of not less than
$500,000, the Parent Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03
that such payment be financed in dollars with an ABR Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Parent
Borrower’s (and such Subsidiary’s) obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR
Borrowing. If the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary) fails to make when due any reimbursement payment required pursuant to
this paragraph, the applicable Issuing Bank shall immediately notify the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify each
Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the Dollar Equivalent thereof calculated in accordance with the preceding sentence (if
such LC Disbursement relates to an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit), the reimbursement payment then due from the Parent
Borrower (or such Subsidiary) in respect thereof and such Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of
such notice, each Lender (other than such Issuing Bank) shall pay to the Administrative Agent in dollars its Applicable Percentage
of the reimbursement payment then due from the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary), in the same manner as provided in Section
2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.05 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the
Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to such Issuing Bank in dollars the amounts so received by it from the
Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary)
pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the
50


================================================================================
[PAGE 205 OF 281]
================================================================================
applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing
Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Loans or RFR Loans as
contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Parent Borrower (and such Subsidiary) of its obligation to
reimburse such LC Disbursement.
(f)
Letter of Credit Fees.
(i)
Commercial Letter of Credit Fee. The Parent Borrower (or the Subsidiary that is jointly and severally liable
with respect to the Letter of Credit in question) agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable
Issuing Bank and the Lenders, a Commercial Letter of Credit fee calculated at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable
Rate applicable to Commercial Letters of Credit from time to time in effect on the aggregate average daily amount
available to be drawn (calculated, in the case of any Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, on the basis of the Dollar
Equivalent thereof using the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date payment of such fee is due) under each
Commercial Letter of Credit issued hereunder. Commercial Letter of Credit Fees accrued through and including the last
day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable in arrears on the fifth Business Day following
such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. The Administrative Agent will promptly
pay to the Issuing Banks and the Lenders their pro rata shares of any amounts received from the Parent Borrower (or such
Subsidiary) in respect of any such fees. Commercial Letter of Credit fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360
days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
(ii)
Standby Letter of Credit Fees. The Parent Borrower (or the Subsidiary that is jointly and severally liable with
respect to the Letter of Credit in question) agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable
Issuing Bank and the Lenders, a Standby Letter of Credit fee calculated at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate
applicable to Term Benchmark Loans from time to time in effect on the aggregate average daily amount available to be
drawn (calculated, in the case of any Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, on the basis of the Dollar Equivalent thereof
using the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date payment of such fee is due) under each Standby Letter of Credit
issued hereunder (and in no event less than $500 with respect to each such Standby Letter of Credit). Standby Letter of
Credit Fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be
payable in arrears on the fifth Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the
date hereof. The Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing Banks and the Lenders their pro rata shares of any
amounts received from the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary) in respect of any such fees. Standby Letter of Credit fees
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day).
(g)
Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Parent Borrower (or the Subsidiary that is jointly and severally
liable with respect to the Letter of Credit in question) to
51


================================================================================
[PAGE 206 OF 281]
================================================================================
reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall
be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective
of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, any application for the issuance of a Letter of Credit or this
Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be
forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the
applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the
terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing,
that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the
Parent Borrower’s (or such Subsidiary’s) obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing
Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or
transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances
referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft,
notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing
thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
applicable Issuing Bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 2.04(g) shall be construed to excuse such Issuing
Bank, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent from liability to the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary) to the extent of any direct
damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the
Parent Borrower (and such Subsidiary) to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Parent Borrower (or such
Subsidiary) that are caused by (x) such Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other
documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof or (y) the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of such Issuing Bank, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent as found by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have
exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties
agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a
Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make
payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
(h)
Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine
all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower (and the Subsidiary that is jointly and severally liable with respect to the Letter of
Credit in question, if applicable) in writing (by hand delivery, telecopy or (pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative
Agent) electronic transmission) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC
Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Parent Borrower (or
the Subsidiary that is jointly and severally liable with respect to the Letter of
52


================================================================================
[PAGE 207 OF 281]
================================================================================
Credit in question) of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
(i)
Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Parent Borrower (or
the Subsidiary that is jointly and severally liable with respect to the Letter of Credit in question) shall reimburse such LC
Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, including by financing such payment obligation with an ABR
Loan in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on or prior to the next Business Day),
the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but
excluding the date that the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary) reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then
applicable to ABR Loans or RFR Loans; provided that, if the Parent Borrower (or such Subsidiary) fails to reimburse such LC
Disbursement when due (including by financing such payment obligation with an ABR Loan) pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
Section, then Section 2.11(d) shall apply; and provided, further, that, in the case of an LC Disbursement made under an Alternative
Currency Letter of Credit, the amount of interest due with respect thereto shall accrue on the Dollar Equivalent, calculated using
the Exchange Rate at the time such LC Disbursement was made, of such LC Disbursement. Interest accrued pursuant to this
paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by
any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the
extent of such payment.
(j)
Replacement and Resignation of any Issuing Bank. Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written
agreement among the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of such Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement
shall become effective, the Parent Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant
to Section 2.04(f) and 2.10(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have
all the rights and obligations of such Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and
(ii) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to include a reference to such successor or to any previous Issuing
Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank
hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required
to issue additional Letters of Credit or extend or otherwise amend an existing Letter of Credit. Subject to the appointment and
acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, any Issuing Bank may resign as an Issuing Bank at any time upon 30 days’ prior written
notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders, in which case, such resigning Issuing Bank shall be replaced in
accordance with this Section.
(k)
Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the
Parent Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been
accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the then total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of
cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Parent Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the
name of the
53


================================================================================
[PAGE 208 OF 281]
================================================================================
Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in dollars and in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date
plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that (i) the portions of such amount attributable to undrawn Alternative
Currency Letters of Credit shall be deposited in the applicable Alternative Currencies in the actual amounts of such undrawn
Letters of Credit and (ii) the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall
become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default
with respect to the Parent Borrower described in paragraph (h) or (i) of Article VII. Each deposit pursuant to this paragraph shall be
held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Parent Borrower (and any
Subsidiary for whose account a Letter of Credit has been issued) under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have
exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on
the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and
at the Parent Borrower’s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall
accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Banks
for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed (to be applied ratably among them according to the respective
aggregate amounts of the then unreimbursed LC Disbursements) and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction
of the reimbursement obligations of the Parent Borrower (and each such Subsidiary) for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the
maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50%
of the then total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Parent Borrower (and each such Subsidiary) under this
Agreement. If the Parent Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an
Event of Default or, in accordance with Section 2.09(c), the total Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding 105% of the total
Commitments, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Parent Borrower within three Business
Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived or, as the case may be, the total Revolving Credit Exposure not
exceeding the total Commitments.
(l)
Additional Issuing Banks. The Parent Borrower may, at any time and from time to time with the consent of
the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such Lender, designate one or more additional
Lenders to act as an issuing bank under the terms of this Agreement, provided that the total number of Issuing Banks at any time
shall not exceed four. Any Lender designated as Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph (l) shall be deemed to be an “Issuing
Bank” for the purposes of this Agreement (in addition to being a Lender) with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Lender.
(m)
Reporting. Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise agrees, each Issuing Bank will report in writing to the
Administrative Agent, with a copy to the Parent Borrower, (i) on the first Business Day of each week and on the second Business
Day to occur after the last day of each March, June, September and December, and on such other dates as the Administrative Agent
may reasonably request, the daily activity during the preceding week, calendar quarter or other period, as the case may be, with
respect to Letters of Credit issued by it, including the aggregate outstanding LC Exposure with respect to such Letters of Credit on
each day during such week, quarter or other period, in such form and detail as shall be satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (ii)
on any Business Day on which the Parent Borrower fails to
54


================================================================================
[PAGE 209 OF 281]
================================================================================
reimburse an LC Disbursement required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such failure and the amount
of such LC Disbursement and (iii) such other information with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank as the
Administrative Agent may reasonably request.
SECTION 2.05. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the
proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon., New York City time, to the account of the
Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that if an ABR Borrowing
is requested for disbursement on the same day after 11:00 a.m., New York time, then each Lender shall make the Loan to be made
by it hereunder in such manner by 3:00 p.m., New York City time. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the
applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the applicable Borrower
maintained with the Administrative Agent and designated by the Parent Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided
that ABR Loans or RFR Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.04(e) shall be
remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.
(b)
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed time of any
Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available at such time in accordance with paragraph (a) of
this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In
such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the
date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent
in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative
Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. If such Lender’s share of such
Borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after the date such
amount is made available to the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Parent Borrower and any
other applicable Borrower of such failure and shall also be entitled to recover such amount from the applicable Borrower, on
demand, with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans or RFR Loans hereunder accruing from the date of
such Borrowing. If the Parent Borrower or the applicable Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding
amount, the Parent Borrower and such applicable Borrower shall have no further obligations to such Lender with respect to such
amount.
SECTION 2.06. Interest Elections. (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) may elect to convert
such Borrowing (i) in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in dollars, to an ABR Borrowing; or (ii) in the case of
an ABR Borrowing, to a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in dollars or to continue such Borrowing in the same currency
and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in
55


================================================================================
[PAGE 210 OF 281]
================================================================================
this Section. The Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself or any other Borrower) may elect different options with respect to different
portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans
comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
(b)
To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of another
Borrower) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by hand delivery, telecopy or electronic transmission (pursuant to
procedures approved by the Administrative Agent) to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form
approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Parent Borrower by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required
under Section 2.03 if the Parent Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the
effective date of such election. Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable.
(c)
Each Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i)
the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with
respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the
information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii)
the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business
Day;
(iii)
whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Term Benchmark Borrowing; and
(iv)
if the resulting Borrowing is a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after
giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the
Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of another Borrower) shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one
month’s duration.
(d)
Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each
Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e)
If the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of another Borrower) fails to deliver a timely Interest
Election Request with respect to a Term Benchmark Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then,
unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing (i) if denominated in dollars,
shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) if denominated in an Alternative Currency, shall be converted to a one month
Interest Period denominated in the same currency as the Term Benchmark Borrowing being continued. Notwithstanding any
contrary provision
56


================================================================================
[PAGE 211 OF 281]
================================================================================
hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders,
so notifies the Parent Borrower, then, so long as such Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing denominated in
dollars may be converted to or continued as a Term Benchmark Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Term Benchmark Borrowing
denominated in dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
(f)
By entering into this Agreement, the parties hereto have assumed in good faith that the interest payable at the
rates specified in this Agreement is not and will not be subject to any Tax deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax.
Nevertheless, if a Tax deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax is required by Swiss law to be made by a Swiss Borrower in
respect of any interest payable by it under a Loan Document and should it be unlawful for a Swiss Borrower to comply with
Section 2.15 for any reason, and if the gross-up in accordance with Section 2.15 is effectively not paid: (i) the applicable interest
rate in relation to that interest payment shall be (A) the interest rate which would have applied to that interest payment in the
absence of this Section 2.06(f), divided by (B) one minus the rate at which the relevant deduction on account of Swiss Withholding
Tax is required to be made (where the rate at which the relevant deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax is required to be
made is for this purpose expressed as a fraction of one rather than as a percentage); (ii) (A) a Swiss Borrower shall be obliged to
pay the relevant interest at the adjusted rate as set forth in this Section 2.06(f), and (B) a Swiss Borrower shall make the deduction
on account of Swiss Withholding Tax (within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law) on the interest so
recalculated; and (iii) all references to a rate of interest under a Loan Document applicable to a Swiss Borrower shall be construed
accordingly. To the extent that interest payable by a Swiss Borrower under this Agreement becomes subject to a deduction of Swiss
Withholding Tax, each relevant Lender and the Swiss Borrower shall promptly cooperate in completing any procedural formalities
(including submitting forms and documents required by the appropriate Tax authority) to the extent possible and necessary for the
Swiss Borrower to obtain authorization to make interest payments without them being subject to such deduction of Swiss
Withholding Tax or to reduce the applicable withholding tax rate. If a Swiss Borrower pays the interest recalculated under this
Section 2.06(f), the Swiss Borrower shall cooperate with each relevant Lender to enable that Lender to receive a full or partial
refund of the Swiss Withholding Tax under an applicable double taxation treaty. In the event Swiss Withholding Tax is refunded to
a Lender by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, the relevant Lender shall immediately forward such amount to the Swiss
Borrower. This Section 2.06(f) shall not apply and no interest shall be recalculated pursuant to this Section 2.06(f) if a deduction of
Swiss Withholding Tax is due as a result of any non-compliance by a Lender with the provisions of Section 10.04 or the Lender (i)
making a misrepresentation as to its status according to Section 1.07 as a Swiss Qualifying Bank or as (only) one Swiss Permitted
Non-Qualifying Bank or (ii) ceasing to be a Swiss Qualifying Bank or as (only) one Swiss Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank after
the time it acceded to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) a Lender
who is not treated as not being a Swiss Qualifying Bank shall not be under any obligation to change its status into a Swiss
Qualifying Bank, (ii) the documentation which a Lender executes on becoming a party hereto shall not be invalidated by any failure
of a Lender to comply with this Section 2.06(f), Section 10.04 or Section 1.07 and (iii) none of the Loan Documents shall be
invalidated by any failure of a Lender to comply with this Section 2.06(f), Section 10.04(b)(i)(A) or Section 1.07 or indicates its
status as a Swiss Qualifying Bank or Swiss Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank as unknown.
57


================================================================================
[PAGE 212 OF 281]
================================================================================
SECTION 2.07. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless previously terminated in accordance
with this Agreement, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
(b)
The Parent Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; provided
that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than
$1,000,000, or, if less than $1,000,000, the remaining amount of the total Commitments, and (ii) the Parent Borrower shall
not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance
with Section 2.09, the total Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.
(c)
The Parent Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the
Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least two Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination
or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the
Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Parent Borrower
pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the
Parent Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon another event, such as the effectiveness of other credit
facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Parent Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or
prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments
shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Commitments.
SECTION 2.08. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to
pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan made to such
Borrower on the Maturity Date.
(b)
Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender to such Borrower, including the
amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(c)
The Administrative Agent shall maintain a Register pursuant to Section 10.04(b)(iv) and an account for each
Lender in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type and currency thereof and the Interest Period
applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to
each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the
Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.
(d)
The entries made in the accounts and Register maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section
shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of
any Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
58


================================================================================
[PAGE 213 OF 281]
================================================================================
(e)
Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the
applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if
requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent.
Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant
to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or,
if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
SECTION 2.09. Prepayment of Loans. (a) Each Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to
prepay voluntarily any Borrowing made to such Borrower in whole or in part without premium or penalty, subject to prior notice in
accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.
(b)
The Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) shall notify the Administrative
Agent in writing (by hand delivery, telecopy or (pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent) electronic
transmission) of any voluntary prepayment hereunder prior to (i) in the case of ABR Loans or RFR Loans, 11:00 a.m., New York
City time, on such date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of Term Benchmark Loans denominated in dollars, 12:00 noon, New York
City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding such date of prepayment, (iii) in the case of Term Benchmark Loans
denominated in Euros, 12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business Days prior to such date of prepayment and (iv) in the case
of Term Benchmark Loans denominated in any Alternative Currencies other than Euros, 12:00 noon, New York City time, four
Business Days prior to such date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the
principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and whether the prepayment is of Term Benchmark Loans,
ABR Loans, RFR Loans or a combination thereof, and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each; provided that, if a
notice of voluntary prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as
contemplated by Section 2.07, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in
accordance with Section 2.07. Promptly following receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of
the contents thereof. Each partial voluntary prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $500,000 or
a multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or the Dollar Equivalent thereof). Each voluntary prepayment of a Borrowing shall be
applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.
(c)
If on any Exchange Rate Date the Administrative Agent determines that the total Revolving Credit Exposure
exceeds 105% of the total Commitments, the Borrowers shall within three Business Days after such date, prepay Loans and/or
deposit cash collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent established and maintained in accordance with Section 2.04(k)
in an aggregate amount such that, after deducting therefrom the amount so prepaid and/or so deposited in such account, the total
Revolving Credit Exposure does not exceed the total Commitments. The Administrative Agent shall promptly release any collateral
theretofore deposited with it pursuant to this Section 2.09 to the extent that on any Exchange Rate Date the total Revolving Credit
Exposure does not exceed the total Commitments.

(d)
Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.11 and any
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14.
SECTION 2.10. Fees. (a) The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
Lender a commitment fee for the period from and including the Effective Date to the last day of the Availability Period, computed
at the Applicable Rate on the average daily amount of the Available Commitment of such Lender during the period for which
payment is made. Commitment fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each
year shall be payable on the fifth Business Day following such last day, commencing on October 7, 2019; provided that all such
fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the

and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
(b)
The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing Bank the fees agreed upon by the Parent Borrower with
such Issuing Bank with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings
thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, in any case where, in accordance with the second sentence of the definition of Issuing
Bank, an Issuing Bank arranges for one or more Letters of Credit to be issued by an Affiliate of such Issuing Bank, the fees agreed
upon by such Issuing Bank with the Parent Borrower shall be deemed to have been agreed upon by such Affiliate unless the Parent
Borrower and such Affiliate otherwise agree.
(c)
The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the
amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
(d)
All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the
Administrative Agent (or to each Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees
and participation fees, to the Lenders. Except as may be expressly agreed in writing between the Parent Borrower and the
Administrative Agent with respect to fees to the Administrative Agent, fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances
(other than in the case, and to the extent, of any overpayment thereof by the applicable Borrower).
SECTION 2.11. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base
Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
(b)
The Loans comprising each Term Benchmark Borrowing shall bear interest in the case of a Term Benchmark
Loan, at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, the Adjusted HKD Rate or the Adjusted TIBOR Rate, as
applicable, for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
(c)
Each RFR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple RFR
plus the Applicable Rate.
(d)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable
by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at
60


================================================================================
[PAGE 215 OF 281]
================================================================================
stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided
in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as
provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
(e)
Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and,
in the case of Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d)
of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment
of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid
shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Term Benchmark
Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of
such conversion.
(f)
Interest computed by reference to the Term SOFR Rate, the EURIBOR Rate or Daily Simple RFR with
respect to Dollars hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days. Interest computed by reference to the Daily
Simple RFR with respect to Sterling, the TIBOR Rate or the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on
the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year). In each case interest shall be
payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). All interest hereunder on any
Loan shall be computed on a daily basis based upon the outstanding principal amount of such Loan as of the applicable date of
determination. The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, EURIBOR Rate,
Adjusted HKD Rate, HKD Rate, Adjusted TIBOR Rate, TIBOR Rate, Adjusted Daily Simple RFR or Daily Simple RFR shall be
determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.12. Alternate Rate of Interest. (a) If, subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.12,
(i)
the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error) that by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market (i) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for
a Term Benchmark Borrowing, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Term SOFR
Rate, the Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate or the EURIBOR Rate, the Adjusted HKD Rate or the HKD Rate,
the Adjusted TIBOR Rate or the TIBOR Rate (including because the Relevant Screen Rate is not available or published on
a current basis), for the applicable Agreed Currency and such Interest Period or (ii) at any time, that adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Daily Simple RFR or RFR for the applicable Agreed
Currency; or
(ii)
the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that (i) prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing, Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted
EURIBOR Rate or the EURIBOR Rate, the Adjusted HKD Rate, the HKD Rate, the Adjusted TIBOR Rate or the TIBOR

================================================================================
[PAGE 216 OF 281]
================================================================================
Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency and such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for the applicable
Agreed Currency and such Interest Period or (ii) at any time, the applicable Daily Simple RFR or RFR for the applicable
Agreed Currency will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their
Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for the applicable Agreed Currency;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Parent Borrower (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other
Borrower) and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent
notifies the Parent Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist(which notice by
Administrative Agent shall be prompt in such circumstances), (A) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any
Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Term Benchmark Borrowing shall be ineffective, (B) if
any Borrowing Request requests a Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR
Borrowing and (C) if any Borrowing Request requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing or an RFR Borrowing for the relevant rate
above in an Alternative Currency, then such request shall be ineffective; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such
notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then all other Types of Borrowings shall be permitted. Furthermore, if any Term
Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan in any Agreed Currency is outstanding on the date of the Parent Borrower’s receipt of the notice
from the Administrative Agent referred to in this Error! Reference source not found. with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable
to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until the Administrative Agent notifies the Parent Borrower and the Lenders that
the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) if such Term Benchmark Loan is denominated in Dollars, then on
the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day),
such Loan shall be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars on such
day, (ii) if such Term Benchmark Loan is denominated in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, then such Loan shall, on the last
day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day) bear
interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency plus the Applicable Rate; provided that, if the Administrative
Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the
applicable Agreed Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected Term Benchmark Loans denominated in any Agreed
Currency other than Dollars shall, at the Borrower’s election prior to such day: (A) be prepaid by the Borrower on such day or (B)
solely for the purpose of calculating the interest rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan, such Term Benchmark Loan
denominated in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars shall be deemed to be a Term Benchmark Loan denominated in Dollars
and shall accrue interest at the same interest rate applicable to Term Benchmark Loans denominated in Dollars at such time or (iii)
if such RFR Loan is denominated in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, then such Loan shall bear interest at the Central Bank
Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency plus the Applicable Rate; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency
cannot be determined, any outstanding affected RFR Loans denominated in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, at the
Borrower’s election, shall either (A) be converted
62


================================================================================
[PAGE 217 OF 281]
================================================================================
into ABR Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency) immediately
or (B) be prepaid in full immediately.
(b)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition
Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-
current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) or (2) of the definition of
“Benchmark Replacement” with respect to Dollars for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will
replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and
subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (3) of the definition of
“Benchmark Replacement” with respect to any Agreed Currency for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark
Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark
setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark
Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of
objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.
(c) In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming
Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments
implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of
any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
(d) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Parent Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a
Benchmark Transition Event (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark
Replacement Conforming Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (f) below and
(v) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be
made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.12, including any
determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date
and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and
may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.12.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in
connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term
SOFR, EURIBOR Rate, or TIBOR Rate) and either (a) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other
information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by
63


================================================================================
[PAGE 218 OF 281]
================================================================================
the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (b) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has
provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer
representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after
such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above
either (a) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or
(b) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a
Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for all Benchmark settings
at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
(f) Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the
Borrower may revoke any request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term
Benchmark Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, either (x) the
Borrower will be deemed to have converted any request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars into a request
for a Borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans or (y) any Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing denominated in an
Alternative Currency shall be ineffective. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-
current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for
such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR
Loan in any Agreed Currency is outstanding on the date of the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark
Unavailability Period with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until such time
as a Benchmark Replacement for such Agreed Currency is implemented pursuant to this Section 2.12, (i) if such Term Benchmark
Loan is denominated in Dollars, then on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business
Day if such day is not a Business Day), such Loan shall be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR
Loan denominated in Dollars on such day, (ii) if such Term Benchmark Loan is denominated in any Agreed Currency other than
Dollars, then such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if
such day is not a Business Day) bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency plus the Applicable Rate;
provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error)
that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected Term Benchmark
Loans denominated in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars shall, at the Borrower’s election prior to such day: (a) be prepaid by
the Borrower on such day or (b) solely for the purpose of calculating the interest rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan,
such Term Benchmark Loan denominated in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars shall be deemed to be a Term Benchmark
Loan denominated in Dollars and shall accrue interest at the same interest rate applicable to Term Benchmark Loans denominated
in Dollars at such time or (iii) if such RFR Loan is denominated in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, then such Loan shall
bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency plus the Applicable Rate; provided that, if the
Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central
Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected RFR Loans denominated in any
Agreed Currency, at the Borrower’s election, shall
64


================================================================================
[PAGE 219 OF 281]
================================================================================
either (a) be converted into ABR Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative
Currency) immediately or (b) be prepaid in full immediately.
SECTION 2.13. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:
(i)
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of,
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the
Adjusted Term SOFR Rate) or any Issuing Bank;
(ii)
impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this
Agreement or Term Benchmark Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; or
(iii)
shall subject the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank to any Taxes (other than (A)
Indemnified Taxes indemnified under Section 2.15, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (f) of the definition of
Excluded Taxes or (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other
obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender (or in the case of (iii) to such Administrative
Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank) of making or maintaining any Term Benchmark Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make
such Loan) or to increase the cost to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or
maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the Administrative Agent, such
Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Parent Borrower will pay to the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, upon demand of such Person, such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional
costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)
If any Lender or any Issuing Bank reasonably determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or
liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s capital
(or on the capital of any corporation controlling such Lender or such Issuing Bank) as a consequence of this Agreement or the
Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a
level below that which such Lender or such controlling corporation could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s or such controlling corporation’s policies with respect to capital adequacy or
liquidity), then from time to time the Parent Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such controlling corporation for any such
reduction suffered.
(c)
A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate
such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a), (b) or (e) of this Section, containing (i) a
reasonably detailed explanation of the basis on which such amount or amounts were calculated and the Change in Law by reason of
which it has become entitled to be so compensated and (ii) confirmation of the
65


================================================================================
[PAGE 220 OF 281]
================================================================================
matters set forth in the last sentence of Section 2.13(d), shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. No Lender or Issuing Bank shall be entitled to the benefits of this Section 2.13 unless such Lender or Issuing Bank
shall have complied with the requirements of this Section 2.13. The Parent Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d)
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this
Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the
Parent Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or
reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the
Parent Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or such Issuing
Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.13, no Lender or Issuing Bank shall demand compensation for any
increased costs or reduction referred to above in this Section if it shall not then be the general policy of such Lender to demand
such compensation in similar circumstances from comparable borrowers under comparable provisions of other credit agreements, if
any (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that a waiver by any Lender or Issuing Bank in any given case of its right to
demand such compensation from any given borrower shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to constitute a change in the general
policy of such Lender).
(e)
If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan to a Subsidiary Borrower that is a Foreign
Subsidiary is increased (or the amount of any sum received or receivable by any Lender or its lending office is reduced) by an
amount deemed by such Lender to be material, by reason of the fact that such Subsidiary Borrower is a Foreign Subsidiary, such
Subsidiary Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for such increased cost or reduction within 15 days after demand by such Lender
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), which such Lender shall make within 90 days from the day such Lender has notice of
such increased cost or reduction.
SECTION 2.14. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Term
Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default),
(b) the conversion of any Term Benchmark Loan into an ABR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Term Benchmark Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.09(b) and is revoked in accordance
therewith), or (d) the assignment of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto
as a result of a request by the Parent Borrower pursuant to Section 2.17, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall
compensate each Lender for the loss and reasonable cost and expense attributable to such event (excluding loss of margin). In the
case of a Term Benchmark Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount reasonably
determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount
of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted
66


================================================================================
[PAGE 221 OF 281]
================================================================================
Term SOFR Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the
then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been
the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at
the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the applicable
currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the applicable Term Benchmark market. A certificate of any
Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, containing a reasonably
detailed calculation of such amounts, shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The
applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
No Lender or Issuing Bank shall be entitled to the benefits of this Section 2.14 unless such Lender or Issuing Bank shall have
complied with the requirements of this Section 2.14.
SECTION 2.15. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any
Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any
applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding
of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such
deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be
increased as necessary so that, after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15), the amounts received with respect to this agreement equal the sum
which would have been received had no such deduction or withholding been made. The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse
it for, Other Taxes.
(c)
Each Loan Party shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and any Issuing Bank, as promptly
as possible but in any event within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment
by or on account of any obligation of such Loan Party under any Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and including any penalties, interest and reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability, together
with, to the extent available, a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other
evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to such Loan Party, delivered to such Loan Party as soon as practicable after any
such payment by a Lender or any Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or any
Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)
As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a
Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
issued by such Governmental
67


================================================================================
[PAGE 222 OF 281]
================================================================================
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e)
A payment to a Lender shall not be increased under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.15 and no
indemnification is due under paragraph (c) of this Section 2.15 if on the date on which the payment falls due the payment could
have been made without any deduction on account of Swiss Withholding Tax (i) had the Lender correctly declared its status as to
whether it is a Swiss Qualifying Bank, (ii) had the Lender complied with the assignment, transfer or exposure transfer restrictions
pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) had the Lender not ceased to be a Swiss Qualifying Bank, or (iv) had the Swiss Non-Bank Rules
not been breached as a result of an assignment or transfer of rights and obligations under this Agreement after the occurrence of an
Event of Default.
(f)
(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax, with respect to
payments made under this Agreement or any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and
executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or
the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such
Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set
forth in Section 2.15(f)(ii)(A) and (ii)(B) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion,
execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the
legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii)
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person,
(A)
any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or
prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such
Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(B)
any Lender that is not a U.S. Person shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the
date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable
request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(iii)
in the case of Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a
party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of the applicable IRS Form W-8
establishing an exemption
68


================================================================================
[PAGE 223 OF 281]
================================================================================
from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any
other applicable payments under any Loan Document, the applicable IRS Form W-8 establishing an exemption from, or reduction
of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;
(iv)
executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(v)
in the case of Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section
881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Lender is not a “bank” within the
meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)
(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance
Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of the applicable IRS Form W-8; or to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial
owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, the applicable IRS Form W-8, a U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents
from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if such Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners
of such Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(A)
any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such
Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for
claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary
documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the
withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(B)
If a payment made to a Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document would be subject to
U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting
requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable, or those under
an intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of Sections 1471 through 1474 of the
Code), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at
such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by
applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with
such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for
purposes of this Section 2.15(f)(v)(B), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Credit
Agreement.
69


================================================================================
[PAGE 224 OF 281]
================================================================================
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any
respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its
legal inability to do so.
(g)
Each Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full
amount of any Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority, together with any reasonable costs and expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, that are attributable (i) to such Lender and that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent and (ii) to a
Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.
(h)
If the Administrative Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Bank determines that it has received a refund which, in
the good faith judgment of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, is allocable to any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan Party has
paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.15, it shall promptly pay over such refund to such Loan Party (but only to the
extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 2.15 with respect to the
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative
Agent or such Lender or such Issuing Bank and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that such Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such
Lender or such Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges
imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority attributable to such amount (including the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
described above of the Administrative Agent or such Lender or such Issuing Bank)) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender or
such Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender or such Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to
such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender or an Issuing
Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Loan Party
or any other Person.
(i)
For purposes of this Section, the term “Lender” includes any Issuing Bank and the term “applicable law”
includes FATCA.
SECTION 2.16. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. (a) Each Borrower shall make
each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or
of amounts payable under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due,
in immediately available funds, without set‑off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the
discretion of the Administrative Agent or an Issuing Bank, as applicable, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its
offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, 7th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60603-2300 and to the wire instructions of the Administrative
Agent set forth in Section 9.06 (or such other address or wire instructions of the Administrative Agent that may be provided from
70


================================================================================
[PAGE 225 OF 281]
================================================================================
time to time by the Administrative Agent), except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein
and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The
Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate
recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for
payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon
shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars except (i) payments of principal
of and interest on any Alternative Currency Loan shall be paid in the applicable currency and (ii) as provided in Section 2.04(k).
(b)
If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all
amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest, fees, expenses and other amounts then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest, fees, expenses and other amounts then due hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest, fees, expenses and other amounts then due to such parties, and
(ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amounts received from any Guarantor shall be applied to Excluded Swap Obligations of such
Guarantor.
(c)
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set‑off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in
respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving
payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest
thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for
cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so
that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of
and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations
are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be
construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement
or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or
participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the applicable Borrower or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply), or any payment obtained pursuant to a court order. Each
Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender
acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of
such participation.
(d)
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the
71


================================================================================
[PAGE 226 OF 281]
================================================================================
account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent
may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has
not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry
rules on interbank compensation.
(e)
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(d) or (e),
2.05(b) or 2.16(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any
amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under
such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
(f)
In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Subsidiary Borrower hereby
appoints the Parent Borrower to act as agent on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower for the purpose of (i) giving any notices or
requests contemplated to be given by such Subsidiary Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation,
Borrowing Requests, prepayment notices and Interest Election Requests and (ii) paying on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower any
Subsidiary Obligations owing by such Subsidiary Borrower; provided, that each Subsidiary Borrower shall retain the right, in its
discretion, to give directly any or all of such notices or requests or to make directly any or all of such payments.
(g)
The obligations of each Borrower under this Agreement are several although the Subsidiary Obligations are
guaranteed by the Parent Borrower under Article IX.
SECTION 2.17. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender (including any Issuing Bank)
requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender (including
any Issuing Bank) or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender (including any Issuing Bank) pursuant to Section
2.15, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans (or
interests in Letters of Credit) hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender (including any Issuing Bank), such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or
reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender
(including any Issuing Bank) to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
Lender (including any Issuing Bank).
(b)
If (i) any Lender (including any Issuing Bank) requests compensation under Section 2.13, (ii) any Borrower
is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender (including any Issuing Bank) or any Governmental Authority for the
account of any Lender (including any Issuing Bank) pursuant to Section 2.15, (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (iv) any
Lender does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, modification, consent or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires the
72


================================================================================
[PAGE 227 OF 281]
================================================================================
consent of each of the Lenders or each of the Lenders affected thereby (so long as the consent of the Required Lenders (with the
percentage in such definition being deemed to be 66 2/3% for this purpose) has been obtained), then the Parent Borrower may, at its
sole expense (in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of this Section 2.17(b) only), upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative
Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 10.04, provided that the Parent Borrower shall be required to pay the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section
10.04(b)(ii)(C), or pursuant to deemed assignment provisions established by the Administrative Agent to which the Parent
Borrower has previously consented in writing), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall
assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Parent
Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be
withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the
assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other
amounts) (and, if such Lender is an Issuing Bank, all Letters of Credit issued by it shall have been cancelled or other arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank shall have been made with respect to such Letters of Credit), (iii) in the case of any
such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section
2.15, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (iv) in the case of an assignment pursuant to
clause (iv) above, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing. A Lender (including any Issuing Bank) shall not be required to
make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances
entitling the Parent Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. No such assignment shall be deemed to be a
waiver of any rights which any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.
SECTION 2.18. Change in Law. If (a) any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for any Issuing Bank to issue
Letters of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency or (b) there shall have occurred any change in national or international
financial, political or economic conditions (including the imposition of or any change in exchange controls) or currency exchange
rates that would make it impracticable for any Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit denominated in such Alternative Currency,
then by prompt written notice thereof to the Parent Borrower and to the Administrative Agent (which notice shall promptly be
withdrawn whenever such circumstances no longer exist), such Issuing Bank may declare that Letters of Credit will not thereafter
be issued by it in the affected Alternative Currency or Alternative Currencies, whereupon the affected Alternative Currency or
Alternative Currencies shall be deemed (until such notice is withdrawn) not to constitute an Alternative Currency for purposes of
the issuance of Letters of Credit by such Issuing Bank.
SECTION 2.19. Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a)
fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Available Commitment of such Defaulting Lender
pursuant to Section 2.10(a);
73


================================================================================
[PAGE 228 OF 281]
================================================================================
(b)
the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in
determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment,
waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.02); provided, that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting
Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of each Lender or each Lender affected
thereby;
(c)
if any LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i)
all or any part of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting
Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders’
Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting
Lenders’ Commitments;
(ii)
if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Parent Borrower
shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing
Bank only such Borrower’s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure (after giving effect to any
partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.04(k) for so long
as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii)
if the Parent Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to
clause (ii) above, the Parent Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section
2.04(f) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is
cash collateralized;
(iv)
if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees
payable to the Lenders pursuant to Sections 2.10(a) and 2.04(f) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting
Lenders’ Commitment; and
(v)
if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized
pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other
Lender hereunder, all fees payable under Section 2.04(f) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure shall be
payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash
collateralized; and
(d)
so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase
any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender’s then outstanding LC Exposure will
be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the applicable
Borrower in accordance with Section 2.19(c), and participating interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be
allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a
74


================================================================================
[PAGE 229 OF 281]
================================================================================
manner consistent with Section 2.19(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
If (i) a Bankruptcy Event or a Bail-In Action with respect to a Parent of any Lender shall occur following the date
hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in
fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Issuing Bank shall
not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have entered into
arrangements with the Parent Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to the Issuing Bank to defease any risk to it in respect of such
Lender hereunder.
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Parent Borrower and the Issuing Bank each agrees, acting in good
faith and a commercially reasonable manner, that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender
to be a Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s
Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative
Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Commitment.
SECTION 2.20. Extension of Maturity Date.
(a)
Request for Extension. The Parent Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly
notify the Lenders) not earlier than 60 days and not later than 30 days prior to the Maturity Date then in effect hereunder (the
“Existing Maturity Date”), request that each Lender extend such Lender’s Maturity Date for an additional 364 days from the
Existing Maturity Date; provided, however, that the Parent Borrower may not request more than two such extensions pursuant to
this Section 2.20.
(b)
Lender Elections to Extend. Each Lender, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by notice to the
Administrative Agent given not earlier than 45 days prior to the Existing Maturity Date and not later than the date (the “Notice
Date”) that is 15 days prior to the Existing Maturity Date, advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to
such extension (and each Lender that determines not to so extend its Maturity Date (a “Non‑Extending Lender”)) shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Notice Date) and any
Lender that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non‑Extending
Lender. The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree.
(c)
Notification by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Parent Borrower of each
Lender’s determination under this Section 2.20 no later than the date 15 days prior to the Existing Maturity Date (or, if such date is
not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day).
(d)
Additional Commitment Lenders. The Parent Borrower shall have the right on or before the Existing
Maturity Date to replace each Non‑Extending Lender with, and add as “Lenders” under this Agreement in place thereof, one or
more Eligible Assignees (each, an “Additional Commitment Lender”) as provided in Section 10.04 each of which Additional
75


================================================================================
[PAGE 230 OF 281]
================================================================================
Commitment Lenders shall have entered into an Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which such Additional Commitment
Lender shall, effective as of the Existing Maturity Date, undertake a Commitment (and, if any such Additional Commitment Lender
is already a Lender, its Commitment shall be in addition to such Lender’s Commitment hereunder on such date).
(e)
Minimum Extension Requirement. If (and only if) the total of the Commitments of the Lenders that have
agreed so to extend their Maturity Dates and the additional Commitments of the Additional Commitment Lenders shall be more
than 50% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the Existing Maturity Date, then, effective as
of the Existing Maturity Date, the Maturity Date of each Extending Lender and of each Additional Commitment Lender shall be
extended to the date falling 364 days after the Existing Maturity Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such
Commitment Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Lender shall
thereupon become a “Lender” for all purposes of this Agreement.
(f)
Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an extension of the Maturity Date
pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall not be effective with respect to any Lender unless:
(i)
At the time of and immediately after giving effect to such extension, no Default shall have occurred
and be continuing;
(ii)
The representations and warranties made by any Loan Party in or pursuant to the Loan Documents
shall be true and correct in all material respects (or, in the case of any representation and warranty qualified by materiality,
in all respects) on and as of the date of such extension (other than such representations as are made as of a specific earlier
date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier
date) (or, in the case of any representation and warranty qualified by materiality, in all respects as of such earlier date); and
(iii)
On or before the then applicable Existing Maturity Date, (1) the Borrowers shall have paid in full the
principal of and interest on all of the Loans made by each Non-Extending Lender to the Borrowers hereunder and (2) the
Borrowers shall have paid in full all other amounts owing to such Non-Extending Lender hereunder.
(g)
Amendment; Sharing of Payments. In connection with any extension of the Maturity Date, the Borrowers,
the Administrative Agent and each extending Lender may make such amendments to this Agreement as the Administrative Agent
determines to be reasonably necessary to evidence the extension. This Section shall supersede Sections 2.16 and 10.02.

================================================================================
ARTICLE III
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
The Parent Borrower represents and warrants and each Subsidiary Borrower represents and warrants (to the extent
specifically applicable to such Subsidiary Borrower) to the Lenders that:
SECTION 3.01. Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrowers, the Guarantors and the Parent Borrower’s
Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Regulation S-X, part 210.1-02 of Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations) is duly
organized, validly existing and, other than the Swiss Loan Party, in good standing (or, if applicable in a foreign jurisdiction, enjoys
the equivalent status under the laws of any jurisdiction of organization outside the United States of America) under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where
the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is
qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.
SECTION 3.02. Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions are within each Loan Party’s corporate powers
and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required, stockholder action. Each Loan Document has been duly
executed and delivered by each Loan Party which is a party thereto and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such
Loan Party, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation,
reconstruction, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless
of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
SECTION 3.03. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or
approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained or
made and are in full force and effect, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other
organizational documents of Parent Borrower or any other Loan Party or any order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not
violate or result in a default under any indenture or any material agreement or other material instrument binding upon Parent
Borrower or other Loan Party its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by Parent Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Parent Borrower or any of
other Loan Party.
SECTION 3.04. Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change. (a) The Parent Borrower has heretofore
furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheet and statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows (i) as of and
for the Fiscal Year ended March 30, 2019, reported on by Ernst & Young LLP, independent public accountants, and (ii) as of and
for the Fiscal Quarter and the portion of the Fiscal Year ended June 30, 2019, certified by its chief financial officer. Such financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the Parent
Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP, subject to year-end
audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes in the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii) above.
77


================================================================================
[PAGE 232 OF 281]
================================================================================
(b)

Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender (including each Issuing Bank) acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its
own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender (including each Issuing Bank) also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under
or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
The Syndication Agent and Co-Documentation Agents shall not have any duties or responsibilities under the Loan
Documents in their capacity as such.
Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y)
covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for
the benefit of, the Administrative Agent, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrowers or any other
Loan Party, that at least one of the following is and will be true:
(i) such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or
more Benefit Plans with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the
Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments, or this Agreement,
(ii) the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as PTE 84-14 (a class exemption for certain

transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving
insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTE 91-38 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank
collective investment funds) or PTE 96-23 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by in-house asset

is applicable with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans,
the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement,
(iii) (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the
meaning of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf
of such Lender to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and
this Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of
Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84-
14 and (D) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied
with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of
Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, or
(iv) such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Administrative
Agent, in its sole discretion, and such Lender.
In addition, unless sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or such Lender has
provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a),
such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants,
from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit
of the Administrative Agent, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, that
the Administrative Agent is not a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lenders’ entrance into,
participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement
(including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any Loan

ARTICLE IX
GUARANTEE
SECTION 9.01. Guarantee (a) The Parent Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders and their respective successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns, the
prompt and complete payment and performance by the Subsidiary Borrowers when due (whether at the stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise) of the Subsidiary Obligations (other than, with respect to any Guarantor, any Excluded Swap Obligations
of such Guarantor). As used in this Article IX, the term “Lenders” includes affiliates of Lenders which are parties to any Specified
Cash Management Agreements or Specified Swap Agreements.
(b)
The Parent Borrower agrees that the Subsidiary Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed
the amount of the liability of the Parent Borrower hereunder that would exist in the absence of this Article IX without
impairing this
99


================================================================================
[PAGE 254 OF 281]
================================================================================
Guarantee or affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder.
(c)
This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect until all the Subsidiary Obligations shall have been
satisfied by payment in full in immediately available funds, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and the Commitments
shall be terminated, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this Guarantee the Subsidiary Borrowers may
be free from any Subsidiary Obligations.
(d)
No payment made by any Borrower, any Guarantor, any other guarantor or any other Person or received or
collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from any Borrower, any Guarantor, any other guarantor or any other
Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or application at any time or from time to time
in reduction of or in payment of the Subsidiary Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect
the liability of the Parent Borrower hereunder which shall, notwithstanding any such payment (other than any payment
made by the Parent Borrower in respect of the Subsidiary Obligations or any payment received or collected from the Parent
Borrower in respect of the Subsidiary Obligations), remain liable for the Subsidiary Obligations until the Subsidiary
Obligations are paid in full in immediately available funds, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and the Commitments
are terminated.
SECTION 9.02. No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment made by the Parent Borrower hereunder or any set-
off or application of funds of the Parent Borrower by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Parent Borrower shall not be
entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Subsidiary Borrowers or any
other Guarantor or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the
payment of the Subsidiary Obligations nor shall the Parent Borrower seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement
from the Subsidiary Borrowers or any other Guarantor in respect of payments made by the Parent Borrower under this Guarantee,
until all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Subsidiary Borrowers on account of the Subsidiary
Obligations are paid in full in immediately available funds, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and the Commitments are
terminated. If any amount shall be paid to the Parent Borrower on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the
Subsidiary Obligations shall not have been paid in full in immediately available funds, such amount shall be held by the Parent
Borrower for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by the Parent Borrower, be
turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by the Parent Borrower (duly indorsed by the Parent Borrower
to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Subsidiary Obligations whether matured or unmatured, in such
order as the Administrative Agent may determine.
SECTION 9.03. Amendments, etc. with respect to the Subsidiary Obligations. The Parent Borrower shall remain
obligated under this Guarantee notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against the Parent Borrower and without
notice to or further assent by the Parent Borrower, any demand for payment of any of the Subsidiary Obligations made by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and any of the Subsidiary
Obligations continued, and the Subsidiary Obligations or the
100


================================================================================
[PAGE 255 OF 281]
================================================================================
liability of any other Person upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with
respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised,
waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, and this Agreement and any other documents executed
and delivered in connection therewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, in accordance
with Section 10.02, as the Administrative Agent (or the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be) may deem advisable
from time to time, and any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender for the payment of the Subsidiary Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released without affecting
the Parent Borrower’s obligations under this Article IX. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation
to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Subsidiary Obligations or for this Guarantee.
SECTION 9.04. Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. The Parent Borrower waives any and all notice of the
creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Subsidiary Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee; the Subsidiary Obligations, and any of them, shall
conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon
this Article IX; and all dealings between the Parent Borrower and any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance
upon this Article IX. The Parent Borrower waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or
nonpayment to or upon the Subsidiary Borrowers or any of the Guarantors with respect to the Subsidiary Obligations. The Parent
Borrower understands and agrees that this Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of
payment without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any of the Subsidiary Obligations or any other
collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance)
which may at any time be available to or be asserted by any Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person against the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of any Borrower or any
Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Subsidiary Borrowers for
the Subsidiary Obligations, or of the Parent Borrower under this Article IX, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When making
any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against the Parent Borrower, the Administrative
Agent or any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and
remedies as it may have against the Subsidiary Borrowers, any other Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral
security or guarantee for the Subsidiary Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments
from any Subsidiary Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee
or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of any Subsidiary Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or any
such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve the Parent Borrower of any obligation or liability under this
Article IX, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law,
101

================================================================================
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Parent Borrower under this Article IX. For the purposes hereof “demand”
shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.
SECTION 9.05. Reinstatement. This Article IX shall continue to be effective, or shall be reinstated, as the case
may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Subsidiary Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored
or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization
of any Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or
similar officer for, any Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments
had not been made.
SECTION 9.06. Payments. The Parent Borrower hereby guarantees that payments hereunder will be paid to the
Administrative Agent without set-off or counterclaim in dollars or the applicable Alternative Currency at the office of the
Administrative Agent located at 10 South Dearborn Street, 7th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60603-2300 and to the following wire
instructions of the Administrative Agent (or such other address or wire instructions of the Administrative Agent that may be

SECTION 9.07. Keepwell. Each Borrower Qualified Keepwell Provider hereby jointly and severally absolutely,
unconditionally, and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time for the
Parent Borrower to qualify as an Eligible Contract Participant during the Swap Guarantee Eligibility Period in respect of any Swap
Obligation (provided, however, that each Borrower Qualified Keepwell Provider shall only be liable under this Section 9.07 for the
maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 9.07, or
otherwise under this Guarantee, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for
any greater amount). The obligations of each Borrower Qualified Keepwell Provider under this Section 9.07 shall remain in full
force and effect until the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement have expired, been discharged or have otherwise been
terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each Borrower Qualified Keepwell Provider intends that this Section
9.07 constitute, and this Section 9.07 shall be deemed to constitute, a “keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of the
Parent Borrower for all purposes of section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

SECTION 10.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or
any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the Guarantee Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the Guarantee Agreement or consent to
any departure by any Borrower or any Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for
which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be
construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have
had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
(b) Neither this Agreement nor the Guarantee Agreement nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived,
amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers or the Guarantors, as
the case may be, and the Required Lenders or by the Borrowers or the Guarantors, as the case may be, and the Administrative
Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender
without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of
interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone
the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees
payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any
Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.16(b) or (c) in a manner that
would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) release all or
substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, without the written consent of each
Lender (except that no approval of the Lenders shall be required to release a Guarantor in connection with the disposition of all the
capital stock of such Guarantor not prohibited by the Loan Documents) or (vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or the
definition of “Commitment”, the definition of “Required Lenders”, the definition of “Applicable Percentage” or any other
provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make
any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; provided, further that no such
agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or an Issuing Bank without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be. If the Administrative Agent and the
Parent Borrower acting together identify any ambiguity, omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect in any provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, then the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower shall be permitted to amend,
modify or supplement such provision to cure such ambiguity, omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect, and such
amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.

including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one domestic counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Lead
Arrangers, collectively, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof and (ii) all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender,
including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one domestic counsel and one foreign counsel, as necessary, in each
applicable jurisdiction for the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with
the enforcement or preservation of its rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights
under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters
of Credit.
(b) The Parent Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Co-Documentation
Agents, the Lead Arrangers, each Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such
Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee,
incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of
this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties
hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by an Issuing Bank to honor a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any
property owned or operated by the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to
the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not such claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding is brought by the Borrower or any
other Loan Party or their respective equity holders, Affiliates, creditors or any other third Person and whether based on contract,
tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to
any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are found by a final,
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of, or material breach of its obligations under the Loan Documents by, such Indemnitee or such Indemnitee’s employer
or any Affiliate of either thereof or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, advisors or agents. Paragraph (b) of this
Section shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-
Tax claim.
(c) To the extent that the Parent Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative
Agent or any Issuing Bank under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, but without affecting the Parent Borrower’s obligations
thereunder, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is
sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related
expense, as the case may be, was
106


================================================================================
[PAGE 261 OF 281]
================================================================================
incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank in its capacity as such.
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no party hereto shall assert, and each such party hereby waives, any
claim against any other party and any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
(as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the
use of the proceeds thereof; provided that, nothing in this clause (d) shall relieve the Borrowers of any obligation they may have to
indemnify an Indemnitee against special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages asserted against such Indemnitee by a third
party.
(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.
SECTION 10.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing
Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) a Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by a Borrower
without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender (including any Issuing Bank) may assign or otherwise transfer its
rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be
construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby
(including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c)
of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, each
Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

Qualifying Bank) or, if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing, any

entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the
assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect
to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Parent
Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of the Parent Borrower shall be
required if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing;
(B)
each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement;
(C)
the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment
and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500;
(D)
the Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Administrative Questionnaire;
(E)
no assignment (including any assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund)
shall be permitted if, immediately after giving effect thereto, amounts would become payable by any Borrower under
Section 2.13 or 2.15 (including amounts payable under Section 2.15 in respect of withholding taxes) that are in excess of
those that would be payable under such Section in respect of the amount assigned if such assignment were not made;
(F)
no assignment shall be made to a natural person; and
(G)
no assignment shall be made to any Borrower or its Affiliates.
For the purposes of this Section 10.04(b), the term “Approved Fund” has the following meaning:
“Approved Fund” means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or
investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed
by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.
(iii)
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement
(including, in the case of any Non-U.S. Lender (including each Issuing Bank that is a Non-U.S. Lender), obligations under Section
2.15(f)), and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the
108


================================================================================
[PAGE 263 OF 281]
================================================================================
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in
the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 10.03);
provided, however, that no such assignment or transfer shall be deemed to be a waiver of any rights which any Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against such Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender (including an
Issuing Bank) of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.04 shall be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with, and
subject to the conditions set forth in, paragraph (c) of this Section.
(iv)
The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its
offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to
the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and each
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower, any Issuing Bank and (solely with respect to the
Revolving Credit Exposure of such Lender) any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(v)
Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an
assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the
processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by
paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information
contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the
Register as provided in this paragraph.
(c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank,
sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations, (C) the relevant Participant will have no proprietary interest in the benefit of this
Agreement or in any monies received by such Lender under or in relation to this Agreement, (D) the relevant Participant will under
no circumstances be subrogated to, or substituted in respect of, such Lender's claims under this Agreement or have otherwise any
contractual relationship with, or rights against, any Borrower under, or in relation to, this Agreement (except as set forth in the
following sentence with regards to benefits that each Participant is entitled to under Sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15 to the same extent
as if it were a Lender and had acquired an interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section) and (E) the Borrowers,
the Administrative Agent, the applicable Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to
which a Lender sells such a participation
109


================================================================================
[PAGE 264 OF 281]
================================================================================
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not,
without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (v) and
(vi) of the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, each Borrower
agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15 to the same extent as if it were a Lender
and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each
Participant shall also be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be
subject to Section 2.16(c) as though it were a Lender; provided that, the foregoing sentence shall not apply to Ralph Lauren Europe
Sàrl. Each Lender that sells a participation, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain
a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender
shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any
Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other
obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment,
Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.
The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive, and such Lender, each Loan Party and the Administrative Agent shall
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register pursuant to the terms hereof as the owner of such participation
for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.
(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15 unless such Participant shall have
complied with the requirements of such Section; provided, that in any case in which a Participant is so entitled, any such Participant
shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is
made with the Parent Borrower's prior written consent, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results
from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. A Participant that would be a Non-
U.S. Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless the Parent Borrower is notified of the
participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the applicable Borrower, to comply with Section
2.15(e) as though it were a Lender.
(d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no
such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall (i) release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any
such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto (ii) require any payments to be made by any Borrower or grant to any
person any more extensive rights than those required to be made or granted to the relevant Lender under the Loan Documents, or
(iii) upon any enforcement of such pledge or assignment of a security interest, result in any assignment, transfer or sub-
participation of any such rights under the Loan Documents which is in breach of this Clauses (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 10.04.

Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, and shall terminate at
such time as no principal of or accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement (other

Signature transmitted, to the extent permitted by Section 10.01 and this sentence, by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic
means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement, such other Loan Document or such Ancillary Document, as applicable; provided that nothing herein
shall require the Administrative Agent to accept Electronic Signatures in any form or format without its prior written consent and
pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided, further, without limiting the foregoing, (i) to the extent the Administrative Agent
has agreed to accept any Electronic Signature, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on such
Electronic Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Loan Party without further verification thereof

(iii) waives any argument, defense or right to contest the legal effect, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document and/or any Ancillary Document based solely on the lack of paper original copies of this Agreement, such other Loan
Document and/or such Ancillary Document, respectively, including with respect to any signature pages thereto and (iv) waives any

expenses arising as a result of the failure of the Borrower and/or any Loan Party to use any available security measures in
connection with the execution, delivery or transmission of any Electronic Signature.
SECTION 10.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a
particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
SECTION 10.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and
each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and
apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any
time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower against any of and all the obligations of
any Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall
have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured; provided that, to the extent
prohibited by applicable law as described in the definition of “Excluded Swap Obligation”, no amounts received from, or set off
with respect to, any Guarantor shall be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligations of such Guarantor. The rights of each Lender
under this

(d) Each party to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally

maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its
Affiliates’ directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors, in each case who have
a need to know such Information in accordance with customary banking practices (it being understood that the Persons to whom

National Association of Insurance Commissioners) (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena
or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or

its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to any Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Parent
Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii)
becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other
than a Borrower which is not subject to a confidentiality obligation known to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with
respect to such information. For the purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from any Borrower or
any Subsidiary relating to such Borrower, any Subsidiary or their respective businesses, other than any such information that is
available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by such
Borrower or any Subsidiary and other than information pertaining to this Agreement routinely provided by arrangers to data service
providers, including league table providers, that serve the lending industry; provided that, in the case of information received from
any Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.
Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information
as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
SECTION 10.13. Satisfaction in Applicable Currency. (a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it
is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent

114


================================================================================
[PAGE 269 OF 281]
================================================================================
other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.
(b) The obligation of each Borrower hereunder or in respect of the Letters of Credit to make payments in a currency
(the “Agreement Currency”) shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than the
Agreement Currency, be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may in
accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment
Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders in the Agreement Currency, the applicable Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such
judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and each Lender (as an alternative or additional cause of
action) against such loss (if any) and if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the Agreement Currency, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree to remit such
excess to the applicable Borrower. The obligations of each Borrower contained in this Section 10.13 shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.
SECTION 10.14. Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties,
each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the

and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by: the application of any Write-Down and Conversion
Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party
hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and
(b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
(i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected
Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and
that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such
liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
(iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of
the applicable Resolution Authority.
SECTION 10.15. No Fiduciary Duty. The Administrative Agent, each Lender and their Affiliates (collectively,
solely for purposes of this paragraph, the “Lenders”), may have economic interests that conflict with those of each of the
Borrowers, its stockholders and/or its affiliates. Each Borrower agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be
deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Lender, on the one
hand, and any Borrower, its stockholders or its affiliates, on the other. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
transactions contemplated by the
115


================================================================================
[PAGE 270 OF 281]
================================================================================
Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm’s-length commercial
transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrowers, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the
process leading thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Borrower, its
stockholders or its affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect
thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise any
Borrower, its stockholders or its Affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to any Borrower except the obligations
expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of any
Borrower, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that it has
consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own
independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. Each Borrower agrees that it will not claim
that any Lender has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such Borrower, in
connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
SECTION 10.16. USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby notifies the Borrowers
that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107‑56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the
“Patriot Act”), such Lender and Agent is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which
information includes the name and address of the Borrowers and other information that will allow such Lender or the
Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. The Borrowers shall provide such
information and take such actions as are reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in order to assist the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders in maintaining compliance with the Patriot Act.
SECTION 10.17. Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that the Loan Documents
provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Swap Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such
support “QFC Credit Support” and each such QFC a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect
to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S.
Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable
notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of
New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):
In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a
proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC
Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any
rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to
the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such
QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United
States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered
116


================================================================================
[PAGE 271 OF 281]
================================================================================
Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime,
Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support
that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default
Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were
governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is
